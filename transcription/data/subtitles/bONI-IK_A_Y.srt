1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
is continuing to struggle with some of the blood sugar issues.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,800
And she had eaten some things and thought that that would help her.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,460
But they arrived and she was still not feeling well.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,000
And so they ended up turning around and going back home.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,680
And so if you pray for Donna Norman Jean, I know they'd appreciate that.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,020
And Philemon, of course, we've been studying here for a number of weeks now.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,639
This is lesson number six.

8
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:25,059
And so we have gone through the first 14 verses

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,559
in our previous text of scripture last week.

10
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,799
We looked at verses eight through 14.

11
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,299
And as we looked at that passage of scripture, we really mentioned

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,139
how that Paul begins to make an appeal, if you will, a plea

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,099
to Philemon with regard to Onesimus.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
He's going to bring to the attention of Philemon

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,099
really the great purpose of this book.

16
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:51,979
And we know that as Paul is making this appeal to Philemon,

17
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:56,200
that he has revealed to Philemon that Onesimus

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,060
trusts at Christ as his savior.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,939
And what a great blessing that is.

20
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,220
And I mentioned last week, as you look at verse number 10,

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,360
that Paul says, I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.

22
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,940
And I mentioned how that even in times of adversity and difficulty,

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,660
when we're dealing with circumstances that are less than desirable

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,319
from our perspective, that as we yield ourselves to Christ,

25
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,839
that he will still use us for his honor and for his glory.

26
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:29,480
And every day isn't going to be your best day, but every day God is on his throne.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,440
Amen. And we find that even when we're in circumstances such as Paul,

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,199
he says, I was in my bonds, I was imprisoned.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,120
But yet Onesimus trusted Christ as his savior.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,739
And I'm so thankful for the perspective of the apostle Paul

31
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,459
and how God would use him.

32
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,339
Of course, Onesimus, as he mentions in the text of scripture,

33
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,080
he was unprofitable to Philemon.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,279
But now, after he's been saved, after he's been redeemed,

35
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,099
Paul says he's now profitable to thee.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,800
And what a blessing to think about times past, but now

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,279
and understanding how that God changes us and we are new creatures.

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,199
Philemon had been forgiven by the Lord.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,520
Onesimus now has been forgiven by the Lord.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,779
And now the real truth of the book, the the difficulty,

41
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:24,860
if you will, from a human perspective, is that now Philemon,

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,419
who had experienced the forgiveness of God, is now going to have to practice

43
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,580
forgiveness and forgiving Onesimus.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,139
The reality that is before us, and we've spoken about this before,

45
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:44,539
that two pillars of biblical Christianity are forgiveness and reconciliation.

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,740
And I'm so thankful for those pillars of biblical Christianity.

47
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,740
And I'm thankful that there's forgiveness with the Lord.

48
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,740
As I thought about this kind of introduction into the text

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,660
that we'll deal with this evening, I thought about the if we want to look

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,940
at it from the perspective of maybe the theory of forgiveness,

51
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,699
the discussion of forgiveness, it really is easy for us to talk about forgiveness.

52
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,179
It's easy for us to understand the principle of forgiveness,

53
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:15,259
the admonition that we've been given scripturally with regard

54
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,100
to forgiving one another.

55
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,339
But the reality is that we, as the people of God, it's not just theory.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Forgiveness should be practiced in our lives.

57
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,779
We should be people that forgive.

58
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,899
Why? Because we have been forgiven.

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,860
That's the truth of Ephesians four and verse number thirty two.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,259
And we ended last Wednesday evening by looking at that verse of Scripture

61
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,979
where the Bible says and be kind one to another, tenderhearted,

62
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:49,300
forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,660
And we find that I would say this admittedly this evening,

64
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,419
that there at times we could find the subject of forgiveness

65
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,779
to be quite difficult for us.

66
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,940
And I would say this, that forgiveness is difficult,

67
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,500
especially for us if we're operating in the flesh.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,660
But when we're dead to self, filled with the spirit, walking in the spirit,

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,140
then God enables us to forgive.

70
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,619
And what a joy and what a blessing.

71
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,980
And as we understand that Paul has given, he started this appeal.

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,220
He's now going to conclude his appeal.

73
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,420
I want you to notice the last phrase of verse number 17.

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,540
We'll use it for our title this evening.

75
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:40,700
Paul says, receive him as myself.

76
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,179
Receive him. That's Onesimus.

77
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,579
Receive him in the same manner that you would receive me, Philemon.

78
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,260
Receive him as myself.

79
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,980
If you're taking notes, I want you to notice, first of all, the perspective of Paul.

80
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,779
Often as you study the Scriptures in the New Testament,

81
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,859
God gives us an opportunity to read of really many things

82
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,899
with regard to the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul.

83
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,380
And as you study the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul,

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,980
when you study the interactions and that Paul has with other churches

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,779
and individuals, you have the opportunity to get a little bit of a glimpse

86
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,220
of the perspective that Paul had in life.

87
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,299
And we find that as we look at these verses of Scripture,

88
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:27,700
I believe that Paul is sharing with us and, of course, with Philemon

89
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,140
this perspective that he has.

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,820
And perhaps even as we consider the perspective of Paul,

91
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,579
that we would be mindful of how important it is that we would understand

92
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,739
where did he get that perspective?

93
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,100
And Paul gets the perspective that he has

94
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,899
as we look throughout the Scriptures by abiding in Christ.

95
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,540
Paul was a man that walked with God.

96
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,140
Paul was a man that was surrendered to the Lord.

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,779
Paul was a man, he wrote, I am crucified with Christ.

98
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,820
Now, he wrote that under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

99
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,700
if he really wasn't, God wouldn't have permitted him to write it.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,100
Amen. And so he is a man that's walking.

101
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,980
He's not perfect. None of us are.

102
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,619
But he's a man that's that's surrendered to the Lord.

103
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,420
That's walking with God.

104
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,100
And that no doubt forms and helps frame his perspective of life.

105
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,779
Notice, I want you to consider his perspective

106
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,579
regarding the circumstances faced, the circumstances

107
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,019
that Philemon was dealing with.

108
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,980
Notice in verse number 15, notice what Paul says.

109
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,179
For perhaps he, this is Onesimus,

110
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,179
for perhaps he, Onesimus, therefore departed for a season

111
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:40,380
that thou shouldest receive him forever.

112
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,859
Begin to think about the perspective of Paul in verse number 15.

113
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,700
And I begin to understand that Paul is not seeking to sugarcoat that.

114
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,140
He's not denying the fact that Onesimus departed.

115
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:58,899
But he says, perhaps he, Onesimus, therefore departed for a season

116
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:03,220
that thou shouldest receive him forever.

117
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,899
Yes, indeed, Onesimus had departed.

118
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,299
And that was unfortunate.

119
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,899
And it was also costly.

120
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,820
We understand as we go through the entirety of this short epistle

121
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,899
that it was costly to Philemon.

122
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,220
But the reality is that it was just a season.

123
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,700
I think about this as Paul makes this statement

124
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,779
that he departed for a season, thou shouldest receive him forever.

125
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,380
I think about the the looking beyond the immediate,

126
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,660
acknowledging God's work.

127
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,700
Sometimes what happens in life is we get so caught up in the season.

128
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,179
Right. And the season is but for a season.

129
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,820
Right. It shall come to pass.

130
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,140
I think about the the believers that Peter is writing about.

131
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:48,619
I think about the the believers that Peter is writing to.

132
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:51,940
And Peter's telling them that they're dealing with some difficulty.

133
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,420
No doubt they're dealing with some opposition and they're dealing

134
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,859
with some persecution.

135
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:59,579
But the reality is that it's just for a season.

136
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,739
It's not going to be forever.

137
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,140
It is going to come to an end.

138
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:08,459
And we begin to think about how Paul, when he mentions about

139
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,779
he has this eternal perspective in Second Corinthians, chapter number four,

140
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,260
he's not looking at just the temporary, he's looking at the eternal.

141
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,899
And as he begins to share his perspective with Philemon,

142
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,899
he says, listen, I understand that he departed for a season.

143
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,540
But that season has now come to an end because Onesimus got saved

144
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,580
and he's returning to you.

145
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,940
Remember, we dealt with that in the last text.

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,299
And so what happened for a season cannot control our forever.

147
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,380
Does that make sense this evening?

148
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,659
Sometimes what happens is we get so caught up in the season.

149
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,099
We get so busy living in the past season

150
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,460
that we can't really do in the present what God wants us to do.

151
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:57,380
Why? Because we're too busy living in the past.

152
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,659
And Paul doesn't deny the fact that Philemon departed,

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,179
but he's sharing here a perspective with regard to the circumstances

154
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:06,979
that were faced.

155
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:12,260
And I believe that it's helpful for us to acknowledge God's hand at work

156
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,099
and God's ability to work.

157
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:19,140
Listen, indeed, there are times in life when we make poor decisions.

158
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:23,900
There are times in life when others that we love make poor decisions.

159
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,419
And sometimes those decisions, of course, we understand

160
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,900
decisions always have consequences.

161
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:36,859
But the reality is that in spite of the decisions, God can still work.

162
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,340
Right, sometimes we forget that our God is able to work

163
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,299
in spite of our bad decisions.

164
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,580
Aren't you thankful for that, by the way?

165
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,140
Because there's not one in here, including myself,

166
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,580
that's not made a bad decision.

167
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,419
And with God, there's forgiveness.

168
00:09:54,859 --> 00:10:00,020
With God, there's the opportunity to see him work and to see him glorify.

169
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,180
and so we find here that Paul is giving us a perspective with regard to looking

170
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,980
if you will beyond the immediate really not living in the past and dealing with

171
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,140
what happened I can almost think about myself in this situation and perhaps

172
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,260
this evening if you'd put yourself in the text of Scripture you're Philemon

173
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:26,420
you've been wronged you have the law on your side this guy's cost you some money

174
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,900
and now he's coming back and Paul saying don't worry about what happened in the

175
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:41,060
past really Paul's given him a perspective to help him in his current

176
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,660
situation notice not only the perspective of Paul with regard to the

177
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,740
circumstances faced but I also believe that we see a perspective of Paul with

178
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,020
regard to the conversion of Onesimus notice in verse number 16 he says this

179
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:03,940
not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to

180
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,860
me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord now he's

181
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,060
saying here with regard to the conversion of Onesimus we've already

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,540
mentioned it we dealt with it more entirely last week from verse number 10

183
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,940
but we find that Paul is now saying listen he left you as a servant but he

184
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,540
is coming back above a servant he still has that responsibility as a servant

185
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,540
that has not changed but understand that now because of what happened because God

186
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,220
was able to work in those circumstances because God's purpose is greater than

187
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,540
any of us and we find that here this man Onesimus trusts Christ and now Paul says

188
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,700
listen he is a brother beloved man I this is wonderful when you think about

189
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:03,620
Paul giving this appeal and really giving this plea to Philemon with regard

190
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,140
to Onesimus notice what Paul says not only is he a brother beloved but notice

191
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,940
Paul says this specially to me now think about that because Paul had mentioned

192
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,180
earlier how that he had really had the mind to keep him but he would not keep

193
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,580
him without the mind of Philemon notice in verse number 13 whom I would have

194
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,220
retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the

195
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,620
bonds of the gospel he says but without my mind what I do nothing in verse

196
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,020
number 14 and so Paul sends Onesimus back to Philemon in order to have this

197
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,260
relationship dealt with the way that it's supposed to be and we find that

198
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,100
Paul however though he says to Philemon this man is a brother beloved and

199
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,620
especially to me but then notice what he says at the end of verse number 16 but

200
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:07,460
how much more unto thee how seriously I mean think about it from Philemon's

201
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,900
perspective and see Paul is giving this charge this this appeal but really

202
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,900
packaging wonderfully in this appeal to Philemon some biblical truth that ought

203
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,620
to be evidences in the lives of God's people remember Philemon it's already

204
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,500
been said of him that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ and he loved all the saints

205
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:40,500
but now here comes a test because he was a servant that ran away but now he's

206
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,940
returning as a saint and Paul says listen he is a beloved brother

207
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,900
especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord

208
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,220
and what great perspective that Paul is sharing here not only for Philemon

209
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,460
given the current circumstances but I believe for us as well as we're gonna go

210
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,060
through life the reality is that there are going to be times in our lives in

211
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,460
which people will hurt us there will be times in our lives just like it's easy

212
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,460
for us many times to share as someone else is dealing with great difficulty

213
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,380
the truth of Romans 8 28 we say hey listen brother we know that God works

214
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,060
all things for good right but when we're going through the situation man we just

215
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,060
somehow can't remember Romans 8 28 when somebody else is dealing with a great

216
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,940
difficulty such as what we're looking at in the book of Philemon contextually

217
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,300
with the the forgiveness we can give somebody counsel with regard to

218
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,300
forgiveness but oh how important for us to practice forgiveness in our own lives

219
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,740
and to gain this perspective that Paul is sharing in verses 15 and 16 and and I

220
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,860
see not only a perspective of Paul but I want you to notice in verse number 17

221
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,460
if you're taking notes I just have said this about verse number 17 the sincerity

222
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,820
of Paul I want you to think about Paul in this situation again I don't know how

223
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,820
long Paul had the opportunity to minister to Onesimus obviously God

224
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,700
allowed it to be such that Onesimus crossed paths with Paul while he was in

225
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,620
prison and Paul led him to Christ and there's some level of discipleship

226
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,740
training teaching something has gone on because there's some relationship here

227
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,020
where Paul is able to speak very highly of this man Onesimus and Paul has great

228
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,540
confidence that this man Onesimus is going to be a blessing to you Philemon

229
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,340
there's something that he's observed in the life of of Onesimus that's caused

230
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:56,580
him Paul to have this sincerity in this confidence with regard to the message

231
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,420
that he's sending back to Philemon you ever hear somebody say something like

232
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,660
this when they talk about somebody get saved getting saved and they'll say

233
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,940
something to this thing they really got saved and you kind of like you know

234
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,820
anyone that gets saved really got saved but you kind of understand what somebody

235
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,220
means when they say it that way and really they're talking about how

236
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,780
somebody that was just completely out of church not reading the Bible not

237
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,620
talking anything just about the Lord filthy language whatever and how they

238
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,500
get saved and man they're in church all the times the doors are open and they're

239
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,020
reading their Bible every day and they're praying and you're like man they

240
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,340
really got saved you understand I'm saying and I think that if I could use

241
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,580
that expression that we've heard and used perhaps in our own lives that I

242
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:51,740
think Paul sees that kind of genuine conversion in Onesimus and Paul has this

243
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,060
great level of sincerity with regard to the message that he's delivering to

244
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:05,340
Philemon but also with regard to Onesimus as an individual brother see

245
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:11,060
Paul is serious about the subject of forgiveness and reconciliation Paul

246
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,340
serious about that notice keep your place in the book of Philemon but turn

247
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:22,340
over the book of Galatians if you will look in Galatians chapter number six

248
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,900
in Galatians chapter number six in verse number one the Bible says brethren if a

249
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,500
man be overtaken in a fall ye which are spiritual restore such in one in the

250
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,260
spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bearing one

251
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,740
of those burdens so fulfill the law of Christ and he talks about if a man think

252
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,180
himself to be something when he is nothing he deceived with himself but I

253
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,300
want you to think about that phrase in verse number one when he talks about ye

254
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,220
that are spiritual ye which are spiritual restore such in one in the

255
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,140
spirit of meekness see as Paul is writing to Philemon the the reality as

256
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,220
we would look at the book of Philemon is it would seem abundantly clear and

257
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:20,780
obvious that Philemon is the more mature Saint right he's the one that he's been

258
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,100
saved longer we find that he's loving the Lord he's loving the Saints he's

259
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,700
obviously Paul talks about not only hearing of his love but also his faith

260
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,820
in verse number five of the book of Philemon and so we find that it seems as

261
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,580
if Philemon has been a man that has been walking with God he's growing and

262
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,900
so Paul is now saying to him listen you now have a responsibility with this

263
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,220
subject of forgiveness and reconciliation this man Onesimus yes he

264
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,780
left you and this is a difficulty that that came in your life but he's a

265
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:07,580
brother now he's been saved so I think about this for somebody in the church

266
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,660
that wasn't Philemon maybe they'd have a better time receiving Onesimus what I

267
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,300
mean by that well someone that wasn't hurt personally by Onesimus then

268
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Onesimus comes back to the church in the church like oh yeah welcome him in man

269
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:30,420
he's gotten saved but because Philemon has that personal connection to Onesimus

270
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,340
there's a little bit more of a difficulty now we don't read a response

271
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,220
from Philemon in the book and so I'm just trying to look at the book from how

272
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,619
I might receive it or how you might receive it because the reality is that

273
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:49,940
it's easy for me to say to somebody else that's been hurt by someone that just

274
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,820
forgive them restore them and then I'm the one that gets hurt by the individual

275
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,900
and then they're coming to me saying well forgive them

276
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,280
restore them, right? You understand. And so as we look at the book and we look at

277
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,000
this charge that Paul is giving, I see there's a level of sincerity that he is

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,280
very serious about this matter of forgiveness and reconciliation, but we

279
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:25,000
also see that Paul, he's serious about this man Onesimus. And notice what he

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,420
says, if thou count me therefore a partner. Now Paul makes that statement in

281
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,780
verse number 17, and that word partner carries with an idea of being a friend

282
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,540
or a companion. And the way it's written in the original language, and you can't

283
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,260
really, there's some means in which you can write in certain languages that

284
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,860
things are inferred or implied, and it doesn't really carry over into a

285
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,260
translation, and we understand that, but really what's implied by the

286
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,100
structure of the statement in verse number 17 is if thou count me therefore

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:14,260
a partner, and I know you do, receive him as myself. Receive him as myself. Then

288
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:24,980
Paul says to Philemon, receive Onesimus in the same way you would receive me. Now

289
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,580
I want you to think about that just for a moment, and I want you to think about

290
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,740
Philemon, and because we're in this building we'll use this as our example,

291
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:42,460
and Philemon is standing here at the front of the church, and Paul walks

292
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,420
through the back doors. How do you think Philemon would respond? How do you think

293
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,580
Paul would respond? It would be maybe something that we could refer to as a

294
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,660
great reunion, a level of excitement. You think about it in your own life, when

295
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,300
there's a brother, a sister in Christ, someone within the family of God, someone

296
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,780
within our church family that hasn't been able to be here for a season,

297
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,020
maybe they've dealt with some health issues, maybe there's been some other

298
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,580
things going on. Ronnie wasn't able to be here for a period of time because of his

299
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,420
mom and so on and so forth, and man, when Ronnie came back, man, we're excited to

300
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,580
see him, right? There's some missionaries that come that we haven't seen for a

301
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,980
while, and you're excited to see them. I was at a pastor's meeting, and as I was

302
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,220
at the pastor's meeting, this is several months ago, there was a missionary that

303
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,260
our church supports that I hadn't seen for a while, and man, I was excited to see

304
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:42,460
him. And we locked eyes, and we connected, and we gave a hug, we actually

305
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:51,020
embraced, and it was, man, it's so good to see you. Paul says, in that same way, if

306
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,140
Onesimus walks through those doors, that's how you're supposed to receive

307
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,020
them. Now, I want you to think about that, because if Philemon's standing down here

308
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,860
and Onesimus walks through the doors, there's a certain level of emotion and

309
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,140
thought that floods the mind of Philemon, right? He left me, he forsook me,

310
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:19,220
he stole from me, and if we're in the flesh, it is going to be impossible to

311
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,660
receive Onesimus the same way you would receive Paul. Does that make sense? This

312
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,820
is like graduate-level Christianity. This is serious. And Paul says, I understand

313
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,940
what's happened. Paul doesn't deny it. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, but he makes

314
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,420
an appeal based really upon the character of God. Philemon, you've been

315
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,980
forgiven. Philemon, this man is a, he's a saved man now. He has been changed. He's

316
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,460
more than a servant. He's above a servant. He is a brother beloved, and therefore,

317
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,500
Paul, excuse me, therefore, Philemon, you receive Onesimus in the same manner in

318
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,820
which you would receive me. Now, I'll be honest with you. When you understand it

319
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,300
this way, maybe we'd say something like this, can you give me a minute to process

320
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:27,820
this? If we'd be honest this evening, give me a minute to process this. Let me

321
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,340
deal with this. But as we're walking in the Spirit, as we're filled with the

322
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:41,140
Spirit, as we're dead to self, God will enable us to do what He's instructed us

323
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:52,180
to do. Jesus, how often should we forgive? Till seven times? Jesus said, no, not till

324
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:59,500
seven times, but till seventy times seven. How am I going to do that? You're not going

325
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,780
to do it in your flesh, I guarantee you. But as we walk in the Spirit, we're filled

326
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:14,380
with the Spirit. God will enable us. And Paul says to Philemon, receive him, receive

327
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:25,700
Onesimus as myself, in the same manner, Philemon, the same excitement, the same kind of embrace

328
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,860
that you'd have for me, that's why I want you to receive Onesimus. We need God's help

329
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,820
to do that. Listen, we cannot do that on our own. We need God's help. And we're reminded

330
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:46,380
as we look at a book like this, we're reminded how much we need Him. I need Thee every hour,

331
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,540
the songwriter said. Oh, we do. We need Him. Amen? Receive Him as myself. Let's pray.

332
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,740
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for the Word of God, the

333
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:06,220
truth contained therein. And I know the text of Scripture before us is challenging. I thank

334
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:19,140
You, God, for giving us an example, a situation that took place, that has been recorded, some

335
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:28,460
instruction that's been provided that shows us what forgiveness and reconciliation really

336
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:37,380
looks like. God, I thank You that You forgave me. And I thank You that You continue to forgive

337
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,460
me. And God, I pray that this matter of forgiveness would not just be something that we talk about

338
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,740
in theory. It would be something that is practiced in our lives. I pray that You'd

339
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,260
bless our time of prayer. We pray that You'd be exalted and magnified, and we'll thank

340
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,260
You for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen. Does anyone need a prayer bulletin? No, we

341
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,660
don't have any.
