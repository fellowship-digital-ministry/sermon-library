1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,079
with you Romans chapter number 12, Romans chapter number 12 and it certainly is a familiar portion

2
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:10,880
of scripture this morning. Romans chapter number 12, we'll look at a number of verses this morning

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,639
but as we think about our theme for the year, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

4
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:21,120
And we've had the opportunity throughout the calendar year, we're nearing the very end

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,200
and we've had the opportunity to discover God's greatness. We've spoken about those that have

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,120
declared God's greatness and then how do we respond? How does God's greatness impact your

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,680
life? How does his greatness impact my life? If I truly believe that God is great, it should be

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,439
evidenced in my behavior and we spent a number of weeks looking at the thought with regard to how

9
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,279
his greatness will shape our prayer lives. We spent some time looking at how his greatness

10
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:54,959
will impact and shape our service to the Lord and as we kind of look at this thought this morning

11
00:00:54,959 --> 00:01:00,240
in Romans chapter number 12, kind of bringing everything together that we've looked at throughout

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,879
the year and we deal with the subject matter of absolute surrender. When I truly understand how

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:14,959
great God is, it should impact every area of my life, every area of your life, we should be

14
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:22,080
surrendered to the Lord. Why? Because great is the Lord and he is greatly to be praised. He is deserving

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,400
of every aspect of our lives. The reality is that when we hear the word surrender,

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,279
when an individual hears that word, it can be met with a mixed type of response, various emotions

17
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:42,080
that someone may have with regard to the idea of surrender. In fact, some immediately will resist

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,160
the idea of surrender. Why? Simply because they desire to be in control. They don't want to

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,919
surrender, not even to God, and that's unfortunate. And we think about those that would resist. They

20
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:02,000
would respond with a resistance to the idea of surrender because they desire to be in control.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,080
I would say to you this morning that that response leads to a great struggle. That response not only

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,759
leads to a great struggle, but I believe this morning that it hinders our effectiveness for

23
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:24,320
the Lord. Our lack of surrender will have a direct adverse impact that will hinder our effectiveness

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,320
to the Lord. As believers, the concept, the idea of surrender is well known. In fact, we preach

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,320
about it, we read about it, we even sing about it. I surrender all. How many of you know that song?

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,080
Raise your hand. Help me this morning. How many of you know the song, I surrender all? Not every word

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,039
of it, but you're familiar with it. Almost everyone's hand was raised. I know this. Listen, we are

28
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:58,320
familiar with the idea of surrender. However, this morning, it isn't a matter of how much one knows

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:07,839
about surrender, rather how surrendered one is to the Lord. It's not enough to sing about surrender.

30
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,279
It's not enough to read about surrender. It's not enough to preach about or hear preaching

31
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:17,520
about surrender. The reality is that we can know a lot about a subject and still not do it, not

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,600
apply it. And we find that the idea, the word surrender, in Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary,

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:33,839
here's what the word surrender means. To yield to the power of another. To yield to the power

34
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:44,080
of another. To give or deliver up possession upon compulsion or demand.

35
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,839
Idea of compulsion, to be compelled, to be constrained. Keep that in mind as we think

36
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:55,360
about this subject matter of surrender and thinking about that definition to yield to

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,160
the power of another. As believers, when we speak about surrender, we're speaking about

38
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,440
surrendering to the Lord who was great, the one who created all things, the one who saved your

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,600
soul, the one that is worthy of our all. We speak about the subject of surrender and you could deal

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,880
with it in a number of contexts. You could deal with it from a military perspective, in one army

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,200
surrendering to another army. You can deal with it in a number of different contexts. But this

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,279
morning, as we deal with the subject of surrender, we're speaking about we as the people of God

43
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:35,600
surrendering to the King of kings and Lord of lords. We sing this song, it is best to let him

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,640
have his way with you. What is that? That's surrender. That's yielding. My life, Lord,

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,119
is yours to control. Is that not what the song says? That's what the songwriter says?

46
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:55,839
Why is it that the songwriter would be led to write a song, to write the words of that song

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,600
and then to sing that song because they understand the biblical principle of surrender?

48
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:07,760
Notice in Romans chapter number 12 in verses 1 and 2, the apostle Paul is writing to these

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,399
believers. He says, I beseech you, therefore, brethren. And so we find that he's writing to

50
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,559
believers. It's always important for us to understand the context. He's not writing to

51
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:24,320
lost people. This morning, the message to lost people throughout the Bible, the message to lost

52
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,920
people is you need to be saved. Amen? Repent and trust Christ as your Savior. It's the message that

53
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,359
Jesus delivered to Nicodemus, ye must be born again. That's the message to an unbeliever.

54
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,920
This morning, we find that this passage of scripture is written to people that have

55
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,279
already trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. Therefore, they are called

56
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,880
brethren. By the way, I'm thankful to be a brethren. I'm thankful to be saved this morning.

57
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,119
Amen? What a glorious, glorious truth. Notice it says, I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the

58
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:11,279
mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which

59
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:20,959
is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing

60
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:29,519
of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

61
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,640
This morning, as we deal with the subject matter of absolute surrender, I have simply two thoughts

62
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,399
for you this morning. Number one, if you're taking notes, the reason we should live a surrendered

63
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,880
life, the reason we should live a surrendered life. Now, remember the definition, to yield to

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,720
the power of another, to give or deliver up possession upon compulsion or demand. I'm

65
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,079
thankful that as you think about that truth of that definition from that 1828 Noah Webster's

66
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,119
dictionary, and we think about as a child of God, the reason that we should live a surrendered life,

67
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:12,079
I ask this question, what is it that compels or constrains the child of God? Well, if you take

68
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,440
your Bible and turn to the book of 2 Corinthians, we find that God tells us exactly what it is that

69
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,519
would compel or constrain us. And here's what the truth is, it is the love of Christ. We must never

70
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,920
get over the fact that God loves us. We must never get over the truth that we are loved by God. And

71
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,720
what does love reveal to us? What does love teach us? We find this morning that God loves us, and

72
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,239
so God instructs us. And of course, the greatest demonstration of God's love for us is sending His

73
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:49,600
Son to die for us so that we could be saved, so that we could be born again. But we find that He

74
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:58,000
loved in love. You know what God does? He corrects us. Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth. You say,

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,480
well, that's not very loving. No, it is loving. That is actually exactly what love is. If love,

76
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,600
if someone loves an individual, if God loves you as His child and He sees you going astray,

77
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,000
it is an act of love to correct and to chasten us. And how thankful we ought to be for that.

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,119
But notice in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 14, the Bible says, for the love of Christ

79
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:30,239
constraineth us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then we're all dead. Listen,

80
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:37,440
you were dead in your sins and your trespasses. You were dead. Here's the truth that someone

81
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,880
spoke. They articulated it this way that brought great conviction in the life of my Father.

82
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,880
It led Him to going to a Baptist church and hearing the gospel proclaimed and trusting Christ as His

83
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
Savior. Here's what it was. There's a lot of dead people that are walking around.

84
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,400
My dad said, what in the world is that guy talking about? And he said, well, here's the reality.

85
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,159
There's a lot of people that are dead spiritually. They're just alive physically. I hope that's not

86
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,479
you this morning. I mean, you have life physically, but I wonder this morning, do you have

87
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:15,599
life spiritually? Have you been born again? I'm not asking if you go to church. I know you're

88
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:20,159
here this morning. I'm not asking if you've done some kind of religious duties and you're following

89
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,520
some type of religion mandate. No, I'm asking, have you trusted Jesus Christ as your personal

90
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,039
Savior? It's the only way to be made alive. It's the only way to be born again is through the Lord

91
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,679
Jesus Christ. He said, I'm the way, the truth, and the life. No man, no one's going to get around

92
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:43,119
that. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. But I'm sincere. You can be sincerely wrong.

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,520
It's only through Jesus Christ. The love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge

94
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,960
that if one died for all, then we're all dead. That word constraineth, we talked about the

95
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,280
definition of surrender, to give or deliver up possession upon compulsion.

96
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,320
or demand, and really, it's that being compelled

97
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,420
or being constrained, and the word here

98
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 14,

99
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,600
to the love of Christ constraineth us,

100
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
it really carries two ideas with it.

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,440
One of them is this, to urge with irresistible power.

102
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
And then it carries with it this idea, to hold together.

103
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
And really, when you think about those two truths

104
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
and how they're coupled together

105
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,740
in that simple verse of scripture,

106
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,820
that the love of Christ constraineth us,

107
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,420
it urges us with irresistible power.

108
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,900
Listen, what does it urge us to do?

109
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,380
In just a minute, we'll read verse 15

110
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,020
and we'll see what it urges us to do,

111
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,340
but we find also that it holds us together.

112
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,820
It's as if the love of Christ, it holds us together,

113
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,380
it controls us, it's pushing on all sides,

114
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,980
and it's giving us that which holds us together.

115
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,040
But notice verse 15, and that he died for all.

116
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
Who is that?

117
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,860
That's Jesus Christ.

118
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,420
He died for all that they which live.

119
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,260
Who's that?

120
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,080
Well, that's us, those that have been born again,

121
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,940
should not.

122
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Now, that's pretty simple, is it not?

123
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,300
You should not henceforth no longer

124
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,880
should you live unto yourselves.

125
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,820
Why?

126
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,280
Well, because we're to live unto him

127
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,020
which died for them and rose again.

128
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,100
You know who you lived for before you got saved?

129
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,900
You know who I lived for before I got saved?

130
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,460
I lived for me.

131
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,840
And you live for you.

132
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,100
But if we truly understand the love of Christ,

133
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,500
if we truly understand this morning what he did for us,

134
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,380
it would compel us, it would constrain us

135
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,500
to voluntarily give up possession

136
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,180
to yield to the power of God

137
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,900
and no longer live for myself,

138
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,880
no longer live for yourself,

139
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
but live for him.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
Why?

141
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Because he loves us, because he demonstrated that love,

142
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,500
he died for us and he rose again.

143
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm thankful we serve a risen savior.

144
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
He's alive.

145
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
He lives, he rules and he reigns,

146
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,180
and we find this morning that as we look at this truth

147
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,360
that we should not no longer should we live for myself

148
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,800
but for Christ here in the book of Romans

149
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,040
in Romans chapter number 12,

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,720
it's nearing the end of the book of Romans

151
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
and we find that as he comes to this 12th chapter,

152
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Paul is literally begging the believers

153
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,640
and he's begging them really,

154
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,720
the basis of his plea is what had been previously revealed

155
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
in the book of Romans.

156
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
Remember, if you look back

157
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,520
and maybe you've held your place in Romans 12,

158
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,720
he says I beseech you therefore brethren

159
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
by the mercies of God.

160
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,040
Then we begin to understand

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,720
that Paul is giving this plea to the believers

162
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,920
and it's on the basis of what had been previously revealed

163
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,120
in this book of Romans

164
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,800
and we'll look at some things very quickly this morning

165
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,720
that had been revealed that would give Paul

166
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
the basis for which he's pleading

167
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
and begging with these believers

168
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,240
and then notice at the end of verse number one,

169
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,640
he says which is your reasonable service.

170
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,600
At the end of all of it,

171
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,280
it's just our reasonable service.

172
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,240
Sometimes someone that lives a surrendered life,

173
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,160
we might hold up on some great pedestal

174
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,800
and look at them and say look at this,

175
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
it's just reasonable service.

176
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,680
See when we truly understand what Christ has done for us,

177
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,400
the reason we should live a surrendered life

178
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,120
is because the only reason you have life

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,020
and the only reason I have life is because he died for me.

180
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,800
Apart from him, I'm nothing and so are you.

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,560
He said for without me, you can do nothing.

182
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,080
So notice, what is it that Paul had previously revealed

183
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
in the book of Romans?

184
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
We won't look at all of the verses for sake of time.

185
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll simply reference chapters

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,840
and I could provide you with the verses

187
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,160
if you would be interested in having them specifically

188
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,880
but for sake of time this morning,

189
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,480
let me just remind you that in Romans chapter number three,

190
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,760
Paul reveals that all mankind is guilty.

191
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
We're guilty sinners for all have sinned

192
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,920
and come short of the glory of God.

193
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,840
As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.

194
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,260
And so Paul, as you look at the book of Romans

195
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,000
and you consider the basis for the plea

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
in Romans chapter number 12,

197
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,380
we look at the truth in chapter number three

198
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,480
of the book of Romans that we're all guilty sinners.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Every single one of us.

200
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
You say, well, pastor, I'm a pretty good person.

201
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,800
No, you're guilty, you're a sinner.

202
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Well, I'm not as bad as, listen, the requirement,

203
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,120
the truth of God's word, the standard is not someone else.

204
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,480
The standard is the perfection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

205
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
And we're all guilty.

206
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,660
We all fall short of the glory of God.

207
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,640
He says in Romans chapter number five,

208
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
in chapter number six,

209
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,400
if you were to look at both of those chapters

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,340
and to work your way through those chapters,

211
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,880
you'd find that he reveals to these people,

212
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,280
he reveals to us as the word of God

213
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,840
has been preserved for us today

214
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,500
that the penalty for sin is death.

215
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Penalty for sin is death.

216
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,420
So he says, you're all guilty sinners.

217
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,880
No one's getting off the hook.

218
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,000
Everyone that's been born of man is a sinner.

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,680
And because of that sin, you are the penalty,

220
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,280
the just penalty, by the way, for sin is death.

221
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,920
For the wages of sin is death.

222
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,640
Now, we understand this morning

223
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
that it's more than just physical death.

224
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,020
We understand this morning, the Bible teaches us

225
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,900
as it had appointed unto man once to die,

226
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,540
but after this, the judgment.

227
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,700
There's some people that are living

228
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,940
upon the face of the earth today

229
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,100
that think that when they take their final breath

230
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,020
physically, that that's it, it's over, there's nothing more.

231
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,420
They could not be more wrong.

232
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,680
The Bible plainly teaches that after the physical death,

233
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,380
for the believer, there's life forever with Christ.

234
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,400
Hallelujah.

235
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,260
But for the lost individual,

236
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,100
they will stand at the judgment seat

237
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,060
at the great white throne judgment.

238
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,340
And as they stand at that judgment,

239
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,460
the Bible says that they'll be cast in a lake of fire.

240
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,720
This is the second death.

241
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,540
So we find that Paul, he says to these people in Rome

242
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,660
that we're all guilty sinners in chapter number three.

243
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,020
In chapters five and six, he says that the penalty,

244
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,060
the just penalty for sin is death.

245
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,140
He then says this in those same chapters,

246
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,960
chapters five and six, he says, what a wonderful truth,

247
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,520
the gift of God is eternal life.

248
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,840
And that gift is made possible through the death, burial,

249
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,680
and glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

250
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
He says that you're all sinners

251
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
and the penalty for sin is death.

252
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,120
If it stopped there, it'd be just,

253
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,620
it would not be called the gospel.

254
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,460
You know why?

255
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,400
Because the gospel means good news.

256
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,720
And if it ended there, it would not be true

257
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,080
to call it the gospel, but I thank God

258
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
that it doesn't end there.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
He says, listen, you're guilty, you're a sinner,

260
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,320
and the wage of sin is death, but what a great conjunction.

261
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,240
The gift of God is eternal life

262
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,760
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

263
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,200
And we find this morning that that wonderful gift,

264
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,840
what a great contrast between the thought of a wage

265
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,880
and the thought of a gift.

266
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
A wage is something that we earn.

267
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,920
A wage is something that we work for.

268
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,280
And many of us throughout this week,

269
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,480
we have the opportunity to work a job.

270
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,080
And as we work that job, we have an opportunity

271
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,760
to earn a living, to make a wage

272
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
because of our labor, because of our work.

273
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,520
And we understand in our economy today,

274
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,960
we understand what wages are.

275
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,760
The end of the week, depending on how often you get paid,

276
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,160
but if we could use the illustration,

277
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,440
at the end of the week, you worked your hours

278
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,280
and you get paid, it is your wage, it is what you earned.

279
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,120
Your boss does not come and say, here's a gift for you.

280
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,080
No, I worked for that, right?

281
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
We also understand what a gift is.

282
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,040
In fact, this time of year in our culture,

283
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,280
the idea of giving gifts is very prevalent.

284
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,960
In fact, the marketing industry has capitalized on it,

285
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
have they not?

286
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,240
We purchase gifts and we exchange gifts.

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
And something interesting about the gift

288
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
that you'll receive, if you receive a gift

289
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,520
this Christmas season from maybe a loved one,

290
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,560
you receive that gift, they paid for it

291
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
and they gave it to you.

292
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
And simply all you must do is receive that gift.

293
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,440
So the gift that God offers to us this morning,

294
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,840
as we look at this truth of living a surrendered life,

295
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,560
why should I live a surrendered life?

296
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,960
What is it that compels or constrains us

297
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,000
as a child of God to live a surrendered life?

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
We understand that we're guilty sinners

299
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,800
and the payment is death, the wage of sin is death,

300
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,680
but we understand that Jesus Christ died for us.

301
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,160
He paid in full for your salvation.

302
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,560
He offers that gift.

303
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,800
And as he offers that gift, all we must do is receive it.

304
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,280
We find that we come to the 10th chapter

305
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
of the book of Romans and we find that

306
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,480
as we come to that chapter, a very famous,

307
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
a familiar, precious truth is revealed in verse number 13,

308
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,600
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

309
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,800
shall be saved.

310
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,760
Aren't you thankful this morning that you're a whosoever?

311
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,240
I'm so thankful that somebody gave me the gospel.

312
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm so thankful this morning that Jesus paid.

313
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,600
He paid it all and he offered me the free gift.

314
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,440
And he said, there's nothing you can do to earn this.

315
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,880
There's nothing you can do to work for this.

316
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,280
I simply give it to you.

317
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,560
as a free gift if you'll simply receive it.

318
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
You know what's sad to me is how many people

319
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,640
reject the gift.

320
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,500
By the way, it's not customary in our culture

321
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,960
to reject gifts.

322
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Sometimes you might feel uncomfortable

323
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,500
when somebody brings you a gift.

324
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,340
Maybe you have the thought,

325
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,240
well, I don't have anything to give them.

326
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,140
But it's not customary in our culture to reject the gift.

327
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,200
And we find here this morning that how many people

328
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
in your life, in my life, that I have shared with them

329
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,820
the gift of God, which is eternal life,

330
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,520
that they say, no, thank you.

331
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,520
I'm not interested.

332
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,600
Maybe they say, I'm gonna try to earn it myself.

333
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Maybe they've been influenced by some false teaching,

334
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,920
some false religion that gives them the idea

335
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,720
that they could earn their own salvation.

336
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,480
It can't be that easy.

337
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Listen, it might be easy for us,

338
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
but it costs Jesus everything.

339
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,360
Not only did he suffer on a cruel cross,

340
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,380
but he left the glory of heaven,

341
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,340
the splendor and the glory that he had

342
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,540
with the Father from ages gone by for all of eternity,

343
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,180
he left that so he could come to a sin-cursed world.

344
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,260
We find this morning he said,

345
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,340
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

346
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,100
shall be saved.

347
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,340
Think of this truth in Galatians 2.

348
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,220
So Paul writes to these believers in Rome

349
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,140
and he tells them, you're guilty sinners,

350
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,140
but the wage, the payment for that sin is death,

351
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,740
but Jesus Christ died for you

352
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,380
and he offers you this free gift

353
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,000
and if you call on him, he'll save you.

354
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,020
Therefore, I beseech you, therefore, brethren,

355
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,580
by the mercies of God that you present your bodies

356
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,020
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,

357
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,660
which is your reasonable service

358
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,380
when you understand the foundation

359
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,300
by which we find in the book of Romans,

360
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,780
it seems as if it would simply be

361
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,380
that we as God's people, we would live surrendered lives,

362
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,380
we would voluntarily yield to Christ

363
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,380
because we understand what he did for us.

364
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,820
It's amazing how many of God's people,

365
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,260
how often in my life I try to live for myself,

366
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,160
I try to take back that control.

367
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,660
Paul, he didn't simply beg others,

368
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,740
he did not simply encourage others

369
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,300
to live a surrendered life,

370
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,780
but we find that Paul himself lived a life of surrender.

371
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,820
In fact, we're familiar with Galatians 2 in verse 20.

372
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,140
Why does Paul say I'm crucified with Christ?

373
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,680
Why does he say this truth of his position of surrender?

374
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,260
If you look at the end of the verse,

375
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,260
he says this, who loved me and gave himself for me.

376
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,420
What's the reason, child of God?

377
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,800
What's the reason that we should live a surrendered life?

378
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,780
Because he loved me and he gave himself for me.

379
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,580
Because without him, I'd be hopeless and helpless.

380
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,600
You know where you'd be this morning without Christ?

381
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,620
I don't even like to think about it.

382
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,620
I don't know where I would be like geographically today

383
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
without Christ, I'm not sure.

384
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,220
But I know where I would be headed today without Christ

385
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,020
and that's to a Christless eternity

386
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,960
to a place called the Lake of Fire.

387
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,220
Oh, what grace and what mercy, what love.

388
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,340
We find that in 1 Corinthians 6 in verses 19 and 20

389
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,420
that Paul, as he's speaking to the believers

390
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,720
there in Corinth, he says what?

391
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,020
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost

392
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,780
which is in you, which you have of God,

393
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,740
and you're not your own, why?

394
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,140
He says it this way, for you are bought with a price.

395
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,900
Therefore, because you've been bought with a price,

396
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,940
we are to glorify God.

397
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,860
How is it that we live a life that would bring glory to God?

398
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,780
Will we live a life that would bring glory to God

399
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,860
by living a life of surrender?

400
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,180
He says therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit

401
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,140
which are God's.

402
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Listen, I am bought with his precious blood.

403
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,740
If you're saved this morning, you've been bought

404
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,820
with the precious blood of Christ,

405
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,360
you are no longer the owner of you.

406
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,220
Amen?

407
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,740
You're not.

408
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,980
And by the way, you thought you owned yourself before,

409
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,940
but you were really owned by the devil.

410
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,780
If you go back and you read the book of John,

411
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,680
you'll understand in John chapter number eight that truth.

412
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Listen, I'm so thankful that I'm owned by Christ.

413
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,360
I've been bought with a price.

414
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,380
Therefore, what's the impact of that?

415
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,500
The impact is that I live a surrendered life.

416
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,180
Now understand this morning that though we can give

417
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,700
the reason, and even as I said by way of introduction,

418
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,900
it really is not about how much we know about surrender.

419
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,980
It's not the verses that we could look to.

420
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,140
It's not the songs that we could sing.

421
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,100
No, it's really how surrendered are we?

422
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,020
I said this in Sunday school this morning.

423
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,900
We talked about the subject of obedience

424
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,060
in Sunday school this morning.

425
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,840
It's not a matter of how much you know about the Bible.

426
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,380
It's a matter of how much of the Bible you obey.

427
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,180
I can quote the whole book of,

428
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,780
how much of it are you obeying?

429
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm not saying that you shouldn't memorize the Bible.

430
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,540
You should.

431
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
The Bible says that we're to memorize it,

432
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,700
but what I'm saying is that it's not about being able

433
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,580
to win a contest of Bible,

434
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,180
some kind of Bible game of trivia pursuit type of Bible game

435
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,460
and Bible knowledge game.

436
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,260
No, no, no, how much are we obeying?

437
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,820
And the truth is the same here with surrender.

438
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,500
It's not about knowing about surrender.

439
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,400
It's about being surrendered.

440
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,460
The reason, simply put, because He loved me

441
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,020
and gave Himself for me because He saved my soul.

442
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,860
Number two this morning, if you're taking notes,

443
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,780
not only the reason that we should live a surrendered life,

444
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,420
but what's the result of living a surrendered life?

445
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,740
What's the result?

446
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,660
I believe that when we live a surrendered life

447
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,780
that we'll live a life of obedience

448
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,180
and submission to the Lord because I'm surrendered to Him.

449
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,020
I have yielded, I have voluntarily given myself

450
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,820
to a place of surrender to the power of another

451
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,300
and that being the Lord and understanding

452
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,260
that as I understand the basis for which I should surrender,

453
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,180
but then the result is that I live a life

454
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,340
of obedience and submission.

455
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,820
Look over at Romans chapter six

456
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,380
and then we'll go over to a passage in 2 Corinthians.

457
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,860
Romans chapter number six, notice what the Bible says

458
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,420
and we've referenced a number of verses

459
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,460
throughout the book of Romans

460
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,420
without turning to them specifically,

461
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,120
but I want you to notice in Romans chapter number six.

462
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,180
In Romans chapter number six,

463
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,340
the Bible says in verse number 10,

464
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,700
for in that he died, he died unto sin once,

465
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,940
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

466
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,860
Likewise, reckon ye also yourselves

467
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,140
to be dead indeed unto sin,

468
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,420
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

469
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,780
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body

470
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,740
that you should obey it in the lust thereof.

471
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,940
Neither, notice what it says,

472
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,180
neither yield ye your members

473
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,300
as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,

474
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,980
but notice what that phrase says,

475
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,020
yield yourselves unto God.

476
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,620
As those that are alive from the dead

477
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,620
and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

478
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,820
The Bible says in verse 16,

479
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,580
know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves,

480
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,960
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom you obey,

481
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,060
whether of sin unto death

482
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
or of obedience unto righteousness.

483
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,180
And what a privilege to be able to surrender,

484
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,260
yield to God.

485
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
What is the result?

486
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,100
Well, look at 2 Corinthians chapter number eight,

487
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,020
we'll look at an example here in the New Testament

488
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,320
of some people that lived lives of surrender.

489
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,040
They lived lives of surrender.

490
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,700
Speaking of the churches of Macedonia

491
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,800
in this particular passage of scripture,

492
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,100
as Paul is making an appeal to the church at Corinth,

493
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,340
and as he makes this appeal to the church at Corinth,

494
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,020
he uses the example of the churches of Macedonia.

495
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,500
And as he uses the example of the churches of Macedonia,

496
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,020
we find that they were giving

497
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,980
and the context is with regard to giving,

498
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,560
but I want you to understand

499
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,280
the fact that they were surrendered.

500
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,380
Notice in verse number one

501
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,900
in 2 Corinthians chapter number eight,

502
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,060
the Bible says, moreover, brethren,

503
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,340
we do you to wit of the grace of God

504
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,100
bestowed on the churches of Macedonia,

505
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,420
how that in a great trial of affliction,

506
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,460
the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty

507
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,320
abounded under the riches of their liberality.

508
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
Now, the truth is that verse number two

509
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
could occupy our time for a long time.

510
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,680
Why?

511
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,420
Because it's amazing what God reveals to us

512
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,160
in verse number two about the people

513
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,680
in these churches of Macedonia.

514
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,520
Notice very quickly with me,

515
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,620
we don't have much time,

516
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,100
but notice they had a great trial of affliction.

517
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,040
But in the midst of that great trial of affliction,

518
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,120
there was an abundance of joy.

519
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,280
Now, that ought to cause us to stop in our tracks.

520
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Why?

521
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,520
Because normally, if there's a great trial of affliction,

522
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,560
it's not coupled with great joy.

523
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,100
Am I accurate?

524
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,720
Come on.

525
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
But he says that in this great trial of affliction,

526
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,800
the abundance of their joy,

527
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,200
notice in their deep poverty.

528
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,520
Now, understand.

529
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,880
That the poorest among us

530
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,640
is wealthy by the world's standards. You can go to a lot of places around the face of this world.

531
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,080
You saw pictures from Brother Jeff last Sunday night, if you were here, of some folks in Fiji.

532
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,440
And you saw some pictures of the houses. We have a shed that we keep our tractors in

533
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,280
that look nicer than some of those houses. I'm just being honest.

534
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,360
Brother Jeff, is that true? You were there. I saw pictures, but you were there.

535
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,520
The poorest among us is wealthy.

536
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,480
But when it says of their deep poverty,

537
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,880
and coupled with that, notice the riches of their liberality.

538
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,520
Do you remember the time in the life of Christ when he observed those that were giving?

539
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,400
And here come the religious leaders, and they want everyone to see how much they're giving.

540
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,760
And what does the Bible tell us? They're giving out of their abundance,

541
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,840
out of their plenty. And then he sees a widow woman.

542
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,520
She comes and she gives, and you know the amount that she gave was nominal.

543
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,440
From an economic perspective, it wasn't going to help with anything.

544
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:29,000
But you know what Jesus said? She gave more than all the others. Why? Because she gave everything.

545
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,280
She gave everything. That's amazing to me. And here, these believers in these churches

546
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,200
of Macedonia, they had a great trial of affliction, but yet they had an abundance of joy.

547
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,520
Abundance of joy. They had deep poverty, yet they were liberal in their giving.

548
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,040
Notice why. What would lead somebody to that? Why in times of great affliction would you have joy?

549
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Why in times of great poverty would you give? Notice in verse number three,

550
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,440
for to their power I bear record, yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves,

551
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,840
praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship

552
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,600
of the ministering to the saints, and this they did not as we hoped. But notice this,

553
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:21,000
and I have it circled in my Bible, but first gave their own selves to the Lord

554
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,840
and unto us by the will of God, insomuch that we desired Titus, and as he had begun,

555
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:36,520
so he would also finish in you the same grace also. The truth of verse number five is impactful.

556
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,480
The Bible says that as Paul rehearses the behavior of these believers in these churches

557
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,680
of Macedonia, and as he is rehearsing and challenging the believers in Corinth with

558
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,080
the example of these believers from these churches in Macedonia, he says, I want you

559
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,040
to understand that they did this, but the way, the reason that they did this is that first

560
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:05,160
they gave their own selves to the Lord. I believe that's a great picture of surrender,

561
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,680
of surrender. Lord, everything that I have, everything that I am is yours, Lord.

562
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,600
Now, understand that truth this morning. That is a deep, impactful truth,

563
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,840
and no doubt in my life and in your life, there are some things that we hold grips on

564
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:33,240
a little tighter than other things. Is it not true? Sometimes we struggle with the idea of

565
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,080
surrender. Why? Because I want it. I want to do what I want to do. I want to have my

566
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,040
control in my life. We find that they first gave their own selves to the Lord

567
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,880
and unto us by the will of God. What's the result of living a surrendered life? Well,

568
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,800
it's obedience and submission to the Lord, but what does it lead to? What does it look like?

569
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,800
What happens? What is the result when we live a life that is surrendered to the Lord? Well,

570
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:09,160
I believe, first of all, the Lord is magnified. The Lord is magnified. Listen, in our lives,

571
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,679
in your life and in my life, we ought to desire nothing more, nothing less, but then for Jesus

572
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,119
Christ alone to be magnified, to be exalted. You know how that's achieved? You know how that's

573
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,720
accomplished? By living a life of surrender, by living a life of surrender. Because through

574
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,760
living that life of surrender, which results in obedience and submission to the Lord,

575
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,959
it leads to a place of God being magnified. Let God be magnified. You read that in Psalm 70.

576
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:43,399
Let God be magnified. You read that John the Baptist, he said, he must increase, I must decrease.

577
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,440
And the idea this morning that we desire that through our lives that the Lord Jesus Christ

578
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,200
would be magnified. I said this by way of introduction that when we struggle with the

579
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,920
idea, when our response of resisting the idea of surrender, that it leads to great struggle in the

580
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,959
life of a believer and it hinders our effectiveness for the Lord. You want God to be magnified?

581
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:20,520
I hope your answer would be yes. Live a life of surrender. Lord, take my life and let it be.

582
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:30,600
Lord, you died for me. You loved me. You gave me life. I just want to live for you.

583
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,200
We find that it will lead to the Lord being magnified. I believe this morning that it will

584
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,959
lead to brethren being edified. We see it here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 8.

585
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,040
How that through this gift that they would give, how that others would benefit and be

586
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,000
encouraged and be edified. And we know that Paul is using this passage of scripture not

587
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,559
only as a great encouragement to him. I believe that if you read verse number 5,

588
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,959
the beginning part when it says, and this they did not as we hoped. I mean, they did beyond what

589
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:11,239
Paul could imagine. Could you imagine seeing the poverty of these individuals and yet they're giving

590
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:22,440
liberally. It's difficult to receive. And Paul says they did beyond what we even really expected,

591
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,080
not as we had hoped. Brethren are edified. I believe this morning when we live a life of

592
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:38,839
surrender that the lost will be impacted. The lost will be impacted. See, this morning we begin

593
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,320
to think about this idea of living a life of surrender and understanding the truth of that

594
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,119
that word being yielded. It's interesting, we won't take time to read the whole portion of

595
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,080
scripture, but if you want to jot it down in your notes, maybe in reference back, it's a familiar

596
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,559
passage of scripture in the book of Daniel in the third chapter. And we're familiar with this

597
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,440
portion of scripture with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and all that took place with the

598
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,399
idea of the bowing down when they would hear the playing of the music and to worship the

599
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:16,600
image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. But after God had delivered, and I'm just giving the very

600
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,679
abbreviated version of Daniel chapter number three, they refused to bow down and they found

601
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:31,480
themselves in a fiery furnace. And the Bible says that Nebuchadnezzar was astonished. He was a

602
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,399
stone-eyed, the Bible says in Daniel chapter three and verse number 24. What was it that

603
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:40,200
impacted Daniel, or excuse me, what was it that impacted Nebuchadnezzar? It was the fact that

604
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,119
those three Hebrew young men that he threw in the fiery furnace, that they were now loosed and they

605
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:55,000
were walking around and there was a fourth that was like unto the Son of God. And we find that

606
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,679
as you look at the passage of scripture that eventually through a series of events, the

607
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,760
guys, those men, they're brought forth and as they come out, notice what Nebuchadnezzar says

608
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,520
in verse number 28. Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach,

609
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,440
and Abednego. Why? Who had sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him. So

610
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,839
what do we learn about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Well, they trusted in the Lord. They

611
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,720
said to Nebuchadnezzar before they were thrown into the fiery furnace that our God is able to

612
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,599
deliver. Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. Now for a

613
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,559
moment of time, I don't really believe that Nebuchadnezzar thought that was true. I don't

614
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,320
think that Nebuchadnezzar thought that these guys would be able to be delivered from this fiery

615
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:49,640
furnace. I mean, you're saying that your God is able? Remember who Nebuchadnezzar is. He's the

616
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,840
ruler of the known world, the Babylonian kingdom. I mean, they just conquered so many people.

617
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,039
And here we find that the Bible says that his servants that trusted in him and then notice

618
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:06,039
and have changed the king's word. And then there's this little phrase and yielded their bodies.

619
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Who did they yield their bodies to? Well, I believe ultimately they yielded themselves to God.

620
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,359
They yielded themselves to God. And they were willing to go into that fiery furnace. Why?

621
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,559
Because they were not going to bow down before that image. When we begin to think about

622
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:27,239
surrender and living a life of surrender, you know, Nebuchadnezzar was greatly impacted so much so

623
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,119
that he says in verse number 29, there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

624
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,960
You know, when we live a life of surrender, God will be magnified.

625
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,039
The brethren will be edified, but lost people will be impacted.

626
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,320
Simply this morning, as we think about all of the messages I've preached throughout the year

627
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,720
with regard to how great God is, I believe that very easily this morning we should all acknowledge

628
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:05,200
That our God is such a great God and His love constrains us that we should live surrendered

629
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,680
lives.

630
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,220
But knowing what we should do isn't always what we do, right?

631
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:18,320
We know what we should do, but we don't always do what we should do.

632
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,160
This morning I wonder, as we evaluate our lives personally, are we living a life that's

633
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,360
surrendered to God?

634
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,120
Let me ask it this way.

635
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,160
Is there a part of your life that's not surrendered to God?

636
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,420
The Holy Spirit of God is able to work in amazing ways and He can take His divine finger

637
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,160
and point the life of every believer and say, what about this area of your life?

638
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,180
I just wonder this morning, is there an area in your life, is there an area in my life

639
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,080
that I'm not surrendered to the Lord?

640
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,140
If not, why not?

641
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:05,780
What would keep you today from saying, as we sing the song, I surrender all?

642
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:12,920
I think this morning, in my life, and for most believers today, that it would be better

643
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,380
if we would sing, I surrender some or I surrender most.

644
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Why do I say that?

645
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:26,160
Because I don't care if you're singing a song, if it's not true, it's lying.

646
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
Can we truly sing, I surrender all?

647
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,100
Or would it be better to say, I surrender some or most?

648
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:42,680
This morning, the reason we're compelled, we're constrained because of the love of Christ.

649
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,120
It results in God being magnified, the brethren being edified, and the lost being impacted.

650
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,580
This morning, absolute surrender.

651
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,860
What's keeping you from surrendering to God?

652
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Let's pray.

653
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
Father, we love you.

654
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,860
We thank you for loving us or we thank you for our salvation this morning.

655
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,380
God, if there's one that's here that's not saved, God, I pray that they'd understand

656
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,500
this morning, plainly and clearly, their need for salvation.

657
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:18,140
God, I pray that they would surrender in this area of their lives and they would accept

658
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,160
the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

659
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,240
Oh, Holy Spirit, I pray that you'd draw them to yourself, that you'd work as only you can.

660
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Father, I think of the many believers that are here this morning.

661
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:43,240
God, as we take this moment of invitation to examine and evaluate our own lives, I pray

662
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,420
that we'd be honest in our evaluation.

663
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Are we surrendered?

664
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,380
Is there an area of our life that's not surrendered, that we're holding back?

665
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:58,420
God, would you help us to surrender all?

666
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,780
Would you use us, God, for your honor and for your glory?

667
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,220
I pray that you'd move, work as only you can.

668
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,860
I pray that decisions would be made that would be long-lasting.

669
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,120
Decisions not made on emotion, but made on principle of your Word.

670
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,480
God, I pray that you'd use us for your honor and glory.

671
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,400
Well thank you for it, in Christ's name we pray.

672
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,280
Would you stand with me?

673
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,000
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
