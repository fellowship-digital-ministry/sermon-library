WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
that President at that time Woodrow Wilson issued a presidential proclamation

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.520
that officially established the first National Mother's Day holiday to celebrate America's

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.680
mothers. We understand that prior to that official date there are many states that already celebrate

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.079
it and they kind of had their own time of celebrating and recognizing but this was the

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:28.079
first National Mother's Day. The idea for Mother's Day is credited by some to a lady by the name of

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:36.560
Julia Ward Howe which was in 1872 and by others to Anna Jarvis 1907. Most would give the credit

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.599
to Anna Jarvis for all of her hard work on sent thousands of letters and lobbied and petitioned

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.080
and what have you but they both both of these ladies suggested a holiday dedicated to a day

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.240
of peace. Many individual states as I mentioned a moment ago celebrated Mother's Day by 1911 but it

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.560
was not until President Wilson lobbied Congress in 1914 that Mother's Day was officially set on

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.319
the second Sunday of every May. In his first Mother's Day proclamation Wilson stated that

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:12.239
the holiday offered an opportunity to publicly express our love and reverence for the mothers

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.080
of our country and I'm thankful that we have this date on our calendar and there was a joke going

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.559
around about whether or not you know the the mothers have a Mother's Day fathers have Father's

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:30.639
Day but what about Kids Day and so that's just every day and but the the reality is that I'm

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:36.239
thankful that on our calendar that every year we have Mother's Day and I sent a note to my mom this

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:41.040
morning it's the first year in a number of years that she's not been in our presence. In fact I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.919
was sharing with Holly and the kids last night that last year on Mother's Day both my mom and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.879
Holly's mom were in attendance for Mother's Day service they were both in town and so we certainly

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.000
appreciate that opportunity so I sent both of them text messages this morning and I hope that if your

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.239
mom is still living that you have sought to make it a special day for her. Many of us are familiar

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:07.360
with this passage of scripture here in Proverbs chapter 31 the content of this passage and the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.039
virtuous woman verse one however of this familiar chapter provides us with some very important

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:21.759
information notice in Proverbs 31 and verse number one the Bible says this the words of King

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:31.039
Lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him that his mother taught him I've titled the message

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:37.759
this morning his mother taught him think about the words of this single verse of scripture and

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.520
the significance of it in fact there's been much debate over the centuries as to who this King

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.399
Lemuel actually is and we don't have any other reference with any of the kings or chronicles

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:56.960
that would provide us with a name of King Lemuel and so through the series of debate

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:05.759
over the centuries there have been a number of people that have suggested that Lemuel was a name

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:12.559
for Solomon that Bathsheba used specifically for him whether that's the case or not the Bible

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:20.800
doesn't tell us but we do know that the name Lemuel means for God or belonging to God and it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.919
would be as you look at the text of scripture and understand all that's giving all the instruction

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:32.479
that's that's provided here it could possibly be that it's Bathsheba who is the mother of Solomon

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:38.960
that she had for her son this name Lemuel whether that's the case or not it's not really to be

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.720
debated we find that the text does tell us however that this prophecy that is recorded in

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.880
this portion of scripture it is the prophecy that his mother taught him we're going to think about

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.320
this prophecy and thinking about that which is provided here I would simply say that this which

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.679
his mother taught him there's instruction that is being given begin to think about instruction it

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:08.559
continues and notice in verse 2 what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:16.799
vows give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings it is not

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:24.000
for kings oh Lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink lest they drink

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.600
and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted give strong drink unto him that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.679
is ready to perish or die and wine unto those that be of a heavy heart let him drink and forget

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:41.760
his poverty and remember his misery no more open thy mouth for the dumb and the cause of all such

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.839
as are appointed to destruction open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:56.959
and needy in verse number 10 the bible says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.799
above rubies and as you continue through the next several verses you'll find that there's much

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:08.559
information given with regard to the virtuous woman and maybe we would say a description

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.000
of that virtuous woman but i'm going to think about this text of scripture this morning

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.760
and as i was meditating and preparing throughout the week that statement in verse number one really

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.519
caught my attention that his mother taught him if you're taking notes this morning i want you to

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:32.880
consider first of all with me i want you to note the vision of the instructor the vision of the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.959
instructor now we're not speaking about their physical vision but i begin to think about here

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:45.679
in our text of scripture we understand that the instructor is the mother of this king lemuel the

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:52.320
bible says very clearly that his mother taught him she's instructing her son and we find that

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.239
she's providing counsel instruction with regard to life this morning we acknowledge however the

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:07.359
reality that many can carry the title of instructor within the text of scripture we find that it's the

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:13.040
mother of king lemuel but the reality is that there are many today that carry the title of

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.359
instructor in fact many times as we go through life perhaps we would even have for a period of

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:25.760
time maybe for a long period of time that title ascribed to us that we are an instructor that we

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.000
are one that is giving information seeking to equip others begin to think about an instructor

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.040
and thinking about the vision of an instructor and thinking here of this text of scripture and

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.359
the vision of the mother of king lemuel and begin to think about an instructor i would say this an

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:50.720
instructor has a desire to impart truth an instructor has a desire to impart truth

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.959
begin to think about the vision of an instructor and noticing here in the text of scripture how

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:05.200
that the mother of this king lemuel she desires to impart truth to her son an instructor should

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.760
have that desire if they don't have a desire to impart truth they shouldn't be an instructor they

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.480
have no business being in that line of work but we find that truth is vital truth is absolutely

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.959
vital as we get to think about the instruction that is provided here and we know this is the

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:26.720
word of god and we understand this morning that god said uh the lord jesus christ in john 17

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:35.119
sanctify them through thy word thy word is truth jesus said of himself i am the way the truth

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:41.920
and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me i am thankful this morning for truth

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.239
you understand this morning that truth is under attack you understand this morning that it seems

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:52.079
as if there are people within our society uh that are seeking to influence the next generation and

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.040
in fact if we'd be honest this morning they're having a measure of success on influencing the

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.079
next generation and they have this idea that truth is relative it can be your truth or

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:07.519
my truth or their truth but the reality this morning is that we are thankful that we have

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:13.920
god's truth and god has given us truth this morning i begin to think about an instructor

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.359
and their desire to impart truth and we see that here uh in the the instruction of proverbs chapter

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:26.320
31 i would say this an instructor not only has a desire to impart truth but i would say this an

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:36.080
instructor seeks to equip for the future an instructor seeks to equip for the future i think

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.760
about this passage of scripture and as you begin to study through proverbs chapter 31 it would seem

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.400
as if lemuel was receiving this instruction at a young age he was being taught things that would

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.599
be pertinent to his future things that may not be applied immediately in his life but the vision of

00:08:55.599 --> 00:09:02.159
the instructor is that they know they're aware of some things that are going to happen in the future

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:07.440
with regard to life and living and circumstances and so on and so forth and so what is the

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.919
instructor seeking to do well the instructor is seeking to equip the student for the future

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:17.679
you know it's interesting you think about instruction maybe some classes that you've

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.760
gone to and there are some classes that i've been to over the years and you kind of

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.520
at you know particular classes and what they might be you say i hope i really never have to use

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:36.239
this which i am being taught but we receive that instruction for the event that may come to pass

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:44.400
and we want to be equipped for that king lemuel uh is going to eventually as you look at the content

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.320
of verse 10 and following and you think about the virtuous woman and uh the the wife and the capable

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.320
wife if you will and you begin to look at that portion of scripture and you think how

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.760
uh the the mother of king lemuel is seeking to to equip her son

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:07.760
for a future decision, a decision that is so important in life, the person to whom you

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.320
will marry. Now we understand if it is the case that Lemuel is Solomon, he did not heed

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.280
much of the instruction that is provided or contained within this portion of Scripture,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.360
we'll save that for another time. But we find that as we think about the vision of

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.000
the instructor, they desire to impart truth, they seek to equip for the future, we find

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.880
here that the truth of the instructor here with regard to the vision of instructor, there

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:42.480
are cautions that are given regarding the dangers of life. This morning, we celebrate

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.800
Mother's Day, we think about instructors, and some, that which would qualify an instructor

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.640
is sometimes the experience that they've had in life. And as they have experienced life,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.920
I think about parenthood, I remember saying to Juliana on more than one occasion, I was

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.680
16 before, so I understand. I was this age before, so I understand. And there's certain

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.960
things that we understand. I use Juliana as the example because she's our oldest, and

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:16.080
I would say those things to her, and the reality is that God has given us an opportunity and

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.840
we then as instructors are seeking to provide caution regarding the dangers of life. You

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.160
know, it's quite heartbreaking for an instructor that has given a caution when they see the

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:36.280
student, that individual that they've instructed, not give heed to the caution. We can't make

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.720
them give heed to the caution, but when I think about the vision of the instructor that

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:49.920
the vision, there's caution that is provided. There are dangers in life, many of them. The

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.480
reality is you think about these young kids that just stood up here and sang and how precious

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.200
that was, there are some dangers that they're going to face in life, and they need some

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.600
moms that are going to instruct them, that are going to teach them, that are going to

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:11.320
warn them, caution them with regard to those dangers. You think about signs in life and

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:19.200
you think about those signs that say warning, caution, danger ahead. I read a report just

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.920
the other day that some tourist was traveling. I did not catch where they were traveling,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.040
but they were following the GPS and they turned directly into a boat ramp marina and ended

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.240
up with their van, their minivan in the water. How many of you saw that in the news? The

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.280
reality is that you follow the GPS, but you've got to have a little sense as well. The reality

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.080
is that literally people are jumping in the water to try to help them get out and the

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.000
van's just kind of floating and that's, I don't know what you tell your insurance at

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.120
that point, but I was following the GPS. And the reality is that in life there's dangers.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.920
There's danger. And as an instructor with vision, we seek to give caution regarding

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:12.560
the dangers of life. We find that there are dangers, no doubt the book of Proverbs particularly

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.400
speaks often about the strange woman. And we find that those, those warnings are provided

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.600
and you see some instruction that's provided even here. You see the warning that is given

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:29.880
with regard to alcoholic beverage there in verses 4 and 5 to King Lemuel. And we find

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:37.000
that the warning is being provided, the caution about the dangers of life. I would say that

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.360
the instructor not only gives caution regarding the dangers of life, but the instructor gives

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:51.360
counsel regarding the decisions in life. You know decisions, we make decisions every day.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.520
We really do. Every day we make decisions. Some decisions are harder than other decisions.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.800
Would you agree this morning? And there are decisions that we make in life and especially

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.900
when you think about young people and you think about being the role of an instructor

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.020
and hear the vision of the instructor, the vision of the instructor is to know, to have

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.500
an awareness that there are decisions in life that these individuals need to make and I'm

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:23.140
seeking to provide them counsel with regard to those decisions. The Bible speaks much

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:30.520
about counsel and the importance of receiving counsel, that there's safety in the multitude

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.720
of counselors is what God's Word says. And we find this morning that the instructor,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.520
the vision of the instructor is to see beyond the immediate and to seek to impart truth

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.960
and to equip for the future, to provide caution with regard to the dangers of life, to provide

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:56.320
counsel with regard to the decisions in life. There are times that I've heard people say,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.040
what I do to be 18 again? And I kind of scratch my head and I'm like, do you remember how

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.160
hard it was when you were 18 trying to make all those decisions? I mean, there's a lot

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.279
of stuff that you're trying to process and go through and some people might make that

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:14.720
statement because they say, well, I'm wiser now and maybe I'd choose different things

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.960
and whatever the case may be for someone making that statement, the reality is that not one

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:26.880
of us can go back and redo it. But you know what we can do? Is we can give counsel to

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.600
those that God would enable us to be instructors to, and we can give them counsel with regard

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.040
to the decisions in life. I won't ask you to raise your hand this morning, but I think

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.880
each of us, if we're honest, we would, but there have been some times in our lives that

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:49.880
we made some bad decisions. We made some foolish decisions. And we said, man, what was I thinking

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.040
and then maybe we say, I wasn't thinking and that's why I made that decision. And we make

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.960
some bad decisions. And so what do we do with that? Well, we should learn from that, but

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.920
then we also are able to equip others and to help them understand, listen, there's some

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.279
decisions that you're going to face in life. One of the goals that Holly and I have had

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:15.680
with raising our children is to seek to equip them for life. Listen, I don't want to take

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.160
care of my kids for life. Hallelujah. I don't. I don't want to have to pay their bills. I

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.600
don't want to take care. No, I want to raise them and I want to have them equipped for

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.800
life. It doesn't mean that they might not fall on hard times and they might need some

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.960
assistance, a phone call or this or that, whatever. But the reality is that the goal

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.619
of an instructor is to say, hey, I want to give you, I want to impart to you that which

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:47.700
you would need for life. The vision of the instructor. Let me note this. Not only the

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.779
vision of the instructor, but I would say number two, I want you to note the value of

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:58.260
instruction. The value of instruction. We see the vision of the instructor, but then

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.480
we must note the value of instruction. We will not take the time to read the entirety

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.220
of Proverbs 31, but I would say to you that that which is contained within Proverbs 31

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.619
is valuable. Why? Because it's God's Word and all of God's Word is valuable and we find

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:19.180
that God's Word is to be cherished. God's Word is to be reverenced. God's Word is to

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.380
be obeyed and to be followed and we find this morning when we're speaking within the context

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:32.100
here of the instruction that has been provided, we must recognize and note the value of instruction.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:40.420
At times, I would say that it is unfortunate, but at times, we and others fail to recognize

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:47.700
the value of instruction, especially in the moment. In the moment when the instruction

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:54.059
is being provided, there are times in which we do not recognize the value of that instruction.

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:57.779
And then all of a sudden, there's something that happens in life and you say, you know,

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:01.740
I think I remember somebody talking about this before and maybe I wish I would have

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:06.940
paid more attention. I wish I would have been more attuned to what was going on and we may

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:12.820
be at the time the instruction is being provided, we did not recognize the value of instruction.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.740
But I would say that that's unfortunate and we must this morning, as those that would

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.559
receive instruction, not only those that would give instruction, but we all are recipients

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:28.300
of instruction in life, we must recognize the value. We mentioned this in the previous

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:35.700
point, but typically, the instructor has something that has qualified them to be in

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:41.820
that position of instructing and therefore, they would have value to give to those that

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:47.820
they're instructing. If I desire to learn something new, I've used this before, but

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.700
if I desire to learn something new that I've not done before and I'm going to seek out

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:58.020
an instructor for that particular discipline or that particular thing that I want to learn,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.580
I want to find somebody that is qualified to provide instruction. You might go through

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:09.979
a process, maybe an interview type process, and say, let me know, what are your qualifications

00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:15.859
for instructing me in this thing? And when they look at you and they can't give you anything

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:20.100
of substance, you say, well, I think I'm going to keep on looking for someone who is

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:26.359
more qualified. This morning, we think about the value of instruction and we understand

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:31.400
it and we use the context this morning of the instruction that God provides to us in

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.200
His Word. I'm so thankful this morning for God's Word and the instruction that is given.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.780
All scripture is given by inspiration of God. The Bible says that it's profitable not only

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:47.479
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. And verse

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:53.720
number 17 says that the man of God might be throughly furnished unto all good works. I'm

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.440
thankful for the instruction that God has given in His Word. When we begin to think

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.840
about the value of instruction...

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.940
this morning and I believe that if each of us would understand the value of

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:10.760
instruction we would respond in a different manner. How many of you ever

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.740
had you're trying to give instruction to your children maybe you just pause and

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.180
say are you listening to me? That ever happen to you? Maybe you're instructing

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.780
in some other context and you you are giving some level of instruction and you

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.220
say you guys aren't listening to me are you? I remember my dad when he was

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.180
teaching when I was in high school he was teaching our teen class in our

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.380
church in Nevada and he's a Marine and so you got to kind of take that into

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.540
context of what's going on there and he was active duty at the time and he

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.900
constantly was dealing with Marines and certain things he he was he was in the

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.900
Marine Corps in a different era I'll put it that way and so my dad had the idea

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.100
that when he was instructing if you weren't paying attention he just throw

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.100
stuff at you I mean honestly and so what was it that he would throw well

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.860
he'd have a dry erase board that he was writing on and so dry erase markers

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.620
would fly in the classroom often it would why because you're not paying

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:13.580
attention but if we understand this morning the value of instruction then

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.140
we'll respond in a certain way let me give you a few thoughts from the book of

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.540
Proverbs here we'll look at a couple other chapter or other portions of

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.100
scripture as well but I want you to think about our response to instruction

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.180
when we know the value of instruction will respond notice in Proverbs 4 and

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.060
verse number 1 the first way that will respond is that we will hear instruction

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.620
we'll hear instruction we'll have a desire to hear the instruction why

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:47.140
because we understand the value of instruction it's interesting today we're

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:55.220
living in a time unfortunately in our society where there is a just a shift in

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.060
the dynamics of the respect that a younger generation has for an older

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.940
generation I'm sure that you've witnessed that and you've seen that in

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:09.980
our society it used to be that a younger generation had a great level of respect

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.020
for an older generation because they recognize that there was something that

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:20.420
that older generation had to offer the next generation but in our society today

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:26.540
it seems as if there are many that have the idea that we really don't need the

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:33.140
older generation and that's unfortunate I am in a stage in my life where no

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.740
longer am I the youngest preacher when I go to a preacher's meeting for a number

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.900
of years I was always the youngest guy there and not so much the case anymore

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.140
and that's a good thing because there's some younger preachers that are out

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.660
there but the reality is that even in those early days and still to this day I

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.020
go to a preacher's fellowship and I want to talk to some older pastors and I want

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.620
to try to learn something from them they've experienced some things in their

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.900
ministries and in their lives and this past Tuesday I was at a pastor's meeting and some of the

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.380
guys and I talked to a bunch of people that were there and I went over and I

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.460
spoke to one pastor he's 80-something years old he just retired for the second

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:21.900
time and I want to try to get something from him and we think this morning of

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:27.660
this idea there's a value in instruction so I want to hear instruction what can I

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:33.100
how can I benefit from the instruction that is being provided notice in chapter

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.460
four and verse number one of the book of Proverbs it says hear ye children the

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:46.620
instruction of a father and attend to know understanding why why does he say

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.860
that will notice verse number two for I give you good doctrine forsaking not my

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:58.380
law we understand that Proverbs here as we think about the the book of Proverbs

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.420
in a whole and Solomon speaking to his son Rehoboam but we understand in a very

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.260
real sense that God is speaking to us as his children and he says to us here

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.700
here instruction God's instruction is good instruction it's valuable it is

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.220
profitable for us and when I understand and I know the value of instruction that

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.780
I want to hear it not only do I hear it but number two I'd say this I want to

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.620
receive it notice over in Proverbs chapter number 19 you know there's

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.260
something different between hearing and receiving would you agree with that this

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.300
morning there's something different between hearing and receiving I can hear

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.980
somebody but am I receiving the instruction I believe that the thought

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:45.220
of receiving instruction is not only the hearing of it but the applying of it

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:51.540
that I'm going to put into practice that which is being imparted again it's not

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.460
just you know are you listening to me yeah I'm hearing you no no no but you

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:00.180
you then watch the behavior you know the the decisions that are being made in

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.700
you're saying no no no you're not hearing me and really what's happening

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.940
is it's not that they're not hearing you they're not receiving it they're not

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:17.380
receiving it notice what the Bible says in Proverbs 19 and verse number 20 hear

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:27.340
counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.780
receive instruction you know as we think about this truth of receiving

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.620
instruction it's sad that there are many times that instruction is not received

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.580
it's not that instruction is not given it's that instruction is not received

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.900
now there's a problem when instruction is not given and again that's for

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.180
another conversation but this morning when instruction is being given when we

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.980
know in Proverbs 31 the truth that his mother taught him instruction actively

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.580
was being given was being provided the D the the the importance is that that

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:06.460
instruction is being received there are times in which instruction is rejected

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:12.660
despised listen to this indictment you don't need to turn there I'll read it

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:19.580
for you but in Jeremiah 32 and in verse number 33 God gives an indictment to

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:27.460
Judah with regard to their response the receiving of instruction by the way God

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.380
was faithful to give the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.780
instruction God was gracious and long-suffering and he kept raising up

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.540
prophets and sending prophets to deliver the message of God from God to his

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.060
people but we know that in Jeremiah 32 in verse number 33 the Bible says of

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:52.340
them and they have turned unto me the back and not the face can you see the

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.500
imagery I mean if you're talking to someone you want them to look at you you

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.140
want them to face you can you imagine if you're giving instruction to somebody

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:07.300
and they turn their back on you that's just rude and God says and they have

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:16.060
turned into the back and not the face though I taught them rising up early and

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:26.340
teaching them yet they have not harkened to receive instruction I would

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.780
submit to you that that's frustrating as an instructor is it not you're trying to

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.500
give instruction you're trying to teach you're trying to impart truth you're

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.420
trying to equip for the future you're aware of the fact that there are some

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.260
cautions that you want to give because there are dangers in life you're aware

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.340
of the fact that you want to give some counsel because there are some decisions

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:53.060
in life and yet they're not taking heed this morning I believe that when we

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.820
understand the value of instruction that not only will we hear instruction but we

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:05.220
will receive instruction we'll receive that which is being imparted and then I

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.620
would say this and I love the the the verse of Scripture the way it says look

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.300
over at Proverbs chapter number 12 and verse number 1 I would say that we then

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.060
as I hear instruction and receive instruction I'm going to love instruction

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:25.780
love instruction in Proverbs chapter number 12 in verse number 1 the Bible

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:32.020
speaks about this subject of instruction and it says whoso loveth instruction

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:39.059
loveth knowledge but he that hateth reproof is brutish I think about that

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:43.460
first statement of Proverbs 12 and verse number 1 whoso loveth instruction

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:50.180
loveth knowledge I desire to receive that instruction I understand the value

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.260
of instruction and so therefore I develop a love for instruction and I

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.580
would submit to you that this is really kind of a cycle if you will then as I

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.580
love instruction then I'm going to hear it and I'm gonna receive it and then my

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.820
love for instruction is going to increase and therefore I'm going to hear

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.860
it and I'm going to receive it and I'm gonna love it more why because I

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:21.380
understand the value of it God's Word is full of valuable instruction and I

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.500
would say this God's Word is full of valuable instruction for every aspect of

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.300
life God's Word has the answer we begin to think about the the the importance

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:40.020
this morning of recognizing the value of instruction so that I would respond

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:46.100
to that instruction by hearing it and receiving it and loving it that I would

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.020
apply it in my life that I would be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:59.180
how many times people have forsaken they have despised instruction they've

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.940
suffered

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.980
greatly for it. The Bible says the way of the transgressor is hard. You know, sometimes

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:16.220
it's challenging to watch a child, someone that you've sought to influence and counsel,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.100
you've sought to pour your life into to instruct them. Sometimes it's difficult to watch them

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:28.420
make decisions that are outside of the counsel, the instruction that you've provided. How

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.380
many times we'd like to go over and make the decision for them. But you know what you

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:38.960
find out in life? You can't really do that. You can't really do that. So what do we, when

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.780
we understand that truth this morning, we must recognize for most of us that are here

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.260
in the room this morning, we think about that first point of the message this morning, the

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.500
vision of the instructor, that we would seek to impart that truth, that we would pray for,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.820
that we would seek every opportunity that God would give us to be able to give that

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:08.660
instruction. Then when we're on the receiving end, that we'd hear it, we'd receive it, we'd

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.940
love it. I'm thankful that God would give us instruction. I'm thankful that God would

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.620
give us instructors in our lives. I hope this morning you can think of some people that

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.819
God has given you in your life to be an instructor, someone that seeks to impart truth, someone

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:32.860
that is faithful and diligent to invest in you. I was speaking with someone just this

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:40.779
past week and talked about some of my mentors. And I'm thankful for people that were willing

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:47.139
to invest in my life. I'm thankful that basically at any moment I can pick up the phone and

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:51.580
there's a few people that I can call and I can know that they're going to pick up the

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.580
phone and they're going to provide me with some instruction. Because there are times

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:03.380
in life that we need instruction, we need that counsel. And I'm thankful that God in

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.900
His grace and His mercy has not only given us individuals, but He's given us this complete

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:15.339
book. You know, how important it is that we face a situation in life, we say, God, would

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:20.380
you help me? Would you give me the instruction that I need? I don't, I hope that you recognize

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.699
in your life there are times that I just don't know what to do. God, I need some instruction.

00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:30.860
I need some direction. And God said that if we need wisdom, that if we ask Him, He promises

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:36.740
to give it. He told us that He's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.460
And so this morning as we think about Mother's Day and we think about this truth of Proverbs

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:46.860
chapter 31, and we think about the way in which the proverb begins, and again, most

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.619
of us this morning are familiar with much of the content, but we see in that very first

00:32:51.619 --> 00:32:59.619
verse that the Bible says that His mother taught Him. I wonder this morning, in closing,

00:32:59.619 --> 00:33:07.059
I wonder this morning, if we were to write out some things that our mother taught us,

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:16.220
what would they be? Let me ask it this way. What if we had our children write out some

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:23.240
things that they would say, here's what my mother taught me? We find within the context

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:31.540
of Proverbs 31 that the instructor is the mother, but as I said, many of us can have

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:38.419
that title as instructor. And so I wonder this morning, if we make it broader this morning,

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:42.619
if we'd say of those that God has given you the opportunity to have an influence in their

00:33:42.619 --> 00:33:50.900
lives, if they were given the task of sitting down and writing out what has this instructor,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:58.180
what have they taught you? What would the content be? Would there be anything of substance,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.460
of value? Would you be able to look at it and say, man, I didn't even realize I was

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:09.979
teaching all those lessons. I'm so thankful they were getting that. They were grasping

00:34:09.979 --> 00:34:17.139
that which I was seeking to impart to them. This morning, we see the vision of the instructor.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:24.580
I hope this morning, I know our kids are, Holly and I, our children are getting older,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:31.660
16, 18, 20. I mean, many of you have children that are older than that. But I understand

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.820
that sometimes when they're, you know, this big and it's just busy and so many things

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:47.299
and we can just get overwhelmed, when is this stage going to be over? It's hard. Have vision

00:34:47.299 --> 00:34:54.580
to know that you're instructing them. You're seeking to impart and to equip, to caution

00:34:54.580 --> 00:35:00.500
and to counsel. Why? Because by God's grace, they're going to grow up. They're going to

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:06.940
face a lot of things in life and they need your instruction. Have some vision about your

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:12.619
instruction. And then for all of us this morning, I hope that we'd understand the value of instruction.

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:18.899
I say, man, I want to hear it and receive it and love it and just continue in that cycle

00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:26.779
because I understand that God has given me instruction and it is good for me. It is valuable.

00:35:26.779 --> 00:35:33.019
I never want to be in a place where it's said of Judah there in the book of Jeremiah that

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:41.059
they hearken not to receive instruction. I don't want to be in that place. God's given

00:35:41.059 --> 00:35:46.140
us his word. This morning, we must receive the instruction. Let's pray together. Father,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.459
we love you. We thank you so much for loving us. We thank you for the privilege of being

00:35:50.459 --> 00:35:56.179
able to gather together this morning. We thank you for your word. We thank you for the truth

00:35:56.179 --> 00:36:01.459
of your word. We thank you for this day, Mother's Day. As we think about this truth in Proverbs

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:09.459
31, what great content is provided to us there in that portion of scripture as we just focus

00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:14.420
primarily in the beginning portion to think about the vision of the instructor, the value

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:21.179
of instruction. God, I pray this morning that you would help us. I pray that you would work

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:25.580
in hearts and lives as only you can. Help us to have a vision for those that you've

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:31.559
given us the opportunity to instruct and help us to have the proper value placed upon the

00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:37.459
instruction that we'd receive. Help us, Lord. I pray that in this few moments of invitation,

00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:42.019
before we have the baby dedication, Lord, I pray that you would move and work in hearts

00:36:42.019 --> 00:36:46.500
and lives as only you can. I pray that in these few moments of invitation that decisions

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.739
would be made that would please thee. Maybe there's some that this morning, if they'd

00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:55.860
be honest, they've not received instruction. Maybe they've hardened their heart. Maybe

00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:02.100
they've resisted, despised instruction. Oh, God, I pray that you'd help them to get that

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:11.019
right. I pray that we would love instruction, hear it and receive it, apply it in our lives.

00:37:11.019 --> 00:37:14.339
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:17.940
you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.619
the piano.
