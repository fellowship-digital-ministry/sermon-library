1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,539
We're going to begin, however, in the book of Amos and Old Testament prophet, Hosea Joel

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:11,500
Amos, and try to help you out there, Amos chapter 3.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,340
And we'll give you just a moment to turn there, and I'll read to you the question that was

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,579
submitted for our message this evening.

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,540
As many of you know, throughout the summer, and I know we're past the summer at this point,

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,219
we have, on Sunday evenings, had a Ask the Pastor series.

7
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:35,139
And we gave you opportunity to submit questions and ask the pastor, and those questions have

8
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:40,659
become a series that I've answered and try to answer these questions biblically and give

9
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,259
you the truth of the Word of God.

10
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:49,020
And this series, I was just mapping it out yesterday in my office, and it's probably

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,020
going to take me until January to finish.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,840
And so, our summer series is going to go straight through the fall into the winter.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,259
But that's okay, and I'm thankful for the questions.

14
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,599
I've often learned this over the years, that when someone has a question, it probably means

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,940
that someone else has a similar question.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,180
And so, it's been a real good opportunity.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,800
We did this several years ago, and thankful for the opportunity to do it again.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,739
But the question that was provided that we're looking at this evening actually had a disclaimer

19
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,819
put on the question, and I thought that was kind of interesting.

20
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:27,620
The disclaimer was this, this is not an antagonistic question.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,519
And that's always encouraging when you see those words to begin the question.

22
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,379
And the question reads this.

23
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,919
It's a lengthy question, so I'll read the entirety of it.

24
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:42,540
It says this, why are independent Baptist churches, that's what we are, reluctant to

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,199
affiliate with other denominations when it comes to missions work?

26
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:52,739
The example that is given is missionaries will often say there are only X number of

27
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,639
independent Baptist churches in a particular area, the field in which they're going to

28
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,760
minister.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,279
And then the question ends this way, do other denominations really not preach the gospel?

30
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:10,339
And so, this evening, as we begin to look at this particular question that was submitted,

31
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:15,039
really I have a few immediate thoughts with regard to this question that are actually

32
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:21,880
more questions in themselves of responding to that question, and just a few thoughts.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,080
Number one would be this, why don't we affiliate with other denominations here?

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,320
Talking about the missions field and the reluctance of missionaries to affiliate or partner with

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,160
other denominations of people that are there, well, why don't we do it here?

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
And I'll answer that as we get through the message this evening.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,399
But then let me ask this question, what distinguishes one denomination from another?

38
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,880
In other words, why do we call ourselves Baptist?

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,919
What's in a name?

40
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,360
Does a name matter?

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,839
I think a name does matter.

42
00:02:54,839 --> 00:03:01,520
I think it's extremely important when we say and we identify as being Baptist people, historically

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,119
that means something, and I'm thankful for what it means, and we understand.

44
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:11,720
And listen, there's a number of Baptist churches that have not stood for what Baptists have

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,419
historically stood for, there's a slide that is taking place, but the reality is that historically

46
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:21,880
when someone would say I'm a Baptist, there's a number of things that you immediately begin

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,000
to understand about what that means.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,080
Of course, we would say this, that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,940
Now that in of itself sets us apart from a lot of denominations.

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,419
And so the question about affiliation, really, we would ask ourselves what distinguishes

51
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,979
one denomination from another?

52
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:44,380
Is there really significance in a name?

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,740
I would say yes, it matters.

54
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,320
Let me share this thought with you.

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:04:00,179
What biblical teaching would we be willing to abandon in order to accomplish some goal?

56
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:08,300
Whatever that goal is, the goal of ecumenical partnership, the goal of this affiliation,

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,179
what teaching of the Bible would we be willing to abandon to set aside for the purpose of

58
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:18,660
trying to accomplish some goal?

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,619
I hope that we'd say none, amen?

60
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:25,040
Because the Bible is the sole authority for faith and practice.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,480
And so we cannot say, well, that doesn't really matter.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,640
Or for the sake of unity, no, there is no unity apart from God.

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,920
There's no unity apart from this book.

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,920
And if we're going to have unity, it's because we're going to agree with God, not because

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,679
we're going to try to agree with each other apart from God.

66
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:51,200
Then I had this thought, how much is enough to agree on?

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Where do we kind of draw that line?

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,260
Where does it say, well, that's enough?

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,940
Is there enough in common that we can partner with and we can affiliate with?

70
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,420
And those are just some immediate thoughts and questions.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,619
And really, the subject that is before us this evening is of significant importance.

72
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,619
It is absolutely worthy of our study.

73
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:14,720
I believe that when we could define the question this evening, that really what we're dealing

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
with is ecumenical separation.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,220
We're dealing with the subject of ecumenical separation.

76
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,700
I've titled the message this evening there from Amos 3.

77
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,140
I used the entire verse as our title this evening.

78
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,420
Verse number 3, can two walk together except they be agreed?

79
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,660
We begin to think about this subject of ecumenical separation, begin to think about this affiliation

80
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,540
that's being referenced, and missionaries mentioning that there's only, I think when

81
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,579
Brother Thomas was here, he mentioned there were six or seven independent Baptist missionaries

82
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,859
in all of Guatemala.

83
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,260
And you begin to understand, as we would make those distinctions, in fact, I've even spoken

84
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,220
about the number of independent Baptist churches in Fairfax County, in Northern Virginia, and

85
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,619
we begin to understand those churches that are standing on that same faith that we would

86
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,859
hold dear and that we'd understand.

87
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:15,540
Let me say this when we speak about ecumenical separation, it is important for us to note

88
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,500
that the New Testament, and we'll look at a number of verses this evening in the New

89
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Testament, that the New Testament does not define essential and non-essential doctrine.

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,339
There's no distinguishing in the New Testament between this being an essential doctrine and

91
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,779
this being a non-essential doctrine.

92
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,820
Now I understand that oftentimes we will speak about the fundamentals of the faith and we'll

93
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:48,220
speak about these essential doctrines, but you understand that this is more of our identifying

94
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,459
the particular doctrines and us classifying the teaching of the Word of God.

95
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:56,940
We do not see this distinction within the Bible.

96
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,859
Let me show you a few verses of Scripture.

97
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:03,040
Notice in the book of Philippians, if you will, and I want you to see as God is giving

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,040
us the truth in the New Testament with regard to the body of doctrine, the faith that was

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,260
delivered to us, I want you to see what Paul is saying here in the book of Philippians

100
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,619
as he's writing to a local church, the church in Philippi, and he comes to the conclusion,

101
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:22,940
he's in Philippians 4, and notice in verse number 9, I want you to notice how he says

102
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,700
this under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, those things which you have

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:37,100
both learned and received and heard and seen in me do, and the God of peace shall be with

104
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
you.

105
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,420
Now, he summarizes everything that he taught them with those things, right?

106
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,459
That's how he summarizes the body of doctrine that he taught the believers in Philippi,

107
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,220
all of the teaching that he gave.

108
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,179
He says those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do.

109
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,519
There's no real exception in that verse of Scripture, and we find that as he's talking

110
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,179
to Timothy, turn to the book of 2 Timothy chapter number 1, and I want you to see what

111
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,420
he says here to Timothy.

112
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,459
There's a whole host of verses that we could look at.

113
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,859
I'm just picking a few so that we can get through the message this evening, and I want

114
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:20,859
you to see how that the Word of God references the body of doctrine, the faith, if you will,

115
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:26,420
that we hold dear, and the importance of the fact that the New Testament does not make

116
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,220
a distinction or define between essential and non-essential.

117
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,960
Notice in 2 Timothy 1 and verse number 13, notice where he says, hold fast the form of

118
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,960
sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,880
So we find that he refers here, as he's speaking to Timothy, this teaching, this doctrine as

120
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,679
sound words.

121
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,200
If you read the book of Titus, and we won't take time to look at the book of Titus this

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,039
evening, but if you look at the book of Titus, you'll see that Titus is given the instruction

123
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,580
to go and to ordain leadership there, and we find that he's given the responsibility

124
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,320
on a number of occasion with regard to sound doctrine.

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,760
Sound doctrine.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,039
Jude has only one chapter, but I want you to see the significance of what we find in

127
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,520
Jude as he's writing here, and he gives us, it's amazing as you begin to look at the introduction

128
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,440
here as to what Jude is dealing with, and it's interesting where it says in verse number

129
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,359
three of Jude, he says, Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common

130
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:43,359
salvation, then notice where he says, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort

131
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:50,760
you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
saints.

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,840
So now here in the book of Jude, how does Jude refer to doctrine or the body of doctrine?

134
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,479
He refers to it as the faith.

135
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:04,479
Things, sound words, the faith.

136
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,239
And we find that it's inclusive of all the teaching.

137
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:13,359
And we find here that Jude says it was needful for me to write, and not only to write but

138
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:18,759
to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto

139
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,759
the saints.

140
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,279
So we have a faith which is worth contending for.

141
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,359
Amen?

142
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,899
Do you believe that this evening?

143
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,739
When we think about doctrine, listen, doctrine matters.

144
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:31,739
Doctrine is important.

145
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,979
And we begin to think about doctrine this evening, and we understand the importance

146
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:36,979
of doctrine.

147
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:44,179
I'm thankful that we have a doctrine that is worth fighting for, contending for, standing

148
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,779
on the truth of the Word of God.

149
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,379
It's not my doctrine.

150
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:53,059
It's not some religious organization, some denomination's doctrine.

151
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,299
It's Bible doctrine.

152
00:10:55,299 --> 00:11:02,659
And we must understand and make that distinction that what God says settles it.

153
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,659
Just settles it.

154
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:06,699
I said this on Wednesday evening, and then on Thursday evening I heard another preacher

155
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,299
say it, and he's about 40 years older than I am, not quite, maybe 35 years older than

156
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:12,299
I am.

157
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,179
And I said to Holly, I was like, I like what he said.

158
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,619
I said the same thing on Wednesday evening, and here's what it is.

159
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,619
Listen, I didn't write the Bible, I'm just telling you what it says.

160
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:25,659
If you've got a problem with it, you've got a problem with God, right?

161
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,979
And we can rejoice in that in saying, here's what God said.

162
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,179
And so we find that there's no distinction.

163
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,739
Let me show you, however, what the Bible says with regard to those that would teach some

164
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,859
other doctrine.

165
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,779
Turn back to the book of Romans, if you will.

166
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,659
In the 16th chapter, I told you that we'd be in a number of passages, and I want to

167
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:50,299
give you some things to think about this evening with regard to the subject of ecumenical separation

168
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:56,819
and why it is that we would not partner with, affiliate with people that do not hold the

169
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:02,099
same teaching or doctrine that we do, and then give you some thoughts with regard to

170
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,099
that.

171
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:10,699
In Romans chapter number 16, in verses 17 and 18, notice what the Bible says.

172
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:18,619
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to what?

173
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:26,319
To the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.

174
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,299
So in verse number 17, we're given two instructions.

175
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,899
One is to mark them, and two is to avoid them.

176
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,859
That's pretty strong language.

177
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,219
Mark them and avoid them.

178
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:45,019
Notice in verse number 18, for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but

179
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:51,499
their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

180
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:58,219
Listen, if I'm going to mark someone that has false doctrine, it must mean that I have

181
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:01,459
to know Bible doctrine.

182
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:06,219
I can't mark someone that's teaching someone that's false or something that is false.

183
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:11,379
I can't avoid someone that's teaching something that's false if I don't know the truth.

184
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,659
That's why it's so important that we have a good handle on the Word of God.

185
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:18,379
That's why it's so important that we study to show ourselves approved unto God, a workman

186
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,459
that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth.

187
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:27,499
And we find that here, the instruction, notice what Paul says, now I beseech you.

188
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:31,899
I mean, we look at this word and we speak about the significance.

189
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,419
Paul's saying, I'm begging you, don't mingle, don't mix.

190
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:43,019
Mark those that are not teaching sound doctrine that cause divisions and offenses that are

191
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,099
contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them.

192
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:57,459
Notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 3, 2 Thessalonians chapter number 3, and notice

193
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:07,859
in verse number 14, this is very interesting because it's speaking about those that aren't

194
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:14,299
obeying even the words of the epistle that is written to a local church.

195
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:18,779
And if you look contextually, he's dealing with those that would not work and also with

196
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,579
those that are busybodies.

197
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,099
And he says this in verse number 14, and if any man obey not our word by this epistle,

198
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:29,099
note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed.

199
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,979
Wow.

200
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:34,579
Note them and have no company with them.

201
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,019
Notice in 1 Timothy chapter number 6, just a few pages over, in 1 Timothy chapter number

202
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:51,299
6, in verses 3 through 5, in 1 Timothy 6 and verses 3 through 5, the Bible says this beginning

203
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:58,099
in verse number 3, if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the

204
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:02,579
words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.

205
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,739
And so we find what Paul is referring to as being what we referenced earlier, those

206
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,619
things, sound words, the faith, as Jude refers to it.

207
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:16,379
He says if someone's teaching contrary to that, otherwise, he notes it in verse number

208
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,059
4, he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof

209
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,719
cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds

210
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,779
and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness.

211
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:37,099
Notice what he says at the end, from such withdraw thyself.

212
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,739
From such withdraw thyself.

213
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:46,199
It doesn't say find what's common between you and them and just embrace those common

214
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,739
things for the cause of X.

215
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:54,739
No, no, he says from such withdraw thyself.

216
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:58,999
Notice in the book of Titus in chapter number 3, I mentioned already that Titus had the

217
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,259
responsibility of being given the commission.

218
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:06,319
In fact, Paul says that he left him in Crete for this purpose, that he would set in order

219
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,319
things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city that I had appointed thee.

220
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,019
He gives them the truth of those that are…the sound doctrine.

221
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,319
He mentions it three times within about 12 verses.

222
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,239
And we find as we come to chapter number 3, in verse number 9, the Bible says, but avoid

223
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:27,519
foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law, for they are

224
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,199
unprofitable in vain, for they are unprofitable in vain.

225
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:38,199
A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition, what does it say?

226
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,199
Reject.

227
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,919
The word heretic is a follower of a false doctrine, that's what it means.

228
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,499
We use the word heresy.

229
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:52,959
You understand we've used the word apostasy or apostate, and you notice that many that

230
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,639
are today of these, if you quote-unquote call them mainline denominations, that there's…they

231
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,139
are apostate.

232
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:06,279
They are heretical in their teaching, following false teaching, false doctrine.

233
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,719
The issue facing the believers in the churches throughout the region of Galatia is addressed

234
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:12,719
in the book of Galatians.

235
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:17,599
I don't have time to look at the entirety of the book of Galatians this evening, but

236
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,639
as you study the book of Galatians, you will find that Paul is addressing head-on this

237
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:28,839
problem that is facing these churches in the region of Galatia, these churches that were

238
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,219
established during that first missionary journey.

239
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:36,199
And there were some false teachers, they were called Judaizers, and these Judaizers were

240
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:42,159
coming in and they were teaching that works are necessary to be saved.

241
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:46,159
And here's what the Bible says in Acts chapter 15, we're going to look at Galatians 1, but

242
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,879
let me tell you what Acts 15 says with regard to really the situation in the region of Galatia.

243
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:57,719
The council, if you will, in Jerusalem in Acts 15 is in reference to what's happening

244
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,159
in Galatia.

245
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,439
And as we follow the chronological understanding of the book of Acts and what's happening with

246
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,759
regard to the other churches and the other regions, you find that this council that's

247
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,799
called in Jerusalem, that's referenced and recorded for us in Acts 15, has everything

248
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,159
to do with what Paul is writing in the book of Galatians to these churches in the region

249
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,319
of Galatia.

250
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,199
And it is with regard to the Judaizers, and here's what the Judaizers were saying.

251
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,999
It's spelled out for us in Acts 15 in verse number 1,

252
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:33,639
And certain men which came down from Judea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be

253
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:41,359
circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

254
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,079
Paul says, I have a problem with that, because salvation is by grace through faith.

255
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,079
Grace alone.

256
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,079
Amen?

257
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,079
It's not grace plus law.

258
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,599
It's not in you have to be circumcised, no, no, no.

259
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,599
And so this drew sharp contention.

260
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,320
There's a great council that takes place in Jerusalem.

261
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,000
If you read the entirety of Acts 15, you see the discussion that takes place, and I'm thankful

262
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,719
that in verse number 11, it says, We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,

263
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:12,639
we shall be saved even as they, glory, hallelujah, they got it right.

264
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:17,919
They understood the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of course, the apostles, they're

265
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,119
giving that truth.

266
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,279
But I want you to see what Paul says in the book of Galatians in chapter number 1.

267
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,199
I want it to reference that Acts 15 so that we could understand contextually what's happening.

268
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:34,279
And notice the language that Paul uses in Galatians 1.

269
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,479
It is strong language.

270
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:42,479
In verse number 6, he says, I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called

271
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:48,919
you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another, but there be

272
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,239
some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

273
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:57,599
But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, then that which

274
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,199
we have preached unto you...

275
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:03,959
let him be accursed."

276
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,039
Let him be accursed.

277
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,119
Notice in v. 9,

278
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,159
as we said before,

279
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,419
"...so say I now again,

280
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,459
if any man preach any other gospel unto you

281
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,879
than that ye have received,

282
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,799
let him be accursed.

283
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,759
For do I now persuade men, or God,

284
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,559
or do I seek to please men?

285
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,679
For if I yet please men,

286
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,759
I should not be the servant of Christ."

287
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,259
Paul's not trying to be a man pleaser.

288
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,939
Paul says, I know, in fact,

289
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:27,979
in v. 11 he says,

290
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,319
I certify you, brethren,

291
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,319
that the gospel which was preached of me

292
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,219
is not after man.

293
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,719
For I neither received it of man,

294
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,919
neither was I taught it,

295
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,639
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

296
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,519
He says I'm not trying to please men.

297
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,839
I'm not trying to make friends, so to speak.

298
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,759
I'm trying to please God.

299
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,059
And so therefore, if these Judaizers

300
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,119
are coming in and they're teaching

301
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,619
contrary to what I've delivered unto you,

302
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,539
let him be accursed.

303
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,479
That's a strong language.

304
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,939
So we begin to think about the New Testament

305
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,659
and the teaching that is laid out

306
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,679
with regard to the sound words.

307
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,199
Those things.

308
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,419
The faith.

309
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,239
Sound doctrine that is mentioned

310
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,399
multiple times in the book of Titus.

311
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,659
We see what the Bible says in the New Testament

312
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,279
about those that would teach something that's contrary.

313
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,579
And now I ask the question again,

314
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,479
what is it that we'd be willing

315
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,419
to set aside or to abandon

316
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,379
in order to accomplish something?

317
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:32,859
What part of our Bible would we be okay

318
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,899
with just cutting out and setting aside

319
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,419
and saying no, I don't need that?

320
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,619
And you say, well, that kind of brings it to another level.

321
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,579
I understand.

322
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:41,579
And that's really what we've got to do in our mind

323
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,059
is we just kind of tear a page out

324
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,179
and say okay, I don't like that.

325
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,379
I'm going to get rid of it.

326
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,739
Well, we would never do that.

327
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,379
I hope not anyway.

328
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,259
Right?

329
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,499
We're not going to take portions of God's Word

330
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,899
and just tear them out and say nope, we don't need that.

331
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:58,239
We're not going to take a black Sharpie marker

332
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:01,639
and just mark through portions of verses of Scripture

333
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:04,919
so that we can have some level of affiliation

334
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,919
with some other group of people, some other denomination.

335
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,259
No, doctrine matters.

336
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,419
And so as we begin to consider the subject,

337
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:15,839
I just have several things, and again,

338
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,199
I'm not going to teach through all of this this evening.

339
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,799
I hope that it's enough to give us an answer

340
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,299
to help us have some direction for our own lives

341
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,939
with regard to studying and understanding

342
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,459
and being able to draw that line

343
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:32,319
as to where we would have fellowship or cooperation.

344
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,259
Obviously, we think about theology or the teaching,

345
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:38,299
the doctrine of God, the deity of Christ.

346
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,419
Listen, there is no room for movement

347
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,619
with regard to the deity of Christ.

348
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,099
Amen?

349
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:49,579
So many, so many have gotten it wrong

350
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:51,919
on the person of Jesus Christ.

351
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
And listen, if you get it wrong with Jesus,

352
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,399
you get it wrong.

353
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:58,359
It's just wrong, amen?

354
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,239
We've studied through the book of 1 John

355
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,519
here on Sunday mornings throughout this year,

356
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,879
and as you go to the fourth chapter,

357
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,079
you understand he talks about trying the spirits.

358
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,879
And we understand the importance

359
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,799
of being able to identify,

360
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,639
and he gives us the test there in 1 John 4,

361
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:17,279
it's with regard to what people say about Jesus.

362
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,719
And I understand in this evening

363
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,139
I don't think we're speaking of,

364
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,379
I don't think the question

365
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,299
that has been submitted this evening

366
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,459
is with regard to some of the false religions of the world

367
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,579
that obviously cults, if you will,

368
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,259
that totally get it wrong on Jesus.

369
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,819
But understand that there are some mainline denominations

370
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,979
that also get it wrong with Jesus.

371
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,319
They teach that Jesus did some for your salvation,

372
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,639
but then there's something else

373
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,059
that needs to be done for your salvation.

374
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,579
Well, that's not the Jesus of the Bible.

375
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,719
Amen?

376
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,039
And so we find that obviously

377
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,579
that is of significant importance.

378
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,479
Let me ask this question.

379
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:57,399
When you think about doctrine for consideration,

380
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,399
areas of doctrine for consideration,

381
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:00,719
what about salvation?

382
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,519
What about salvation?

383
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,719
Soteriology, as we often refer to it as,

384
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,039
the doctrine of salvation.

385
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,519
And as we begin to think about salvation,

386
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,639
I'm thankful for what the word of God teaches

387
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,659
with regard to salvation.

388
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,479
I cannot partner with,

389
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,559
I cannot affiliate or associate

390
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,459
with someone that teaches Calvinism.

391
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,979
I just can't.

392
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:22,819
Why?

393
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,819
Because Calvinism is not biblical.

394
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,499
I do not find in the Bible

395
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,939
where God before the foundation of the world

396
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:33,179
determined who would be saved and who would not be saved.

397
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,219
I do find, however, in the word of God

398
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,939
that God did determine before the foundation of the world

399
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:40,259
how man would be saved.

400
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,579
And that is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

401
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:43,579
And that's why Jesus said,

402
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,719
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

403
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,079
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

404
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,339
That's why Peter could stand up with great boldness

405
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,899
in the book of Acts in the fourth chapter

406
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:52,879
in verse number 12 and say,

407
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,739
there's no other name under heaven

408
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:57,859
given among men whereby we must be saved.

409
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:00,099
The name of Jesus Christ.

410
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:05,099
But the idea, please, no pictures, no video, thank you.

411
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,279
What I'd like to say is this,

412
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,019
with regard to the teaching of Calvinism

413
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,699
is that they would say that there's a,

414
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:15,699
and I'm not gonna go through all of Calvinism this evening,

415
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,719
but listen, they would say that there's a limited atonement

416
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,279
that Jesus only died for the elect.

417
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,459
I got a problem with that.

418
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,639
Why do I have a problem with that?

419
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,519
Well, let me just show you one verse.

420
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,659
We could spend all night on this and we're not going to,

421
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,519
but look at the book of 1 John, if you will,

422
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,359
in the second chapter.

423
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,839
And notice here what the word of God says.

424
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,119
They often will say, see, we sing the song,

425
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,599
whosoever will may come.

426
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,519
Aren't you thankful that you're a whosoever?

427
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,099
The Bible says in Romans chapter 10 and verse number 13,

428
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,099
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

429
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,539
shall be saved.

430
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,379
Whosoever, I'm a whosoever, amen, and I'm thankful for that.

431
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:56,339
And Calvinism will all of a sudden say,

432
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,419
well, that's not really what whosoever means.

433
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,779
All doesn't really mean all.

434
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,679
World doesn't really mean world.

435
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,319
They begin to redefine terms.

436
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,719
I'm not telling you a line here.

437
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:12,099
I'm telling you the truth, okay?

438
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,039
And here's what the Bible says in 1 John 2

439
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,279
and verse number two.

440
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,079
And we know it's speaking of Jesus.

441
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,159
We see in verse number one, it says, my little children,

442
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,079
these things write I unto you that you sin not.

443
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,479
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

444
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,799
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

445
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,959
Aren't you thankful that we have an advocate with the Father?

446
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,479
Praise the Lord.

447
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:33,079
And that advocate is Jesus Christ.

448
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,399
And he, according to verse number two,

449
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,279
is the propitiation for our sins.

450
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,439
There's not a period there.

451
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:42,859
But I'm thankful for that.

452
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,699
He's writing to save people in the book of 1 John.

453
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,139
And you and I this evening, we'd say,

454
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,299
he is the propitiation for my sins, right?

455
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,139
Amen.

456
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:51,959
He's the covering.

457
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,699
He's the mercy seat.

458
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,979
He's the satisfaction for our sins.

459
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,139
God Almighty was satisfied with the offering

460
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,179
of the Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son,

461
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,299
God in the flesh on the cross of Calvary.

462
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:09,299
But note the next words, and not for ours only,

463
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:14,879
but also for the sins of the whole world.

464
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,639
There's no limited atonement.

465
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,779
God so loved the world that he gave himself.

466
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,119
He died for all of mankind.

467
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,759
So can I partner with someone that's Calvinistic?

468
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,659
I can't.

469
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,359
I can't.

470
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,359
Let me ask you this.

471
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,359
What if someone says that you need to have grace plus works

472
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,179
in order to be saved, or how about this,

473
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,079
in order to stay saved?

474
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,659
Is that what the Bible teaches us?

475
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:50,499
No.

476
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,259
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith

477
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,539
and that not of yourselves is the gift of God,

478
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,259
not of works, lest any man should boast.

479
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,159
And then it tells us this in the book of 1 Peter,

480
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,259
that we are kept by the power of God.

481
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,779
Listen, I'm not, we've mentioned this

482
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:06,539
throughout the study of the book of 1 John,

483
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,799
when he talks about the things that we're to do,

484
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,019
the evidences of our salvation,

485
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:12,799
when we look at the book of Ephesians

486
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,519
and see the walk of the believer,

487
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,239
the behavior of God's people,

488
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:19,879
he's not saying live like this so that you can be saved.

489
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:23,439
He's not saying live like this so that you can stay saved.

490
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,279
He's saying because you are saved,

491
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,799
this is how you're supposed to live.

492
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,079
This is how you're supposed to behave.

493
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,319
And it's not so that we can be saved,

494
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,519
nor is it so that we can stay saved.

495
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,339
Listen, if I could lose my salvation,

496
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,619
I would have lost it the day after I got it,

497
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,099
maybe an hour after I got it, amen?

498
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,279
I'm serious.

499
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:48,779
So if someone says it's grace plus works,

500
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,699
remember in the book of Galatians chapter two

501
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,059
in verse number 21, I believe it is,

502
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:54,259
Paul says, I do not frustrate the grace of God,

503
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:57,619
for if, and he talks about if righteousness came by the law,

504
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,019
then Christ is dead in vain.

505
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,399
Listen, my Savior did not die in vain.

506
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,459
He was raised from the dead.

507
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,779
And if I could earn my way to heaven through my works,

508
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,539
then there's no reason that Jesus Christ

509
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,259
had to leave the throne room of heaven

510
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:13,139
and come to this sin-cursed world

511
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:15,339
and die on that cruel cross.

512
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,299
But the reality is that I couldn't, neither could you.

513
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,899
And so he came so that he could do for us

514
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,979
what we could not do for ourselves.

515
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,819
So it's not grace plus works, it's grace alone.

516
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,419
And there are some denominations

517
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,099
that would teach grace plus works for salvation.

518
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,799
There are others, again, you need to be careful,

519
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,879
that would teach salvation is grace alone.

520
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,799
But then when you begin to understand and study,

521
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,999
you find that they say, but you need to have these works

522
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,559
in order to stay saved.

523
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,619
Now I want you to think about something with regard to that.

524
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:52,279
I believe, obviously, we can look historically

525
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,519
at some really large denominations

526
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,759
that had that teaching and still hold that teaching today.

527
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,559
And really what that teaching does.

528
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:05,599
does is it gives power to the clergy. It gives power to the clergy because the clergy is

529
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,599
able to say, hey, if you don't do this, then you're not saved. Well, all of a sudden, that's

530
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:16,159
a great motivator to get people to do things, to give money, to serve, to do whatever, right?

531
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,879
Because hey, you're not going to be saved if you don't do these things. But that's just

532
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:26,259
not what the Bible teaches. So I can't stand with someone that would say it's grace plus

533
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:32,539
works for salvation or even to keep my salvation. What about those that would teach that you

534
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,699
could lose your salvation? I'm sorry, the Bible says that we're kept by the power of

535
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:42,739
God. I'm sorry, but the Bible tells me that Jesus, He said, I know my sheep, they hear

536
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:47,139
my voice, they follow me. He says, I give unto them eternal life and they should never

537
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:55,219
perish. Those are precious words. He did not say that the gift of God is probationary life.

538
00:30:55,219 --> 00:31:00,739
He did not say that the gift of God is temporary life. He said that the gift of God is eternal

539
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:06,659
life. Aren't you thankful for that? I've never been on probation and I hope I never will

540
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:12,179
be. Amen? But the reality is that probation, if I understand it properly, you're out on

541
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,979
probation and you have to walk a pretty fine line or you go back to the big house, right?

542
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:23,939
It's kind of how it works. God didn't give you and I probationary life. He gave us eternal

543
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:29,539
life. He knows our frame. You know that He knew that you'd sin and He saved you anyway

544
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:38,299
because He's gracious, He's merciful. So you think about salvation, okay? All of a sudden

545
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:42,019
here's what we're doing. We're identifying, nope, I can't partner with that group of people.

546
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,179
Nope, I can't affiliate with them. Nope, I can't. And I'm not saying it to be prideful

547
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:49,739
or boastful and just stand up and say, we're the only ones that have it right. I'm just

548
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:54,379
simply saying, why is it that we'd say there are only this many people in this particular

549
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,899
country? Well, because I can't partner with someone that's teaching something contrary

550
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:08,099
to the Word of God. What about ecclesiology, the doctrine of the church? Listen, the church

551
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:17,819
is God's idea. It's not man's idea. The church was not Constantine's idea. Amen? The church

552
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,939
is God's idea. The Lord Jesus Christ said, I will build my church and the gates of hell

553
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:26,739
shall not prevail against it. So when we think about ecclesiology, we think about the church.

554
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:33,059
What about officers in the church? The Word of God teaches that there are two officers,

555
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:41,979
pastor and deacon. And by the way, they're to be men. So what about a denomination that

556
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:46,739
ordains women? Are we going to be okay with that? Are we going to say, well, we can partner

557
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:52,819
with them because there are some other things that are okay? Oh, you've got to be careful.

558
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,619
Where does it lead to? What kind of questions come in, right, when they start reading their

559
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:06,539
Bible and say, well, how does that? No, no. Many denominations have a hierarchical structure

560
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,539
or system. We find that the local churches throughout the New Testament are dealt with

561
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:18,019
as local churches. God gives a pastor as an under-shepherd. It is His church. He is

562
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:25,059
the head of the church. There's not some person on earth that, some hierarchical structure.

563
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:33,219
What about baptism? Does baptism matter? Sure it does. What does the Bible teach about baptism?

564
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:37,139
You know that there are a number of denominations that would teach infant baptism that would

565
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:43,459
practice infant baptism. Why don't we baptize infants? Because we believe the Bible teaches

566
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:50,939
clearly that the candidate for baptism is someone that is saved. Amen? That has professed

567
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:55,739
their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. There are some, I was doing some research, I was

568
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:59,859
going to give you a whole list of different denominations and call them all by name, and

569
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,739
I thought that might not be a good idea. The Spirit of God didn't give me permission to

570
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:06,379
do that. But I had all sorts of research and ready to do it. But you know, there are a

571
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:10,579
number of people, there's one denomination that said this, that will allow someone to

572
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:17,139
get baptized as long as there's someone else that's vowing that they will stand with them

573
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:24,779
and train them and teach them, and that when they're older, what in the world? That's not

574
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:28,979
what Philip said to the eunuch when the eunuch said, hey, there's water, see, here's water,

575
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:34,339
what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip says, if thou believe, believe what? That

576
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:41,219
Jesus is the Christ, that He's the Son of God, then you can. So when we baptize someone,

577
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:48,579
what do we say? I say this, we have a baptism, I say, if I'm baptizing, who hasn't been baptized

578
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:52,459
yet? Isaac, you haven't been baptized yet. And so I'm not saying that he should be, I'm

579
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:56,179
just saying, I'd say, Isaac, have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior?

580
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,899
He says, yes, I have. Are you sure that when you die that you're going to go to heaven?

581
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:07,299
And he says, yes, I am. And I say, Isaac, based upon your profession of faith, I now

582
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:11,339
baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, buried in the likeness

583
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:16,419
of His death, raised to walk in newness of life. So not only do we have the candidate,

584
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:22,419
but we have the mode. Are we okay with sprinkling? You understand what we're saying here? As

585
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:28,619
we begin to dig in and begin to look at doctrine and look at what the Word of God says, listen,

586
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:35,339
Paul didn't give any kind of lateral movement with regard to these things are the most important

587
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:40,619
things and these things, well, they're kind of just secondary. No, no, he says those things,

588
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:48,939
what you have heard of me, the sound words that I have taught you. Jude says the faith.

589
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:56,059
What about the Lord's Supper? There are denominations. It's just not the Catholics, by the way. There

590
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:01,479
are others that teach transubstantiation. What does that mean? Well, it means that they

591
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:09,299
teach that the bread literally turns into the body of Christ and that the blood literally

592
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:14,039
turns into the, or excuse me, the wine, the grape juice literally turns into the blood

593
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:20,699
of Jesus. When you read 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible tells us that it's a picture, that

594
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:29,699
it's a memorial. This do in remembrance of me, right? So, many denominations, they would

595
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:35,859
teach that with regard to baptism of the Lord's Supper, that's how you're born again. That's

596
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:40,179
what they would teach. Are you going to heaven? Well, have you been baptized? Have you taken

597
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:44,379
the Lord's Supper? Listen, it's not about baptism of the Lord's Supper to go to heaven.

598
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:47,939
Those are steps of obedience. Those are the ordinances for the local church. Those are

599
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:55,939
reminders of what Christ did for us, but salvation is through the Lord Jesus Christ, period.

600
00:36:55,939 --> 00:37:04,419
The thief on the cross didn't get baptized and didn't take the Lord's Supper, right?

601
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:09,539
So we find these things are important. What about eschatology, the doctrine of the end

602
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:16,779
times? I can't, we're out of time. Let me ask you this, what about today in our society

603
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:26,939
we're living in? What about human sexuality? Does it matter? Absolutely, it does. Does

604
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:34,299
it matter that God said that He made man and woman, male and female? Absolutely, it matters.

605
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:42,419
And so we begin to think about that, how many denominations have followed culture instead

606
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:54,259
of Bible, right? There's a pressure from the culture to fold, to cave in, to try to

607
00:37:54,259 --> 00:38:02,499
accommodate. Unfortunately, God said that we're to stand on the truth. I say unfortunately,

608
00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:06,419
but it's really not unfortunate. I'm thankful that God's given us the truth, amen? And truth

609
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:12,419
doesn't change. Truth is not relative, that it's your truth or my truth or their truth

610
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:19,379
or someone else's truth. It's God's truth, He is truth. And so human sexuality matters.

611
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:22,859
And you begin to find, listen, you don't even have to go to a lot of websites to find out

612
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,419
what churches believe on it. Just drive by their churches and you can see the signs.

613
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:32,299
They just put it right out there. By the way, there's some Baptist churches that are flying

614
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:39,019
flags that they shouldn't be flying, amen? It doesn't mean that we don't love people.

615
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:46,459
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying. I preached this morning about loving. Listen, love never

616
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:55,179
excuses sin. God's love is not a permissive love that I'm going to permit you to do whatever

617
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:00,859
you want to do because I love you. No, God's love is a protective love. And because God

618
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:04,779
loves us, He gives us the truth. And if we really love people, we need to tell them the

619
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:11,779
truth. Because honestly, if we think about this this evening, if we cave in to the pressures

620
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:16,779
of our society, to the pressures of our culture, if we try to be accommodating and we set aside

621
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:21,219
Bible truth and we just begin to tell people, hey, everything's going to be okay, you're

622
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:26,819
going to be just fine, just be sincere in what you believe, they're going to spend eternity

623
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:33,899
in the lake of fire. Because it's not about being sincere in what they believe. It's about

624
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:42,659
believing what Christ said, amen? And there's a great distinction between those two things.

625
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:51,979
What about godly living? Again, culture or Bible. Does holiness matter? Does godly living

626
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:59,019
matter? Sure it does. My Bible says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

627
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,219
Because He is holy.

628
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:05,699
And He said, be ye holy, for I am holy.

629
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:08,259
So holy living matters.

630
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:10,379
Bible versions.

631
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:11,779
Does it matter?

632
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,259
Sure it does.

633
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:16,139
You know how many of the modern translations today

634
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:19,259
are taking and attacking the person of Jesus Christ?

635
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,659
The doctrine.

636
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,899
So many people say, oh, the new modern translations,

637
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:25,699
they're just trying to ease of readability.

638
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,339
They're not really changing anything.

639
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,819
I would challenge you to study it out.

640
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:30,659
Study the verses.

641
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,179
This evening, we could go on and on.

642
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:37,579
But I hope that just these things

643
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,019
that I've shared with you tonight

644
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,739
would help us understand why ecumenical separation is

645
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:45,219
so important.

646
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:48,099
It's not enough for someone to say, I believe Jesus.

647
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,099
OK, I believe Jesus too.

648
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:50,819
Let's go.

649
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:53,059
No, there's a whole lot more.

650
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,979
And we must understand the doctrine, the faith that

651
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:57,779
was delivered to us.

652
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:00,859
And we're to earnestly contend for the faith.

653
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,939
And so when we begin to try to reach people

654
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:06,059
with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,

655
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,619
and we begin to partner with other groups of people

656
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:13,659
because we think that it's going to accomplish some greater

657
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:16,339
goal or greater accomplishment, and then we

658
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,779
find out that that particular group of people

659
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:21,459
is teaching something contrary to the word of God,

660
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:25,259
what mass confusion is the result?

661
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,899
Because we encourage people to read their Bibles,

662
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:31,259
and to begin to read their Bible,

663
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,819
and to begin to see, well, this isn't really lined up here.

664
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:35,399
And that's not really lined up there.

665
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:36,239
And what about this?

666
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,139
And what about that?

667
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:42,019
Are there people out there that we can fellowship with,

668
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:43,659
associate with?

669
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,379
Sure there are.

670
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,979
There are people that we can associate with.

671
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:48,779
But we must make sure that we do a test

672
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:51,539
and make sure that they align with this book.

673
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:52,819
And let me say this.

674
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:57,059
At the same time, we must make sure we align with this book.

675
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,499
Amen?

676
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,899
We say that it's the sole authority for our faith

677
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:02,059
and our practice.

678
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,699
And we must make sure that we align with this book,

679
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:07,819
that what we do is biblical, and that we're seeking

680
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,579
to please Him with our lives.

681
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:15,819
So can two walk together except they be agreed?

682
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:19,659
At what point along the journey does the division,

683
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:24,979
does the difference matter enough?

684
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:31,179
What Bible teaching would you be OK with just marking out

685
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,499
of your Bible, saying, OK, I'm going to take that,

686
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:35,659
and I'm going to just put that aside.

687
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:39,259
Because for the sake of whatever,

688
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:43,859
we're going to be willing to, man, this book is precious.

689
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:50,779
And God said every word is pure, every word.

690
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:56,099
I'm not going to take a pen knife or a Sharpie

691
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,259
and start removing things from my Bible.

692
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:03,219
We have to stand on the truth.

693
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:03,899
Amen?

694
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:05,819
Listen, it doesn't make us better.

695
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,019
It shouldn't result in pride.

696
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,459
I am humbled.

697
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:16,979
I am humbled that God allowed me to receive the truth,

698
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:19,459
honestly.

699
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:24,619
And I am not only humbled, but we have been entrusted,

700
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,939
and we are responsible to give the truth.

701
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,819
It's not about a group of people sitting back and saying,

702
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,299
we're right, everybody else is wrong.

703
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,259
No, that's the wrong approach.

704
00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:39,379
God's been so gracious to give me truth.

705
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:42,299
And now I want to give that truth to those

706
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:44,579
that He would allow me to come in contact with.

707
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:45,379
Let's pray together.

708
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:47,179
Father, we love you.

709
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:48,739
We thank you for loving us.

710
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,859
We thank you for the word of God and for the truth

711
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:51,619
contained therein.

712
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:56,739
We thank you for those things and sound words, the faith,

713
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:59,459
doctrine, sound doctrine.

714
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,899
Lord, we thank you so much for the word of God.

715
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:04,219
I pray that you would help us this evening, Lord,

716
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:08,099
in this moment of invitation, that we would just

717
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,259
rejoice in the fact that you've given us truth.

718
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:15,499
And then, God, I pray that you'd help us to be burdened,

719
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,739
to share that truth with others.

720
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,219
I pray that you'd move and work in the hearts of your people

721
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,019
as only you can, and we'll thank you for it.

722
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,099
In Christ's name, we pray.

723
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,379
Would you stand with me?

724
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,779
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

725
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:27,939
We'll have a moment of invitation this evening.

726
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:29,819
And Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

727
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:31,939
And as she does, maybe you want to visit this altar

728
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,179
and thank God for the truth, for the sound words

729
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,619
that he's given us.

730
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,059
Maybe you want to ask God to help

731
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:40,219
you to be faithful, to give that truth to others.

732
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,299
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
