WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.539
We're going to begin, however, in the book of Amos and Old Testament prophet, Hosea Joel

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:11.500
Amos, and try to help you out there, Amos chapter 3.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.340
And we'll give you just a moment to turn there, and I'll read to you the question that was

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.579
submitted for our message this evening.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:23.540
As many of you know, throughout the summer, and I know we're past the summer at this point,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.219
we have, on Sunday evenings, had a Ask the Pastor series.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:35.139
And we gave you opportunity to submit questions and ask the pastor, and those questions have

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:40.659
become a series that I've answered and try to answer these questions biblically and give

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.259
you the truth of the Word of God.

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:49.020
And this series, I was just mapping it out yesterday in my office, and it's probably

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020
going to take me until January to finish.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.840
And so, our summer series is going to go straight through the fall into the winter.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.259
But that's okay, and I'm thankful for the questions.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.599
I've often learned this over the years, that when someone has a question, it probably means

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.940
that someone else has a similar question.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.180
And so, it's been a real good opportunity.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.800
We did this several years ago, and thankful for the opportunity to do it again.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.739
But the question that was provided that we're looking at this evening actually had a disclaimer

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.819
put on the question, and I thought that was kind of interesting.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.620
The disclaimer was this, this is not an antagonistic question.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.519
And that's always encouraging when you see those words to begin the question.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.379
And the question reads this.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.919
It's a lengthy question, so I'll read the entirety of it.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:42.540
It says this, why are independent Baptist churches, that's what we are, reluctant to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.199
affiliate with other denominations when it comes to missions work?

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:52.739
The example that is given is missionaries will often say there are only X number of

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.639
independent Baptist churches in a particular area, the field in which they're going to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:57.760
minister.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.279
And then the question ends this way, do other denominations really not preach the gospel?

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:10.339
And so, this evening, as we begin to look at this particular question that was submitted,

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:15.039
really I have a few immediate thoughts with regard to this question that are actually

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:21.880
more questions in themselves of responding to that question, and just a few thoughts.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.080
Number one would be this, why don't we affiliate with other denominations here?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.320
Talking about the missions field and the reluctance of missionaries to affiliate or partner with

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.160
other denominations of people that are there, well, why don't we do it here?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.440
And I'll answer that as we get through the message this evening.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.399
But then let me ask this question, what distinguishes one denomination from another?

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.880
In other words, why do we call ourselves Baptist?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.919
What's in a name?

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.360
Does a name matter?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.839
I think a name does matter.

00:02:54.839 --> 00:03:01.520
I think it's extremely important when we say and we identify as being Baptist people, historically

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.119
that means something, and I'm thankful for what it means, and we understand.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:11.720
And listen, there's a number of Baptist churches that have not stood for what Baptists have

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.419
historically stood for, there's a slide that is taking place, but the reality is that historically

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.880
when someone would say I'm a Baptist, there's a number of things that you immediately begin

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.000
to understand about what that means.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.080
Of course, we would say this, that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.940
Now that in of itself sets us apart from a lot of denominations.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.419
And so the question about affiliation, really, we would ask ourselves what distinguishes

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.979
one denomination from another?

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.380
Is there really significance in a name?

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.740
I would say yes, it matters.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.320
Let me share this thought with you.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:00.179
What biblical teaching would we be willing to abandon in order to accomplish some goal?

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:08.300
Whatever that goal is, the goal of ecumenical partnership, the goal of this affiliation,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.179
what teaching of the Bible would we be willing to abandon to set aside for the purpose of

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.660
trying to accomplish some goal?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.619
I hope that we'd say none, amen?

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:25.040
Because the Bible is the sole authority for faith and practice.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.480
And so we cannot say, well, that doesn't really matter.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.640
Or for the sake of unity, no, there is no unity apart from God.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.920
There's no unity apart from this book.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.920
And if we're going to have unity, it's because we're going to agree with God, not because

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.679
we're going to try to agree with each other apart from God.

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:51.200
Then I had this thought, how much is enough to agree on?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200
Where do we kind of draw that line?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.260
Where does it say, well, that's enough?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.940
Is there enough in common that we can partner with and we can affiliate with?

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.420
And those are just some immediate thoughts and questions.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.619
And really, the subject that is before us this evening is of significant importance.

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:10.619
It is absolutely worthy of our study.

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.720
I believe that when we could define the question this evening, that really what we're dealing

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.000
with is ecumenical separation.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.220
We're dealing with the subject of ecumenical separation.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.700
I've titled the message this evening there from Amos 3.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.140
I used the entire verse as our title this evening.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.420
Verse number 3, can two walk together except they be agreed?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.660
We begin to think about this subject of ecumenical separation, begin to think about this affiliation

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.540
that's being referenced, and missionaries mentioning that there's only, I think when

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.579
Brother Thomas was here, he mentioned there were six or seven independent Baptist missionaries

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:51.859
in all of Guatemala.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:56.260
And you begin to understand, as we would make those distinctions, in fact, I've even spoken

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.220
about the number of independent Baptist churches in Fairfax County, in Northern Virginia, and

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.619
we begin to understand those churches that are standing on that same faith that we would

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.859
hold dear and that we'd understand.

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:15.540
Let me say this when we speak about ecumenical separation, it is important for us to note

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.500
that the New Testament, and we'll look at a number of verses this evening in the New

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.660
Testament, that the New Testament does not define essential and non-essential doctrine.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.339
There's no distinguishing in the New Testament between this being an essential doctrine and

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.779
this being a non-essential doctrine.

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.820
Now I understand that oftentimes we will speak about the fundamentals of the faith and we'll

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:48.220
speak about these essential doctrines, but you understand that this is more of our identifying

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.459
the particular doctrines and us classifying the teaching of the Word of God.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.940
We do not see this distinction within the Bible.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.859
Let me show you a few verses of Scripture.

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:03.040
Notice in the book of Philippians, if you will, and I want you to see as God is giving

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.040
us the truth in the New Testament with regard to the body of doctrine, the faith that was

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.260
delivered to us, I want you to see what Paul is saying here in the book of Philippians

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.619
as he's writing to a local church, the church in Philippi, and he comes to the conclusion,

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:22.940
he's in Philippians 4, and notice in verse number 9, I want you to notice how he says

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.700
this under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, those things which you have

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:37.100
both learned and received and heard and seen in me do, and the God of peace shall be with

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.100
you.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.420
Now, he summarizes everything that he taught them with those things, right?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.459
That's how he summarizes the body of doctrine that he taught the believers in Philippi,

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:52.220
all of the teaching that he gave.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:58.179
He says those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do.

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:02.519
There's no real exception in that verse of Scripture, and we find that as he's talking

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.179
to Timothy, turn to the book of 2 Timothy chapter number 1, and I want you to see what

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:08.420
he says here to Timothy.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.459
There's a whole host of verses that we could look at.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.859
I'm just picking a few so that we can get through the message this evening, and I want

00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:20.859
you to see how that the Word of God references the body of doctrine, the faith, if you will,

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:26.420
that we hold dear, and the importance of the fact that the New Testament does not make

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.220
a distinction or define between essential and non-essential.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.960
Notice in 2 Timothy 1 and verse number 13, notice where he says, hold fast the form of

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.960
sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.880
So we find that he refers here, as he's speaking to Timothy, this teaching, this doctrine as

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.679
sound words.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.200
If you read the book of Titus, and we won't take time to look at the book of Titus this

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.039
evening, but if you look at the book of Titus, you'll see that Titus is given the instruction

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:07.580
to go and to ordain leadership there, and we find that he's given the responsibility

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.320
on a number of occasion with regard to sound doctrine.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.760
Sound doctrine.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.039
Jude has only one chapter, but I want you to see the significance of what we find in

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:26.520
Jude as he's writing here, and he gives us, it's amazing as you begin to look at the introduction

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.440
here as to what Jude is dealing with, and it's interesting where it says in verse number

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.359
three of Jude, he says, Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:43.359
salvation, then notice where he says, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:50.760
you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.880
saints.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.840
So now here in the book of Jude, how does Jude refer to doctrine or the body of doctrine?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.479
He refers to it as the faith.

00:09:59.479 --> 00:10:04.479
Things, sound words, the faith.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:08.239
And we find that it's inclusive of all the teaching.

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:13.359
And we find here that Jude says it was needful for me to write, and not only to write but

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:18.759
to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:19.759
the saints.

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:23.279
So we have a faith which is worth contending for.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.359
Amen?

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:25.899
Do you believe that this evening?

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:30.739
When we think about doctrine, listen, doctrine matters.

00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:31.739
Doctrine is important.

00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:35.979
And we begin to think about doctrine this evening, and we understand the importance

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:36.979
of doctrine.

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:44.179
I'm thankful that we have a doctrine that is worth fighting for, contending for, standing

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:46.779
on the truth of the Word of God.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.379
It's not my doctrine.

00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:53.059
It's not some religious organization, some denomination's doctrine.

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:55.299
It's Bible doctrine.

00:10:55.299 --> 00:11:02.659
And we must understand and make that distinction that what God says settles it.

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:03.659
Just settles it.

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:06.699
I said this on Wednesday evening, and then on Thursday evening I heard another preacher

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:11.299
say it, and he's about 40 years older than I am, not quite, maybe 35 years older than

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:12.299
I am.

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:14.179
And I said to Holly, I was like, I like what he said.

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.619
I said the same thing on Wednesday evening, and here's what it is.

00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:21.619
Listen, I didn't write the Bible, I'm just telling you what it says.

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:25.659
If you've got a problem with it, you've got a problem with God, right?

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:29.979
And we can rejoice in that in saying, here's what God said.

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:32.179
And so we find that there's no distinction.

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:36.739
Let me show you, however, what the Bible says with regard to those that would teach some

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.859
other doctrine.

00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:40.779
Turn back to the book of Romans, if you will.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:44.659
In the 16th chapter, I told you that we'd be in a number of passages, and I want to

00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:50.299
give you some things to think about this evening with regard to the subject of ecumenical separation

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:56.819
and why it is that we would not partner with, affiliate with people that do not hold the

00:11:56.819 --> 00:12:02.099
same teaching or doctrine that we do, and then give you some thoughts with regard to

00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:03.099
that.

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:10.699
In Romans chapter number 16, in verses 17 and 18, notice what the Bible says.

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:18.619
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to what?

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:26.319
To the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.

00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:29.299
So in verse number 17, we're given two instructions.

00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:34.899
One is to mark them, and two is to avoid them.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:37.859
That's pretty strong language.

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:40.219
Mark them and avoid them.

00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:45.019
Notice in verse number 18, for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:51.499
their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:58.219
Listen, if I'm going to mark someone that has false doctrine, it must mean that I have

00:12:58.219 --> 00:13:01.459
to know Bible doctrine.

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:06.219
I can't mark someone that's teaching someone that's false or something that is false.

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:11.379
I can't avoid someone that's teaching something that's false if I don't know the truth.

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:14.659
That's why it's so important that we have a good handle on the Word of God.

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:18.379
That's why it's so important that we study to show ourselves approved unto God, a workman

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:22.459
that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth.

00:13:22.459 --> 00:13:27.499
And we find that here, the instruction, notice what Paul says, now I beseech you.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:31.899
I mean, we look at this word and we speak about the significance.

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:37.419
Paul's saying, I'm begging you, don't mingle, don't mix.

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:43.019
Mark those that are not teaching sound doctrine that cause divisions and offenses that are

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:48.099
contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them.

00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:57.459
Notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 3, 2 Thessalonians chapter number 3, and notice

00:13:57.459 --> 00:14:07.859
in verse number 14, this is very interesting because it's speaking about those that aren't

00:14:07.859 --> 00:14:14.299
obeying even the words of the epistle that is written to a local church.

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:18.779
And if you look contextually, he's dealing with those that would not work and also with

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:20.579
those that are busybodies.

00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:25.099
And he says this in verse number 14, and if any man obey not our word by this epistle,

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:29.099
note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed.

00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:30.979
Wow.

00:14:30.979 --> 00:14:34.579
Note them and have no company with them.

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:39.019
Notice in 1 Timothy chapter number 6, just a few pages over, in 1 Timothy chapter number

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:51.299
6, in verses 3 through 5, in 1 Timothy 6 and verses 3 through 5, the Bible says this beginning

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:58.099
in verse number 3, if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the

00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:02.579
words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:06.739
And so we find what Paul is referring to as being what we referenced earlier, those

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:11.619
things, sound words, the faith, as Jude refers to it.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:16.379
He says if someone's teaching contrary to that, otherwise, he notes it in verse number

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:21.059
4, he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:26.719
cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:30.779
and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness.

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:37.099
Notice what he says at the end, from such withdraw thyself.

00:15:37.099 --> 00:15:39.739
From such withdraw thyself.

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:46.199
It doesn't say find what's common between you and them and just embrace those common

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:49.739
things for the cause of X.

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:54.739
No, no, he says from such withdraw thyself.

00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:58.999
Notice in the book of Titus in chapter number 3, I mentioned already that Titus had the

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.259
responsibility of being given the commission.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:06.319
In fact, Paul says that he left him in Crete for this purpose, that he would set in order

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:10.319
things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city that I had appointed thee.

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:14.019
He gives them the truth of those that are…the sound doctrine.

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:17.319
He mentions it three times within about 12 verses.

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:23.239
And we find as we come to chapter number 3, in verse number 9, the Bible says, but avoid

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:27.519
foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law, for they are

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:31.199
unprofitable in vain, for they are unprofitable in vain.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:38.199
A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition, what does it say?

00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:39.199
Reject.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:43.919
The word heretic is a follower of a false doctrine, that's what it means.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.499
We use the word heresy.

00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:52.959
You understand we've used the word apostasy or apostate, and you notice that many that

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:58.639
are today of these, if you quote-unquote call them mainline denominations, that there's…they

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.139
are apostate.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:06.279
They are heretical in their teaching, following false teaching, false doctrine.

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:11.719
The issue facing the believers in the churches throughout the region of Galatia is addressed

00:17:11.719 --> 00:17:12.719
in the book of Galatians.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:17.599
I don't have time to look at the entirety of the book of Galatians this evening, but

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:23.639
as you study the book of Galatians, you will find that Paul is addressing head-on this

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:28.839
problem that is facing these churches in the region of Galatia, these churches that were

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.219
established during that first missionary journey.

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:36.199
And there were some false teachers, they were called Judaizers, and these Judaizers were

00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:42.159
coming in and they were teaching that works are necessary to be saved.

00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:46.159
And here's what the Bible says in Acts chapter 15, we're going to look at Galatians 1, but

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:52.879
let me tell you what Acts 15 says with regard to really the situation in the region of Galatia.

00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:57.719
The council, if you will, in Jerusalem in Acts 15 is in reference to what's happening

00:17:57.719 --> 00:17:59.159
in Galatia.

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:05.439
And as we follow the chronological understanding of the book of Acts and what's happening with

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:10.759
regard to the other churches and the other regions, you find that this council that's

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:15.799
called in Jerusalem, that's referenced and recorded for us in Acts 15, has everything

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:21.159
to do with what Paul is writing in the book of Galatians to these churches in the region

00:18:21.159 --> 00:18:22.319
of Galatia.

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:26.199
And it is with regard to the Judaizers, and here's what the Judaizers were saying.

00:18:26.199 --> 00:18:28.999
It's spelled out for us in Acts 15 in verse number 1,

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:33.639
And certain men which came down from Judea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be

00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:41.359
circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:47.079
Paul says, I have a problem with that, because salvation is by grace through faith.

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.079
Grace alone.

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:49.079
Amen?

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:51.079
It's not grace plus law.

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:53.599
It's not in you have to be circumcised, no, no, no.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.599
And so this drew sharp contention.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:59.320
There's a great council that takes place in Jerusalem.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.000
If you read the entirety of Acts 15, you see the discussion that takes place, and I'm thankful

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:07.719
that in verse number 11, it says, We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:07.719 --> 00:19:12.639
we shall be saved even as they, glory, hallelujah, they got it right.

00:19:12.639 --> 00:19:17.919
They understood the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of course, the apostles, they're

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.119
giving that truth.

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:23.279
But I want you to see what Paul says in the book of Galatians in chapter number 1.

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:29.199
I want it to reference that Acts 15 so that we could understand contextually what's happening.

00:19:29.199 --> 00:19:34.279
And notice the language that Paul uses in Galatians 1.

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:36.479
It is strong language.

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:42.479
In verse number 6, he says, I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:48.919
you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another, but there be

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:53.239
some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

00:19:53.239 --> 00:19:57.599
But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, then that which

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.199
we have preached unto you...

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:03.959
let him be accursed."

00:20:03.959 --> 00:20:05.039
Let him be accursed.

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.119
Notice in v. 9,

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:07.159
as we said before,

00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:08.419
"...so say I now again,

00:20:08.419 --> 00:20:10.459
if any man preach any other gospel unto you

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.879
than that ye have received,

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:15.799
let him be accursed.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.759
For do I now persuade men, or God,

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.559
or do I seek to please men?

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.679
For if I yet please men,

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.759
I should not be the servant of Christ."

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:25.259
Paul's not trying to be a man pleaser.

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:26.939
Paul says, I know, in fact,

00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:27.979
in v. 11 he says,

00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:29.319
I certify you, brethren,

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.319
that the gospel which was preached of me

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:33.219
is not after man.

00:20:33.219 --> 00:20:34.719
For I neither received it of man,

00:20:34.719 --> 00:20:35.919
neither was I taught it,

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:38.639
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:40.519
He says I'm not trying to please men.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.839
I'm not trying to make friends, so to speak.

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:45.759
I'm trying to please God.

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:48.059
And so therefore, if these Judaizers

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:50.119
are coming in and they're teaching

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:52.619
contrary to what I've delivered unto you,

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:56.539
let him be accursed.

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.479
That's a strong language.

00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:00.939
So we begin to think about the New Testament

00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.659
and the teaching that is laid out

00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:06.679
with regard to the sound words.

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:08.199
Those things.

00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:09.419
The faith.

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:12.239
Sound doctrine that is mentioned

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:14.399
multiple times in the book of Titus.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.659
We see what the Bible says in the New Testament

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:19.279
about those that would teach something that's contrary.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.579
And now I ask the question again,

00:21:21.579 --> 00:21:24.479
what is it that we'd be willing

00:21:24.479 --> 00:21:27.419
to set aside or to abandon

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:30.379
in order to accomplish something?

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.859
What part of our Bible would we be okay

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:34.899
with just cutting out and setting aside

00:21:34.899 --> 00:21:36.419
and saying no, I don't need that?

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:38.619
And you say, well, that kind of brings it to another level.

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:39.579
I understand.

00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:41.579
And that's really what we've got to do in our mind

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:43.059
is we just kind of tear a page out

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:44.179
and say okay, I don't like that.

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.379
I'm going to get rid of it.

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:46.739
Well, we would never do that.

00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:48.379
I hope not anyway.

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:49.259
Right?

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:51.499
We're not going to take portions of God's Word

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:53.899
and just tear them out and say nope, we don't need that.

00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:58.239
We're not going to take a black Sharpie marker

00:21:58.239 --> 00:22:01.639
and just mark through portions of verses of Scripture

00:22:01.639 --> 00:22:04.919
so that we can have some level of affiliation

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:07.919
with some other group of people, some other denomination.

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.259
No, doctrine matters.

00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:14.419
And so as we begin to consider the subject,

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:15.839
I just have several things, and again,

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.199
I'm not going to teach through all of this this evening.

00:22:18.199 --> 00:22:20.799
I hope that it's enough to give us an answer

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:24.299
to help us have some direction for our own lives

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.939
with regard to studying and understanding

00:22:26.939 --> 00:22:28.459
and being able to draw that line

00:22:28.459 --> 00:22:32.319
as to where we would have fellowship or cooperation.

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:35.259
Obviously, we think about theology or the teaching,

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:38.299
the doctrine of God, the deity of Christ.

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:42.419
Listen, there is no room for movement

00:22:42.419 --> 00:22:44.619
with regard to the deity of Christ.

00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:46.099
Amen?

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:49.579
So many, so many have gotten it wrong

00:22:49.579 --> 00:22:51.919
on the person of Jesus Christ.

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.799
And listen, if you get it wrong with Jesus,

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.399
you get it wrong.

00:22:56.399 --> 00:22:58.359
It's just wrong, amen?

00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:00.239
We've studied through the book of 1 John

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.519
here on Sunday mornings throughout this year,

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.879
and as you go to the fourth chapter,

00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:07.079
you understand he talks about trying the spirits.

00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:08.879
And we understand the importance

00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:10.799
of being able to identify,

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:13.639
and he gives us the test there in 1 John 4,

00:23:13.639 --> 00:23:17.279
it's with regard to what people say about Jesus.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.719
And I understand in this evening

00:23:18.719 --> 00:23:20.139
I don't think we're speaking of,

00:23:20.139 --> 00:23:21.379
I don't think the question

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:23.299
that has been submitted this evening

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:27.459
is with regard to some of the false religions of the world

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:29.579
that obviously cults, if you will,

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:32.259
that totally get it wrong on Jesus.

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:34.819
But understand that there are some mainline denominations

00:23:34.819 --> 00:23:36.979
that also get it wrong with Jesus.

00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:43.319
They teach that Jesus did some for your salvation,

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:44.639
but then there's something else

00:23:44.639 --> 00:23:46.059
that needs to be done for your salvation.

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:48.579
Well, that's not the Jesus of the Bible.

00:23:49.439 --> 00:23:50.719
Amen?

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:53.039
And so we find that obviously

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.579
that is of significant importance.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:55.479
Let me ask this question.

00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:57.399
When you think about doctrine for consideration,

00:23:57.399 --> 00:23:59.399
areas of doctrine for consideration,

00:23:59.399 --> 00:24:00.719
what about salvation?

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:02.519
What about salvation?

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:04.719
Soteriology, as we often refer to it as,

00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:07.039
the doctrine of salvation.

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:09.519
And as we begin to think about salvation,

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:11.639
I'm thankful for what the word of God teaches

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.659
with regard to salvation.

00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:15.479
I cannot partner with,

00:24:15.479 --> 00:24:17.559
I cannot affiliate or associate

00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:19.459
with someone that teaches Calvinism.

00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:21.979
I just can't.

00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:22.819
Why?

00:24:22.819 --> 00:24:24.819
Because Calvinism is not biblical.

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.499
I do not find in the Bible

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:29.939
where God before the foundation of the world

00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:33.179
determined who would be saved and who would not be saved.

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:35.219
I do find, however, in the word of God

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:37.939
that God did determine before the foundation of the world

00:24:37.939 --> 00:24:40.259
how man would be saved.

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:42.579
And that is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:43.579
And that's why Jesus said,

00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:45.719
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:24:45.739 --> 00:24:48.079
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:50.339
That's why Peter could stand up with great boldness

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:51.899
in the book of Acts in the fourth chapter

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:52.879
in verse number 12 and say,

00:24:52.879 --> 00:24:54.739
there's no other name under heaven

00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:57.859
given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:00.099
The name of Jesus Christ.

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:05.099
But the idea, please, no pictures, no video, thank you.

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:07.279
What I'd like to say is this,

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:10.019
with regard to the teaching of Calvinism

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:11.699
is that they would say that there's a,

00:25:11.699 --> 00:25:15.699
and I'm not gonna go through all of Calvinism this evening,

00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:19.719
but listen, they would say that there's a limited atonement

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:23.279
that Jesus only died for the elect.

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:25.459
I got a problem with that.

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:26.639
Why do I have a problem with that?

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:28.519
Well, let me just show you one verse.

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.659
We could spend all night on this and we're not going to,

00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:32.519
but look at the book of 1 John, if you will,

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:34.359
in the second chapter.

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:37.839
And notice here what the word of God says.

00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:40.119
They often will say, see, we sing the song,

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.599
whosoever will may come.

00:25:41.599 --> 00:25:43.519
Aren't you thankful that you're a whosoever?

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.099
The Bible says in Romans chapter 10 and verse number 13,

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:48.099
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:50.539
shall be saved.

00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:54.379
Whosoever, I'm a whosoever, amen, and I'm thankful for that.

00:25:54.379 --> 00:25:56.339
And Calvinism will all of a sudden say,

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:58.419
well, that's not really what whosoever means.

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:00.779
All doesn't really mean all.

00:26:00.779 --> 00:26:02.679
World doesn't really mean world.

00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:05.319
They begin to redefine terms.

00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:08.719
I'm not telling you a line here.

00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:12.099
I'm telling you the truth, okay?

00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:15.039
And here's what the Bible says in 1 John 2

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.279
and verse number two.

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:18.079
And we know it's speaking of Jesus.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:20.159
We see in verse number one, it says, my little children,

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:22.079
these things write I unto you that you sin not.

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:24.479
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:25.799
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:28.959
Aren't you thankful that we have an advocate with the Father?

00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:30.479
Praise the Lord.

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:33.079
And that advocate is Jesus Christ.

00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:35.399
And he, according to verse number two,

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:39.279
is the propitiation for our sins.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:41.439
There's not a period there.

00:26:41.459 --> 00:26:42.859
But I'm thankful for that.

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:45.699
He's writing to save people in the book of 1 John.

00:26:45.699 --> 00:26:47.139
And you and I this evening, we'd say,

00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:50.299
he is the propitiation for my sins, right?

00:26:50.299 --> 00:26:51.139
Amen.

00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:51.959
He's the covering.

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:53.699
He's the mercy seat.

00:26:53.699 --> 00:26:56.979
He's the satisfaction for our sins.

00:26:56.979 --> 00:27:00.139
God Almighty was satisfied with the offering

00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:02.179
of the Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son,

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:04.299
God in the flesh on the cross of Calvary.

00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:09.299
But note the next words, and not for ours only,

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:14.879
but also for the sins of the whole world.

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:17.639
There's no limited atonement.

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:21.779
God so loved the world that he gave himself.

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.119
He died for all of mankind.

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:27.759
So can I partner with someone that's Calvinistic?

00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:28.659
I can't.

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:31.359
I can't.

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.359
Let me ask you this.

00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:37.359
What if someone says that you need to have grace plus works

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:43.179
in order to be saved, or how about this,

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:45.079
in order to stay saved?

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:49.659
Is that what the Bible teaches us?

00:27:49.659 --> 00:27:50.499
No.

00:27:50.499 --> 00:27:52.259
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:54.539
and that not of yourselves is the gift of God,

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:58.259
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:00.159
And then it tells us this in the book of 1 Peter,

00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:03.259
that we are kept by the power of God.

00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:04.779
Listen, I'm not, we've mentioned this

00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:06.539
throughout the study of the book of 1 John,

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.799
when he talks about the things that we're to do,

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:11.019
the evidences of our salvation,

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:12.799
when we look at the book of Ephesians

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.519
and see the walk of the believer,

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:16.239
the behavior of God's people,

00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:19.879
he's not saying live like this so that you can be saved.

00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:23.439
He's not saying live like this so that you can stay saved.

00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:26.279
He's saying because you are saved,

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:27.799
this is how you're supposed to live.

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.079
This is how you're supposed to behave.

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:32.319
And it's not so that we can be saved,

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:35.519
nor is it so that we can stay saved.

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:37.339
Listen, if I could lose my salvation,

00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:39.619
I would have lost it the day after I got it,

00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:42.099
maybe an hour after I got it, amen?

00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:43.279
I'm serious.

00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:48.779
So if someone says it's grace plus works,

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:50.699
remember in the book of Galatians chapter two

00:28:50.699 --> 00:28:52.059
in verse number 21, I believe it is,

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.259
Paul says, I do not frustrate the grace of God,

00:28:54.259 --> 00:28:57.619
for if, and he talks about if righteousness came by the law,

00:28:57.619 --> 00:29:01.019
then Christ is dead in vain.

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:03.399
Listen, my Savior did not die in vain.

00:29:03.499 --> 00:29:05.459
He was raised from the dead.

00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.779
And if I could earn my way to heaven through my works,

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:09.539
then there's no reason that Jesus Christ

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.259
had to leave the throne room of heaven

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:13.139
and come to this sin-cursed world

00:29:13.139 --> 00:29:15.339
and die on that cruel cross.

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:19.299
But the reality is that I couldn't, neither could you.

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.899
And so he came so that he could do for us

00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:24.979
what we could not do for ourselves.

00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:28.819
So it's not grace plus works, it's grace alone.

00:29:28.819 --> 00:29:30.419
And there are some denominations

00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:33.099
that would teach grace plus works for salvation.

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:35.799
There are others, again, you need to be careful,

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:39.879
that would teach salvation is grace alone.

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:41.799
But then when you begin to understand and study,

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:43.999
you find that they say, but you need to have these works

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.559
in order to stay saved.

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:48.619
Now I want you to think about something with regard to that.

00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:52.279
I believe, obviously, we can look historically

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:54.519
at some really large denominations

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.759
that had that teaching and still hold that teaching today.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:59.559
And really what that teaching does.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:05.599
does is it gives power to the clergy. It gives power to the clergy because the clergy is

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:10.599
able to say, hey, if you don't do this, then you're not saved. Well, all of a sudden, that's

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:16.159
a great motivator to get people to do things, to give money, to serve, to do whatever, right?

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:19.879
Because hey, you're not going to be saved if you don't do these things. But that's just

00:30:19.879 --> 00:30:26.259
not what the Bible teaches. So I can't stand with someone that would say it's grace plus

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:32.539
works for salvation or even to keep my salvation. What about those that would teach that you

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:36.699
could lose your salvation? I'm sorry, the Bible says that we're kept by the power of

00:30:36.699 --> 00:30:42.739
God. I'm sorry, but the Bible tells me that Jesus, He said, I know my sheep, they hear

00:30:42.739 --> 00:30:47.139
my voice, they follow me. He says, I give unto them eternal life and they should never

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:55.219
perish. Those are precious words. He did not say that the gift of God is probationary life.

00:30:55.219 --> 00:31:00.739
He did not say that the gift of God is temporary life. He said that the gift of God is eternal

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:06.659
life. Aren't you thankful for that? I've never been on probation and I hope I never will

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:12.179
be. Amen? But the reality is that probation, if I understand it properly, you're out on

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:17.979
probation and you have to walk a pretty fine line or you go back to the big house, right?

00:31:17.979 --> 00:31:23.939
It's kind of how it works. God didn't give you and I probationary life. He gave us eternal

00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:29.539
life. He knows our frame. You know that He knew that you'd sin and He saved you anyway

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:38.299
because He's gracious, He's merciful. So you think about salvation, okay? All of a sudden

00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:42.019
here's what we're doing. We're identifying, nope, I can't partner with that group of people.

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:46.179
Nope, I can't affiliate with them. Nope, I can't. And I'm not saying it to be prideful

00:31:46.179 --> 00:31:49.739
or boastful and just stand up and say, we're the only ones that have it right. I'm just

00:31:49.739 --> 00:31:54.379
simply saying, why is it that we'd say there are only this many people in this particular

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:58.899
country? Well, because I can't partner with someone that's teaching something contrary

00:31:58.899 --> 00:32:08.099
to the Word of God. What about ecclesiology, the doctrine of the church? Listen, the church

00:32:08.099 --> 00:32:17.819
is God's idea. It's not man's idea. The church was not Constantine's idea. Amen? The church

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:21.939
is God's idea. The Lord Jesus Christ said, I will build my church and the gates of hell

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:26.739
shall not prevail against it. So when we think about ecclesiology, we think about the church.

00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:33.059
What about officers in the church? The Word of God teaches that there are two officers,

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:41.979
pastor and deacon. And by the way, they're to be men. So what about a denomination that

00:32:41.979 --> 00:32:46.739
ordains women? Are we going to be okay with that? Are we going to say, well, we can partner

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:52.819
with them because there are some other things that are okay? Oh, you've got to be careful.

00:32:52.819 --> 00:32:56.619
Where does it lead to? What kind of questions come in, right, when they start reading their

00:32:56.619 --> 00:33:06.539
Bible and say, well, how does that? No, no. Many denominations have a hierarchical structure

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:11.539
or system. We find that the local churches throughout the New Testament are dealt with

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:18.019
as local churches. God gives a pastor as an under-shepherd. It is His church. He is

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:25.059
the head of the church. There's not some person on earth that, some hierarchical structure.

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:33.219
What about baptism? Does baptism matter? Sure it does. What does the Bible teach about baptism?

00:33:33.219 --> 00:33:37.139
You know that there are a number of denominations that would teach infant baptism that would

00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:43.459
practice infant baptism. Why don't we baptize infants? Because we believe the Bible teaches

00:33:43.459 --> 00:33:50.939
clearly that the candidate for baptism is someone that is saved. Amen? That has professed

00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:55.739
their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. There are some, I was doing some research, I was

00:33:55.739 --> 00:33:59.859
going to give you a whole list of different denominations and call them all by name, and

00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:02.739
I thought that might not be a good idea. The Spirit of God didn't give me permission to

00:34:02.739 --> 00:34:06.379
do that. But I had all sorts of research and ready to do it. But you know, there are a

00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:10.579
number of people, there's one denomination that said this, that will allow someone to

00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:17.139
get baptized as long as there's someone else that's vowing that they will stand with them

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:24.779
and train them and teach them, and that when they're older, what in the world? That's not

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:28.979
what Philip said to the eunuch when the eunuch said, hey, there's water, see, here's water,

00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:34.339
what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip says, if thou believe, believe what? That

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:41.219
Jesus is the Christ, that He's the Son of God, then you can. So when we baptize someone,

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:48.579
what do we say? I say this, we have a baptism, I say, if I'm baptizing, who hasn't been baptized

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:52.459
yet? Isaac, you haven't been baptized yet. And so I'm not saying that he should be, I'm

00:34:52.459 --> 00:34:56.179
just saying, I'd say, Isaac, have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior?

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.899
He says, yes, I have. Are you sure that when you die that you're going to go to heaven?

00:34:58.899 --> 00:35:07.299
And he says, yes, I am. And I say, Isaac, based upon your profession of faith, I now

00:35:07.299 --> 00:35:11.339
baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, buried in the likeness

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:16.419
of His death, raised to walk in newness of life. So not only do we have the candidate,

00:35:16.419 --> 00:35:22.419
but we have the mode. Are we okay with sprinkling? You understand what we're saying here? As

00:35:22.419 --> 00:35:28.619
we begin to dig in and begin to look at doctrine and look at what the Word of God says, listen,

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:35.339
Paul didn't give any kind of lateral movement with regard to these things are the most important

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:40.619
things and these things, well, they're kind of just secondary. No, no, he says those things,

00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:48.939
what you have heard of me, the sound words that I have taught you. Jude says the faith.

00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:56.059
What about the Lord's Supper? There are denominations. It's just not the Catholics, by the way. There

00:35:56.059 --> 00:36:01.479
are others that teach transubstantiation. What does that mean? Well, it means that they

00:36:01.479 --> 00:36:09.299
teach that the bread literally turns into the body of Christ and that the blood literally

00:36:09.299 --> 00:36:14.039
turns into the, or excuse me, the wine, the grape juice literally turns into the blood

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:20.699
of Jesus. When you read 1 Corinthians 11, the Bible tells us that it's a picture, that

00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:29.699
it's a memorial. This do in remembrance of me, right? So, many denominations, they would

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:35.859
teach that with regard to baptism of the Lord's Supper, that's how you're born again. That's

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:40.179
what they would teach. Are you going to heaven? Well, have you been baptized? Have you taken

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:44.379
the Lord's Supper? Listen, it's not about baptism of the Lord's Supper to go to heaven.

00:36:44.379 --> 00:36:47.939
Those are steps of obedience. Those are the ordinances for the local church. Those are

00:36:48.019 --> 00:36:55.939
reminders of what Christ did for us, but salvation is through the Lord Jesus Christ, period.

00:36:55.939 --> 00:37:04.419
The thief on the cross didn't get baptized and didn't take the Lord's Supper, right?

00:37:04.419 --> 00:37:09.539
So we find these things are important. What about eschatology, the doctrine of the end

00:37:09.539 --> 00:37:16.779
times? I can't, we're out of time. Let me ask you this, what about today in our society

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:26.939
we're living in? What about human sexuality? Does it matter? Absolutely, it does. Does

00:37:26.939 --> 00:37:34.299
it matter that God said that He made man and woman, male and female? Absolutely, it matters.

00:37:34.299 --> 00:37:42.419
And so we begin to think about that, how many denominations have followed culture instead

00:37:42.419 --> 00:37:54.259
of Bible, right? There's a pressure from the culture to fold, to cave in, to try to

00:37:54.259 --> 00:38:02.499
accommodate. Unfortunately, God said that we're to stand on the truth. I say unfortunately,

00:38:02.499 --> 00:38:06.419
but it's really not unfortunate. I'm thankful that God's given us the truth, amen? And truth

00:38:06.419 --> 00:38:12.419
doesn't change. Truth is not relative, that it's your truth or my truth or their truth

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:19.379
or someone else's truth. It's God's truth, He is truth. And so human sexuality matters.

00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:22.859
And you begin to find, listen, you don't even have to go to a lot of websites to find out

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:27.419
what churches believe on it. Just drive by their churches and you can see the signs.

00:38:27.419 --> 00:38:32.299
They just put it right out there. By the way, there's some Baptist churches that are flying

00:38:32.299 --> 00:38:39.019
flags that they shouldn't be flying, amen? It doesn't mean that we don't love people.

00:38:39.019 --> 00:38:46.459
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying. I preached this morning about loving. Listen, love never

00:38:46.459 --> 00:38:55.179
excuses sin. God's love is not a permissive love that I'm going to permit you to do whatever

00:38:55.179 --> 00:39:00.859
you want to do because I love you. No, God's love is a protective love. And because God

00:39:01.059 --> 00:39:04.779
loves us, He gives us the truth. And if we really love people, we need to tell them the

00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:11.779
truth. Because honestly, if we think about this this evening, if we cave in to the pressures

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:16.779
of our society, to the pressures of our culture, if we try to be accommodating and we set aside

00:39:16.779 --> 00:39:21.219
Bible truth and we just begin to tell people, hey, everything's going to be okay, you're

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:26.819
going to be just fine, just be sincere in what you believe, they're going to spend eternity

00:39:26.819 --> 00:39:33.899
in the lake of fire. Because it's not about being sincere in what they believe. It's about

00:39:33.899 --> 00:39:42.659
believing what Christ said, amen? And there's a great distinction between those two things.

00:39:42.659 --> 00:39:51.979
What about godly living? Again, culture or Bible. Does holiness matter? Does godly living

00:39:51.979 --> 00:39:59.019
matter? Sure it does. My Bible says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:01.219
Because He is holy.

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:05.699
And He said, be ye holy, for I am holy.

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:08.259
So holy living matters.

00:40:08.259 --> 00:40:10.379
Bible versions.

00:40:10.379 --> 00:40:11.779
Does it matter?

00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:13.259
Sure it does.

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:16.139
You know how many of the modern translations today

00:40:16.139 --> 00:40:19.259
are taking and attacking the person of Jesus Christ?

00:40:19.259 --> 00:40:20.659
The doctrine.

00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:22.899
So many people say, oh, the new modern translations,

00:40:22.899 --> 00:40:25.699
they're just trying to ease of readability.

00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:27.339
They're not really changing anything.

00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:29.819
I would challenge you to study it out.

00:40:29.819 --> 00:40:30.659
Study the verses.

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.179
This evening, we could go on and on.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:37.579
But I hope that just these things

00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:39.019
that I've shared with you tonight

00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:43.739
would help us understand why ecumenical separation is

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:45.219
so important.

00:40:45.219 --> 00:40:48.099
It's not enough for someone to say, I believe Jesus.

00:40:48.099 --> 00:40:49.099
OK, I believe Jesus too.

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:50.819
Let's go.

00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:53.059
No, there's a whole lot more.

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:55.979
And we must understand the doctrine, the faith that

00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:57.779
was delivered to us.

00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:00.859
And we're to earnestly contend for the faith.

00:41:00.859 --> 00:41:03.939
And so when we begin to try to reach people

00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:06.059
with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:41:06.059 --> 00:41:09.619
and we begin to partner with other groups of people

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:13.659
because we think that it's going to accomplish some greater

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:16.339
goal or greater accomplishment, and then we

00:41:16.339 --> 00:41:18.779
find out that that particular group of people

00:41:18.779 --> 00:41:21.459
is teaching something contrary to the word of God,

00:41:21.459 --> 00:41:25.259
what mass confusion is the result?

00:41:27.779 --> 00:41:29.899
Because we encourage people to read their Bibles,

00:41:29.899 --> 00:41:31.259
and to begin to read their Bible,

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:33.819
and to begin to see, well, this isn't really lined up here.

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:35.399
And that's not really lined up there.

00:41:35.399 --> 00:41:36.239
And what about this?

00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:38.139
And what about that?

00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:42.019
Are there people out there that we can fellowship with,

00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:43.659
associate with?

00:41:43.659 --> 00:41:44.379
Sure there are.

00:41:44.379 --> 00:41:46.979
There are people that we can associate with.

00:41:46.979 --> 00:41:48.779
But we must make sure that we do a test

00:41:48.779 --> 00:41:51.539
and make sure that they align with this book.

00:41:51.539 --> 00:41:52.819
And let me say this.

00:41:52.819 --> 00:41:57.059
At the same time, we must make sure we align with this book.

00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:58.499
Amen?

00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:00.899
We say that it's the sole authority for our faith

00:42:00.899 --> 00:42:02.059
and our practice.

00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:04.699
And we must make sure that we align with this book,

00:42:04.699 --> 00:42:07.819
that what we do is biblical, and that we're seeking

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:09.579
to please Him with our lives.

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:15.819
So can two walk together except they be agreed?

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:19.659
At what point along the journey does the division,

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:24.979
does the difference matter enough?

00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:31.179
What Bible teaching would you be OK with just marking out

00:42:31.179 --> 00:42:33.499
of your Bible, saying, OK, I'm going to take that,

00:42:33.499 --> 00:42:35.659
and I'm going to just put that aside.

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:39.259
Because for the sake of whatever,

00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:43.859
we're going to be willing to, man, this book is precious.

00:42:43.859 --> 00:42:50.779
And God said every word is pure, every word.

00:42:50.779 --> 00:42:56.099
I'm not going to take a pen knife or a Sharpie

00:42:56.099 --> 00:43:00.259
and start removing things from my Bible.

00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:03.219
We have to stand on the truth.

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:03.899
Amen?

00:43:03.899 --> 00:43:05.819
Listen, it doesn't make us better.

00:43:05.819 --> 00:43:08.019
It shouldn't result in pride.

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:10.459
I am humbled.

00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:16.979
I am humbled that God allowed me to receive the truth,

00:43:16.979 --> 00:43:19.459
honestly.

00:43:19.459 --> 00:43:24.619
And I am not only humbled, but we have been entrusted,

00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:27.939
and we are responsible to give the truth.

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:30.819
It's not about a group of people sitting back and saying,

00:43:30.819 --> 00:43:33.299
we're right, everybody else is wrong.

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:36.259
No, that's the wrong approach.

00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:39.379
God's been so gracious to give me truth.

00:43:39.379 --> 00:43:42.299
And now I want to give that truth to those

00:43:42.299 --> 00:43:44.579
that He would allow me to come in contact with.

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:45.379
Let's pray together.

00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:47.179
Father, we love you.

00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:48.739
We thank you for loving us.

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:50.859
We thank you for the word of God and for the truth

00:43:50.859 --> 00:43:51.619
contained therein.

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:56.739
We thank you for those things and sound words, the faith,

00:43:56.739 --> 00:43:59.459
doctrine, sound doctrine.

00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:01.899
Lord, we thank you so much for the word of God.

00:44:01.899 --> 00:44:04.219
I pray that you would help us this evening, Lord,

00:44:04.219 --> 00:44:08.099
in this moment of invitation, that we would just

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:12.259
rejoice in the fact that you've given us truth.

00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:15.499
And then, God, I pray that you'd help us to be burdened,

00:44:15.499 --> 00:44:17.739
to share that truth with others.

00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:20.219
I pray that you'd move and work in the hearts of your people

00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:22.019
as only you can, and we'll thank you for it.

00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:23.099
In Christ's name, we pray.

00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:24.379
Would you stand with me?

00:44:24.379 --> 00:44:25.779
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:27.939
We'll have a moment of invitation this evening.

00:44:27.939 --> 00:44:29.819
And Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:31.939
And as she does, maybe you want to visit this altar

00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:34.179
and thank God for the truth, for the sound words

00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:35.619
that he's given us.

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:37.059
Maybe you want to ask God to help

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:40.219
you to be faithful, to give that truth to others.

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:43.299
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
