1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Dealing with great levels of difficulty, of course

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,920
We understand that after David was used by God and God enabled him to defeat Goliath

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:13,880
that of course there were some other battles with the Philistines and

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:21,239
David was recognized by several within the the ranks of Israel as being a wise person

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:21,559
of course

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,280
the women were singing his praises and they said something of this nature that Saul had slain his

7
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:34,959
Thousands, but David his ten thousands and of course Saul as the king didn't like that a whole lot and of

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,959
Saul sought

9
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:42,919
Continually to kill David and so over this portion of Scripture in this section of 1st

10
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,319
Samuel you see often where David is fleeing

11
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:50,720
From the dangers of Saul and how God is working miraculously on his behalf

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,799
And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening

13
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,159
we're gonna look focus for the the main thought of the lesson from verses 16 through 18 and

14
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:05,559
Somebody read that passage and then we'll get into the lesson this evening. The Bible says in Jonathan Saul's son arose and

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,519
went to David into the wood and

16
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:11,959
strengthened his hand in God

17
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,639
And he said unto him fear not

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,879
For the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over Israel and I shall be next unto thee

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,879
and that also saw my father knoweth

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,879
they too made a covenant before the Lord and David abode in the wood and

21
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,839
Jonathan went to his house

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:41,440
Again, if you will a lesson within a lesson really the thought of 1st Samuel 23 as we look throughout this passage of Scripture

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,400
You find that it begins with the Philistines attacking the city of Keilah

24
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,400
The Bible begins in verse number one and says then they told David saying behold the Philistines fight against Keilah

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,519
And they robbed the threshing floors

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,680
And so we find that David is made aware of the situation with the Philistines

27
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:01,260
Attacking the city of Keilah and David inquires of the Lord

28
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:08,479
He seeks the face of God he and his men go to Keilah and they provide deliverance from the Philistines

29
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
I mean, that's a wonderful

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,520
passage of Scripture the first five verses

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,360
I mean you think about the victory that they experienced you think about the

32
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:22,399
The joy that was in that city and amongst those people when they experienced the victory of the Lord and how God's

33
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,360
guidance and leadership

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,520
Gave them the direction that they needed for that particular time, but we find that the Bible tells us

35
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,119
that they

36
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:38,679
After they experienced victory that Saul was aware of what was taking place

37
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,240
In fact, if you read in verse number seven

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,580
You find that Saul was going to seize the opportunity if you will

39
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:51,440
To go and get David and we know that he wanted them dead in verse number seven

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,919
The Bible says and it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah and Saul said God hath delivered him into mine hand

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,160
For he has shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,960
So what does Saul do he gathers the people of war together according to verse number eight and they were gonna go down to Keilah to

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,559
Besiege David and his men. It's interesting that Saul was not the one he and his men

44
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,440
they didn't come to help Keilah from the Philistines and

45
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:26,240
We find that it was David and his men that went to the city to help deliver

46
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,160
These inhabitants from the attack of the Philistines

47
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:34,240
But now when Saul hears word that David is in this city

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,399
And he looks at as being a grave mistake for he's shut in

49
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:41,880
He's in a city a town that hath gates and bars

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,979
And so Saul is going to seize his opportunity to finally get David

51
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,360
We find that David inquires of the Lord

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,919
he asked the Lord two simple questions as

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,399
We look at the first really twelve verses of this passage of Scripture to really set the scene for what's going on

54
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:04,440
And he asked two questions number one. He asked the Lord is Saul going to come

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,619
See David had heard that Saul he'd heard about the plan that Saul had devised and that Saul was going to come and so David

56
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:19,399
Inquires and he asked specifically of the Lord is Saul going to come you can read of that in verse number 11 and you find that

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,239
God answers the specific request notice. It says will the men of Keilah

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,079
Deliver me into his hand will Saul come down as my servant hath heard and the Bible tells us that the Lord God of Israel

59
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,799
Gives an answer at the end of verse number 11. It says the Lord said he will

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,920
Come down

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,500
The second question that David asked and really it was posed first in verse number 11

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,720
But it's addressed second and the answer is given in verse number 12

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,239
And that question was this whether or not the men of Keilah would deliver him and his men into the hand of Saul

64
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,279
the Bible says that

65
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,160
God answered again at verse number 12 at the end. It says the Lord said they will

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,600
Deliver thee up now. Can you imagine put yourself just for a moment in the shoes of David?

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,480
Understand the circumstances that are going on

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,079
I'm trying to set the scene this evening to help us understand really the condition in which David has found himself

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,920
He goes and he delivers this city from the Philistines

70
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:26,920
While he's experiencing victory and there's a level of joy. He hears about this plan of Saul

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,279
he's gathered up the men of war and they're going to come together for the purpose of besieging David as men and

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,839
David says God is he gonna come and are these people gonna deliver me into his hand and God says yes

73
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,000
He's coming and yes, they will deliver you into his hand

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Now you might have a different expectation of what the inhabitants of Keilah would do for you after you did for them

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Right. I mean, is that a fair assessment?

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,760
David and his men they went they fought against the Philistines

77
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,160
They're the ones that brought victory to the city of Keilah

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,399
But yet these men these inhabitants of this town this city Keilah when they find that Saul is coming

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,399
no, they're gonna deliver David and

80
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,959
His men and we find that as we look at the really the main emphasis of the story that rate within the lesson is

81
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,559
A lesson that I want to focus on this evening. We've read the verses of Scripture already in verses 16 through 18

82
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,320
Let me read verse 16 again

83
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,239
Give you the title and we'll get into the message

84
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:31,760
The Bible says and Jonathan saw son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I've simply entitled the message this evening

86
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,679
Jonathan strengthened

87
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,440
David's hand

88
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Jonathan strengthened

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,720
David's hand, you know, the reality is that there are times in which we're all in need of encouragement

90
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,320
We're all in need of someone to help strengthen us encourage us

91
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,079
And we find that David was in a situation here where he was being hunted

92
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,559
In fact, the Bible tells us in verse number 14 of the passage of Scripture that Saul saw him David

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Everyday, can you imagine?

94
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:11,440
David had earlier made this confession that there was but a step between him and death

95
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,519
Saul was serious about his

96
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,079
agenda to kill David

97
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,359
Dave was in this position

98
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:23,839
And so as we look at the passage and we think about the fact that Jonathan strengthened David's hand

99
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,480
I want you to consider just two thoughts this evening. Number one is this

100
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,079
Jonathan was aware of the situation

101
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,600
Jonathan was aware of the situation

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,480
The Bible tells us in verse number eight and Saul called all the people together to war

103
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,640
To go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men early on

104
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,760
We find that Saul tried to keep his motive secret as to what he wanted to do to David

105
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,640
we find that early on in 1st Samuel chapter number 18, in fact when

106
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,760
Saul has this idea that he was going to send David out to war and thinking that David would fall by one of the hands

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,320
Of the Philistines when Saul had the idea that he was gonna make David his son-in-law

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
He's gonna give his daughter in marriage

109
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,600
he requested of the the dowry if you will and he thought that

110
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,760
David would be killed by the Philistines that he would fall by the hand of the Philistines

111
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,880
We find that Saul kind of had this secretive agenda

112
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,920
If you will early on on his desire to see David killed

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Of course, we know that he threw the javelin and tried to kill David on more than one occasion in chapter number 19

114
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:37,000
as you kind of progress through the situation and really think about what Jonathan was aware of we

115
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Understand that they had this friendship

116
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,559
In fact, let me read a couple of verses before we get into chapter 19 in chapter 18 in verses 1

117
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,119
Really 1 through 4 the Bible says and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul

118
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,559
That the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David

119
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,119
Jonathan loved him as his own soul and Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house

120
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:08,840
It says this in verse 3 then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul

121
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,159
And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to a sword and to

122
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,840
His bow bow bow, excuse me and to his girdle

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,460
We find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

124
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,359
We begin to think about this

125
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:31,359
friendship that had been developed over the years between these two men and we find that that Jonathan was aware of the situation for this

126
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,080
Is what said in chapter 19 after?

127
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,039
those events in chapter 18 when Saul had kept his

128
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,960
Agenda his motive secret in verse 19 and verse 1 of chapter 19

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,400
It says in Saul spake to Jonathan his son and to all his servants notice this that they should kill David

130
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,960
Saul's plan in chapter 18 his secret agenda didn't come to pass and so now Jonathan is made aware of this in fact in

131
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,360
chapter 19 Jonathan says to his father what why what has he done I mean you saw

132
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,840
how that God used him to provide deliverance in fact in verse number five

133
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,400
it says for he did put his life in his hand and slew the Philistine and the

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,040
Lord brought a great salvation for all Israel thou sawest it and did rejoice

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,000
wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay David without a

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,800
cause this particular time in verse number six Saul hearkened under the

137
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,160
voice of Jonathan and Saul swear as the Lord liveth he shall not be slain so

138
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
David is brought back into the presence of Saul and shortly thereafter we find

139
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,760
that David was playing with his hand in verse number nine and John Saul was

140
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,480
there with a javelin in his hand and what did he do in verse number 10 Saul

141
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin he slipped away out of

142
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,680
Saul's presence he's delivered by his wife and we see all sorts of things

143
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,400
taking place and it's in chapter number 20 when we find that as David and

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,320
Jonathan devised this plan as to how he would determine if there was ill set

145
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,680
against him that the Bible tells us after their event there they're really

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,960
their plan that they came up with David of course was not going to be there to

147
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,880
eat his place would be empty and the Bible tells us in chapter 20 in verse

148
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,960
number 30 that Saul's anger was kindled now against Jonathan the Bible says that

149
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,920
he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not I know

150
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and under the

151
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,200
confusion of thy mother's nakedness for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon

152
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,840
the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,280
fetch him unto me for he shall surely die Jonathan then answered his father

154
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,560
look at what he says in verse 32 he said to him wherefore shall he be slain what

155
00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:01,320
hath he done so Saul then cast a javelin at Jonathan it says this and Saul cast a

156
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,680
javelin at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of

157
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,960
his father to slay David so he was aware of the situation chapters 21 and 22

158
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,600
provide us some events in the life of David when he's seeking refuge he is

159
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,760
delivered by the priest of Himalaya and of course Doeg one of the servants of

160
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Saul was there and he heard about what's going on and in all of the slaughter of

161
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,000
the Levites in that passage in his his family and we come to the 23rd chapter

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,840
and as David is there at Keilah and now the Bible tells us that Saul called all

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,940
the people together to war he was gonna go down and so this man Jonathan he was

164
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,540
aware of the situation he was aware of what was going on he was aware of the

165
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,300
plan of his father he was aware of the situation of David no doubt in my mind

166
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,260
because of the friendship that had been developed over the years between these

167
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,460
two men and their experiences together that the Bible tells us that Jonathan

168
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:05,300
loved David as his own soul so we find that Jonathan has a level of concern and

169
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,700
compassion for David we find that he's aware of the situation there are times

170
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,940
in our lives where we may be aware of something where someone is going through

171
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,420
a difficulty there's some hardship some trial some difficulty that someone is

172
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,620
going through and we're aware of the situation being aware of the situation

173
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,780
is good but we got to do something about it and that's where we find as we really

174
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,700
look at the passage of Scripture we find first of all that he was aware of the

175
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,300
situation number two notice this that Jonathan took action to strengthen David

176
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,780
he did something about it I want you to consider what's taking place I want to

177
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,100
consider with me this evening really the the risk that Jonathan was taking upon

178
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,380
his own life I mean in chapter number 20 when he stood before his father Saul and

179
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,020
said what has he done we find that Jonathan is the one now that's having a

180
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:05,420
javelin thrown at him so Jonathan is going to go and we find that Saul is

181
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,980
seeking David at this particular time because David was diligent to seek

182
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,620
counsel from the Lord and he found out that yes all is coming and yes these

183
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,740
people are going to deliver you into his hand what did David do they got out the

184
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,660
Bible tells us in verse 13 then David is men which were about 600 arose and

185
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,340
departed out of Keylon went whithersoever they could go and it was

186
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,180
told Saul that David was escaped from Keyla and he forbear to go forth and so

187
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,660
the Bible tells us in verse number 14 that David abode in the wilderness and

188
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,820
strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Zipf and Saul sought

189
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,540
him every day but God delivered him not into his hand thank God for his

190
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,580
protection and what a blessing that is the Bible says in verse 15 and David

191
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,460
saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David was in the wilderness of

192
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:07,060
Zipf in a wood we find that he's in this place he's being sought teen as men and

193
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,300
we find that the Bible tells us in verse 16 and Jonathan Saul's son arose notice

194
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,100
what it says and went to David what did he do he went to David in the place

195
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,980
where David was the Bible says that he went to David into the wood he found

196
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,620
where David was and he went to him David was in a situation here we know later on

197
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,900
in the book of 1st Samuel as you would come to the 30th chapter of this book

198
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,940
you find that David is in a situation where he returns from the potential of

199
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,740
going into battle and he returns to the city of Ziklag and he finds that the

200
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,540
Amalekites had come in and had taken captive all of the family and they'd

201
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,060
taken everything and David was greatly distressed and there in that passage the

202
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,700
Bible tells us that David encouraged himself in the Lord but in this

203
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,540
particular occasion in 1st Samuel chapter 23 we find that Jonathan was

204
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:13,020
used of the Lord to come to where David was and to strengthen his hand in God to

205
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:20,620
encourage him I think about the joy that must have filled David's heart and

206
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,340
soul at the sight of Jonathan can you imagine we've quickly gone through

207
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,100
several chapters of references from chapter 18 through 20 to help us to

208
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,900
understand this relationship that had developed between Jonathan and David

209
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,540
this friendship this godly friendship and we find that now as David is being

210
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,540
hunted and he's going from place to place and he's there in the wood in

211
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,100
this wilderness of Zipf what a joy to see the face of Jonathan have you ever seen

212
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,700
someone that maybe not seen for a while and man there's just a great sense of

213
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,020
joy that fills your heart upon the sight of that individual they're coming for

214
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,140
the purpose of encouraging and strengthening you we find that Jonathan

215
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:16,060
comes not only do we notice what he did but we notice what he said in verse

216
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,620
number 17 the Bible records for us really this brief encounter that

217
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,460
Jonathan has with David this brief opportunity that he has he sees the

218
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,380
opportunity to encourage his friend to strengthen his friend notice he says

219
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,860
unto him number one fear not fear not now typically you tell someone to fear

220
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,060
not because you sense that there might be a sense of fear right I mean if I

221
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,900
show up and you look like man everything's going great I mean

222
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,540
everything's wonderful and you're enjoying great victory if I greet you by

223
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,060
saying fear not you're gonna be like what is he talking about why does he

224
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,220
get the idea that I'm afraid right you understand but when we can can you sense

225
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,860
when someone's afraid sure you can there are times and situations in which we can

226
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,020
see on the countenance of an individual that there is something that has caused

227
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,020
them a level of fear there's something that's going on and the Bible tells us

228
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,180
as we go through the passages amazing passage of Scripture here in first

229
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,140
Samuel 23 but as we look at the lesson within the lesson we think about this

230
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,220
moment of time in which Jonathan comes and encourages David the Bible says that

231
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,220
he says fear not no notice what he says for the hand of Saul my father shall not

232
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,740
find thee is it interesting to you how easy it was for Jonathan to find David

233
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:52,860
and yet Saul was not able to find David he saw him in fact as we look through it

234
00:18:52,860 --> 00:19:00,420
says that he sought him every day he saw him every day but God delivered him

235
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,740
not into his hand what a blessing we find that Jonathan comes and he shows up

236
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,980
and he says to David is he's there in his presence he says fear not for the

237
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,860
hand of Saul my father shall not find thee then he tells him this and thou

238
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:22,220
shalt be king over Israel see Jonathan understood the plan Jonathan understood

239
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,540
what God was doing Saul no doubt was aware of it even as Jonathan mentions

240
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,059
here at the latter part of verse number 17 that Saul also was aware of this plan

241
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,140
remember that it was back before David ever was anointed to be king of Israel

242
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,380
that God through Samuel had told Saul that God has rejected you from being

243
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,179
king see Saul had been disobedient we find that there's occasion in which he

244
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,460
did not wait as he was supposed to he did not obey in the manner in which he

245
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:01,780
was to obey and we find that Samuel had to deliver that message to Saul that

246
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,500
He was rejected by God.

247
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,120
I do not believe that Samuel

248
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,880
enjoyed delivering that message,

249
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,140
for the Bible tells us that Samuel mourned for Saul.

250
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,920
In fact, as you come to the first verse

251
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,180
of 1 Samuel 16,

252
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
the Bible says,

253
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,140
"...And the Lord said unto Samuel,

254
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,380
How long wilt thou mourn for Saul?

255
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,720
Seeing I have rejected him

256
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,420
from reigning over Israel.

257
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,760
Fill thine horn with oil,

258
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,360
and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite,

259
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,980
for I have provided me a king among his sons."

260
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,640
Who is that? It's David.

261
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,800
And so Jonathan reveals to David,

262
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
now I want you to understand,

263
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,040
a man that's on the run,

264
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
a man that's been hunted now

265
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,580
for a number of chapters

266
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,540
as recorded here in the book of 1 Samuel,

267
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,780
he's delivered at the end of chapter 18.

268
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,920
We find that there's the truth

269
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,420
of what Saul's trying to do.

270
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,560
He then makes it broadly known

271
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,920
in chapter 19,

272
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,780
he's delivered by his wife

273
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,420
and protected by Samuel.

274
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,380
And we find that as you go through

275
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,000
chapters 19, 20, 21, 22,

276
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,060
that David's on the run.

277
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,280
And you find that he says to Jonathan

278
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,960
at one particular occasion,

279
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,360
there's but a step between me and death.

280
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,820
And we think about understanding

281
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,840
that's there in 1 Samuel 20

282
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,940
in v. 3, the latter part of the verse,

283
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,580
but truly as the Lord liveth

284
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,760
and as thy soul liveth,

285
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,440
there's but a step between me and death.

286
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,560
If you're in that situation,

287
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,000
if you're considering the fact

288
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,380
that you're being hunted,

289
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,800
as you're considering the fact

290
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
that there's but a step between you and death,

291
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,920
the thought of being king of Israel

292
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,220
is not really close on your mind.

293
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,920
Right?

294
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,340
What does Jonathan do?

295
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,100
He reminds him of God's promises.

296
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,860
He reminds him of God's plan.

297
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,300
Jonathan comes to David.

298
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,180
He comes to the place where he is.

299
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,940
It says that he arose and he went

300
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,360
to David into the wood.

301
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,000
Strengthened his hand in God.

302
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
He tells him to fear not.

303
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,020
He then tells him that Saul's not going to find him.

304
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,520
He reminds him of the plan and promise of God.

305
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,260
He says, thou shalt be king over Israel.

306
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,800
If God has ordained it that you're going

307
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,360
to be king over Israel, and He has,

308
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,660
and we know that you've been anointed to be king,

309
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,900
you're not king yet,

310
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,260
so you know that God is going to protect you.

311
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,420
He's going to provide for you.

312
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,400
Can you imagine the encouragement?

313
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,320
See, there are times in our lives,

314
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,600
thinking about the life of Jonathan,

315
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,640
but also thinking about the life of David,

316
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,940
there are times in our lives

317
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,640
when we're in a situation,

318
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,840
we're dealing with a level of circumstances

319
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,960
and a difficulty in which we might think

320
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,360
it's helpless.

321
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,980
It's hopeless.

322
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,280
We're not thinking properly.

323
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,940
We're in a place where we're not thinking properly

324
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
because of a circumstance,

325
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
a situation that you're dealing with,

326
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
and somebody's able to come alongside of you

327
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,500
and remind you of some of what God's plan is,

328
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,320
some of what God's promises are.

329
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
It may not be that you have forgotten them entirely

330
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,860
or completely,

331
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,740
but it's just not fresh on your mind

332
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,680
because you're dealing with all of these circumstances

333
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,400
and all of these adverse situations

334
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
that you're dealing with,

335
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,760
and you say, I'm overwhelmed with these things.

336
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,180
In fact, many of the psalms in which you read

337
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,480
where David is crying out

338
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,260
and saying, how long, O Lord?

339
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,160
When David's crying out and saying

340
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,340
that his heart is overwhelmed,

341
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,220
many of those psalms are penned

342
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
during this period of time of the book of 1 Samuel

343
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,020
when he's on the run.

344
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
And I can't help but think about

345
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,500
the encouragement of Jonathan

346
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,660
in this passage of Scripture.

347
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,840
It's a lesson within the lesson.

348
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,460
And think about the impact that it made

349
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,120
on David's life in this very moment of time.

350
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,600
The Bible says in v. 17,

351
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,120
"...and I shall be next unto thee,

352
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,240
and that also saw my father knoweth."

353
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,080
The Bible tells us in v. 18,

354
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,280
"...and they too made a covenant before the Lord,

355
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,680
and David abode in the wood,

356
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,240
and Jonathan went to his house."

357
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,380
Jonathan couldn't stay where David was,

358
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:33,020
but he risked whatever the cost would be,

359
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,260
perhaps his life,

360
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,860
to go to where David was

361
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,180
to encourage him, to strengthen him.

362
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
As I think about this passage of Scripture

363
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,020
and I think about the truth that

364
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,980
Jonathan strengthened David's hand,

365
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,180
I wonder this evening,

366
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,600
whose hand is it that God has for us to strengthen?

367
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,560
Who is it that God may allow us

368
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,400
to have some knowledge of a circumstance

369
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
or situation that they're dealing with

370
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,480
and God may use us to go and strengthen their hand?

371
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,640
That we would take action.

372
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,960
See, Jonathan was aware of the situation,

373
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,280
but Jonathan took action.

374
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,800
He did something about it.

375
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,240
He was willing to go into the presence

376
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,660
to risk maybe even his own life.

377
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,220
Do you think that Saul would have been pleased

378
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,060
to know that Jonathan was going to find where David was?

379
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,460
No, this is a dangerous situation.

380
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,780
Jonathan had already been in the presence of Saul once

381
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,160
when Saul took a javelin and threw it at him.

382
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,860
We find that Jonathan said,

383
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,780
I need to go encourage my friend.

384
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,960
I need to go and strengthen his hand in God.

385
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,900
He was aware of what was going on.

386
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,700
And this situation with David was again,

387
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
a number of passages of Scripture,

388
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,300
chapters that we read of this ongoing drama

389
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,620
that David is facing

390
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,980
and all of this difficulty that he's dealing with.

391
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,500
And we find that he comes and they make this covenant

392
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,700
and then David stays there in the wood

393
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,300
and Jonathan returns to his house.

394
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,100
As I think about this passage of Scripture

395
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
and think about the role of Jonathan,

396
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm reminded of what the Bible tells us about Job.

397
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,960
Go over to Job 4 if you will.

398
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,240
Now, often we think about the book of Job.

399
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,080
We think about all of the difficulty that Job encountered

400
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,360
and certainly he had some great difficulty.

401
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,100
You read there in Job 1

402
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
and you read of all the things that befell him

403
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,600
and you read into chapter 2

404
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,920
and see how that it continues to just increase.

405
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,040
And the Bible tells us that he had some friends

406
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,380
at the end of chapter 2 that were going to go

407
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,140
and they were going to come and they sought to bring comfort.

408
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,860
And of course, we know that later in the book of Job,

409
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,840
that Job will describe his friends

410
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,300
as being miserable comforters.

411
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,100
But I want you to consider what is said of Job

412
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,760
in Job 4.

413
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,560
In verse 3, it says,

414
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Behold, thou hast instructed many,

415
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,580
and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

416
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,040
Thy words have upheld in him that was falling,

417
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,800
and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

418
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,460
Job was a man that was used of God to encourage many.

419
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,340
To strengthen them.

420
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,160
We see it in verses 3 and 4 here of Job 4.

421
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,560
And of course, we find that it goes into the fact

422
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,460
that now Job is in that position

423
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,660
where he needs the encouragement.

424
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,540
He's dealt with some tragedy, some difficulty,

425
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,960
and now he needs the encouragement.

426
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,620
And no doubt, there are times in our lives

427
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,660
where we need encouragement,

428
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,660
but this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture

429
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,380
and we consider what's going on in the life of David,

430
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,020
and we say, thank the Lord

431
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,600
that Jonathan was sensitive to the need

432
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,820
and Jonathan was willing to take action and go

433
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,600
and strengthen the hand of David.

434
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,680
And I just wonder this evening,

435
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,520
I think about the New Testament.

436
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I think about many throughout the portions of Scripture

437
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,160
that were used to be encouragers.

438
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,480
Barnabas is probably one of the first examples

439
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,960
that would come to our mind

440
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,000
as one that was an encourager.

441
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,280
No doubt, he encouraged Paul on a number of occasions.

442
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,800
We find that as we would look throughout the Scriptures

443
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,520
and we think about those that came

444
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
and there were several that Paul would mention

445
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
how they refreshed me.

446
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,520
They oft refreshed me

447
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,480
and how these individuals were used by the Lord

448
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,040
to go and to seek him out,

449
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,440
to seek to encourage him and to strengthen him.

450
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,920
This evening, David was in a difficult situation.

451
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,920
God delivered him

452
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,160
just as Jonathan had given him the encouragement.

453
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,600
God worked miraculously.

454
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,360
If you read the end of 1 Samuel 23,

455
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,560
you find that just as David and his men

456
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,840
are completely surrounded by Saul and his men,

457
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,560
that the Bible tells us that there came a messenger to Saul

458
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,440
and said the Philistines have invaded the land

459
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,920
and we find that Saul and his men

460
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,880
have to retreat and go take care of that

461
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,680
and God miraculously delivers David and his men.

462
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,640
And what a blessing.

463
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
But in the midst of the trial,

464
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Jonathan comes and strengthened his hand in God.

465
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,600
This evening, is there someone that God might want you

466
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
to encourage, to strengthen?

467
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
Are we looking for that opportunity?

468
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,960
No doubt there are times you say,

469
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
pastor, I hear what you're saying,

470
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,400
but I'm the one that needs encouragement.

471
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,960
Sometimes it's easy for us to look at things that way.

472
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
Amen?

473
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,720
We're all dealing with difficulties

474
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,400
and I'm not trying to discount those difficulties.

475
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm simply saying that God could use you

476
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,360
to be an encouragement to someone else,

477
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,320
to strengthen someone else.

478
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,160
their truth from His Word,

479
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,460
to be able to strengthen their faith

480
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,140
to continue on.

481
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,720
I can only imagine

482
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,800
how David must have felt

483
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,520
at the sight of Jonathan.

484
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm sure it was refreshing.

485
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,360
It was encouraging.

486
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,640
Just him coming.

487
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,960
And then as they sat there

488
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,520
and they talked

489
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,640
and Jonathan shared these truths,

490
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,760
reminded David,

491
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,280
God has a plan for you, David.

492
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,160
You're going to be the king.

493
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,080
We find that David was strengthened

494
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,440
by Jonathan.

495
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,600
Oh, that God would use us in like fashion.

496
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,240
Let's pray.

497
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,560
Father, we love You this evening.

498
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,940
We thank You for loving us.

499
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,800
Lord, we thank You for the encouragement

500
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,560
that You give us through Thy Word.

501
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,920
We thank You for the examples

502
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,600
that we're able to read of.

503
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
We believe in this particular account

504
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,440
here this evening of Jonathan

505
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
being aware of the situation,

506
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,120
but then taking action

507
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,520
to go to where David was

508
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,000
to speak to him,

509
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,880
to encourage him,

510
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,040
to strengthen him.

511
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,400
God, this evening, I pray,

512
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,640
You'd help us to be sensitive

513
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,160
to the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God

514
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
in our lives.

515
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
Help us, God, to be used of Thee.

516
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,000
Help us to encourage and strengthen

517
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,720
the brethren.

518
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
I pray that You would bless our time of prayer.

519
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,480
We thank You for the privilege of prayer.

520
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,240
We pray that You'd be honored and glorified

521
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,360
through all that's said and done.

522
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,040
For it's in Christ's name we pray,

523
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,800
Amen.
