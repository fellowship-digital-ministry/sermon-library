1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,739
I'll be finishing up this chapter this evening, verses 22 through 34.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:10,079
And this is our 55th lesson through the book of Genesis.

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,739
And we have been just kind of slowly making our way through this book.

4
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:20,659
Of course, the first 11 chapters, we spent many, many weeks, months, in fact, looking

5
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,899
at those foundational truths.

6
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:29,340
And I often said, as we were studying those 11 chapters, how that the enemy seeks to attack

7
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:36,459
that portion of Scripture and the creation account and all that's contained within the

8
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,779
first several chapters of the book of Genesis.

9
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:44,979
Because if they can attack and cause doubt with regard to the foundation, then the rest

10
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,779
can kind of crumble.

11
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:50,500
And I am thankful that God's Word has been given to us.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
And God's Word is sure, and it stands, it's profitable.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,060
And I'm thankful for what God teaches us.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,560
As we study this 21st chapter, we find that it begins with that miraculous birth of Isaac.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,080
Remember, the Lord had made many promises to Abraham with regard to a seed, a son.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,120
And we find that it begins in verse number one, and it says, the Lord visited Sarah,

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,400
notice, as he said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,739
God always does what he says he will do.

19
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,779
And we find that though there was a period of waiting and though this oft-repeated promise

20
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:34,660
that was made to Abraham seemed as if it was far off, we find that it was fulfilled in

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,279
the beginning of this chapter, chapter 21 of the book of Genesis.

22
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:45,160
We find that after this miraculous birth, we find that the child grew and was weaned

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
and Abraham made a great feast.

24
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:56,099
Throughout that process, we noticed how that, of course, Hagar and Ishmael were cast out.

25
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,160
And these things, according to what Paul says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,639
God in the book of Galatians, these things are an allegory.

27
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:08,520
The truth that was taught to us, that the Spirit and the flesh, they're at enmity one

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,360
with the other, and you had to cast out Hagar and Ishmael.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,740
And just like as believers, we must put off the old man.

30
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,020
We must put off and crucify the flesh.

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,520
We find now that as we enter into this final section of the book of this chapter, the book

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,300
of Genesis, chapter 21, we find here that there is an interaction that is recorded between

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,160
Abimelech, Phicol, the chief captain of his host, and Abraham.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,740
It's really an interesting dialogue that takes place, an interesting event that is

35
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,960
given to us, and I believe that as we end the chapter, you'll find it's interesting

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,279
to note how that Abraham is worshiping the Lord.

37
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:58,639
As we begin looking at this passage of Scripture, we find in verse 22, the Bible says,

38
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,679
"...and it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the chief captain of

39
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,039
his host, spake unto Abraham, saying..."

40
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:13,559
Notice this phrase, "...God is with thee in all that thou doest."

41
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,919
I mentioned this morning as we were dealing with the subject matter of our behavior in

42
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,919
the workplace, how there was such a connection between that passage of Scripture and what

43
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,399
our behavior is to look like, and what we find here with this description, this observation,

44
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:36,880
if you will, that is given of Abraham from Abimelech, "...God is with thee in all that

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
thou doest."

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,960
I've taken that phrase from verse 22 to use as our title this evening.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,119
And if you're taking notes, I want you to see first the perception of Abimelech.

48
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,279
The perception of Abimelech.

49
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:51,720
I want to remind you of the interaction back in Genesis chapter number 20.

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,600
If you go back to chapter number 20, we find that the Bible tells us about Abraham taking

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
a journey.

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,639
This is the second time in which this same type of situation occurs.

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,240
The first time was back in previous chapter, and we looked and studied that and understood

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,440
what was going on.

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,960
But here as we come to the 20th chapter of the book of Genesis, we find that this is

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,380
the first encounter between Abraham and Abimelech.

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,119
There are some Bible scholars that doubt that this is the same Abimelech in chapter 21 as

58
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,000
we find in chapter number 20.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
I tend to believe that it's the same Abimelech.

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,600
I believe that there's credibility with regard to the account, but there's also indication

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,320
as to why it is that Abimelech would desire to do and to have this covenant with Abraham

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,679
that we'll read of in just a moment based on what we see in chapter number 20.

63
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:47,799
But it's here in chapter number 20, you'll remember that Abraham operated in fear.

64
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,640
Abraham went into this place, he was going to sojourn, and he goes in.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,079
And remember, he says that Sarah is my sister.

66
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,559
And this is a recurring situation for Abraham, and we find that Abraham in this particular

67
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:07,760
situation, he'd done it back in chapter number 12 when he goes into Egypt with Pharaoh.

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,279
And now in chapter number 20, he does it again.

69
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,600
And we find that he was operating under fear, but yet God displayed his power.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm thankful that our God is omnipotent.

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,959
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

72
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,679
And we find here that God says, notice in chapter 20 in verse number 3, but God came

73
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:32,160
to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, behold, thou art but a dead man.

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,279
For the woman which thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife.

75
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,559
Now can you imagine that kind of a greeting?

76
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:47,279
Abimelech was operating under what was supposedly social norms for him to be able to take this

77
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,279
Sarah.

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,640
Again, it's a different environment than what we live in, but with understanding the times

79
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,239
and what was going on, Abraham says, she's my sister, and Abimelech says, man, I'm going

80
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:03,480
to take her, and God says, you're but a dead man.

81
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,640
What a greeting, what an interaction.

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,200
But Abimelech in verse number 4 had not come near her, and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay

83
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,799
also a righteous nation?

84
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:19,040
He said, he nodded unto me, she is my sister, and she, even she herself said, he is my brother.

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,119
In the integrity of my heart and in the innocency of my hands have I done this, and God said

86
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:28,239
unto him in a dream, yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart,

87
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:33,880
for I also withheld thee from sinning against me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
her.

89
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,920
Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee,

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
and thou shalt live.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,559
And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are

92
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,600
thine.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,679
Wow.

94
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:55,079
We studied this in great detail when we looked at this passage of Scripture, but just by

95
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,399
way of remembering and understanding the backdrop to what we're reading now in chapter 21, and

96
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,519
you think about this Abimelech, and you think about how God demonstrated His power and how

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,440
God shows up to him in a dream at night and tells him that he's but a dead man, and then

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,079
says I understand these are the things that you've done, but I want you to know that you're

99
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,040
to restore the man his wife.

100
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,359
And notice what God says in verse number 7, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for

101
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,279
thee, and thou shalt live.

102
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,200
And then He tells him if you choose not to obey, you're going to die.

103
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,920
He says that if thou restore her not, know thou, know thou, that thou shalt surely die,

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,119
thou and all that are thine.

105
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,119
You know what Abimelech does?

106
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,119
He believes God.

107
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,679
He really does.

108
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:45,160
It says then Abimelech rose early in the morning.

109
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,000
You wonder why he rose early in the morning?

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,559
Because he believed what God said.

111
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,720
Amen?

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,000
And he rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,600
in their ears, and the men were sore afraid.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:08,480
We find that Abimelech took and restored Sarah, and we find that as he obeyed the Lord

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,440
and he restored Sarah, the Bible tells us that Abraham prayed for him.

116
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,119
God said that would happen in verse number 7.

117
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:21,040
He says that he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,200
Notice with me in verse number 17, the Bible says, so Abraham prayed unto God, and God

119
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,000
healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, and they bared children, for the Lord had

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,799
fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

121
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,559
Now we leave that account in chapter number 20, and we begin to read in chapter number

122
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,479
21 of the birth of Isaac and the growth of Isaac, the weaning of Isaac, the casting out

123
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:54,119
of Hagar and Ishmael, and then the Bible comes back in verse 22 and says, and it came to

124
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:58,840
pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicole, the chief captain of his host, spake unto

125
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,760
Abraham saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,320
As we think about this observation, the perception of Abimelech, I do not believe that this is

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
just Abimelech acting in some level of flattery.

128
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,679
I believe that he is very sincere.

129
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,119
He's recognized some things.

130
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:24,080
I mean, understanding as we consider the backdrop that we just reviewed in chapter number 20

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,359
if you were in the shoes of Abimelech and you see that God Almighty appears to you and

132
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:33,599
says these things to you and operate in this way, and this is what God says of Abraham,

133
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:37,320
he's a prophet and he's going to pray for you, and then he prays for you and you're

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,000
healed and you can reproduce, I mean, there's a certain understanding that you have with

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,119
regard to how God is working in the heart of this individual, amen?

136
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:56,000
And so Abraham is there and we find that Abimelech comes and says, this is my perception,

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,919
this is what I've observed, this is what I've seen in thee, that God is

138
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,659
with thee in all that thou doest."

139
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,679
I believe it was very obvious to Abimelech.

140
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,019
I believe that as Abimelech observed,

141
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,999
maybe even from a distance,

142
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,959
that he could see the blessing

143
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,159
and favor of God upon Abraham.

144
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,079
And though we would believe

145
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,199
that Abimelech was a powerful individual

146
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,879
and had great might,

147
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,639
we find that he was intimidated.

148
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,979
Remember, why was it in the first place

149
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,359
that Abraham said, she's my sister?

150
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,739
Because he was fearful, right?

151
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:34,179
He wasn't going to be fearful of somebody

152
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,819
that was weak and unable to fight or defend.

153
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,719
We find that he was fearful of this.

154
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,299
And so we find that this man Abimelech,

155
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,219
he and his host, no doubt they had power,

156
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,459
but they understood the power of God

157
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,699
because of what they'd experienced in chapter number 20.

158
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,939
And then they perceive,

159
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,399
they understand that God is with Abraham.

160
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,419
I mentioned it this morning,

161
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,099
but I wonder this evening,

162
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:02,279
how many people watch us and observe us

163
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,459
and have seen us and would conclude

164
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,619
that that's a child of God.

165
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,379
God is with them.

166
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,299
God is prospering them.

167
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:12,979
God is blessing them.

168
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,619
God is working through them.

169
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:17,019
God is using them.

170
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,579
See, I wonder even as we begin to think about

171
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,879
the time, the day and age in which we live

172
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,579
and thinking about some of the thoughts

173
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,579
from this morning and looking at this passage

174
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,059
of Scripture this evening,

175
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,099
the reality is that we're living in a time

176
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,819
in a society when, look, people are confused

177
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,419
and people are fearful and people are afraid

178
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:37,019
and people don't know where to go and what to do.

179
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,619
And it's a chaotic time that we're living in.

180
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:44,179
If they see that we as the people of God

181
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,979
are just as confused and just as fearful

182
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:50,859
and just as living in chaos as they are,

183
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,959
we don't really have a whole lot to offer.

184
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,779
But God says that he'd give us his peace.

185
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,259
It's a peace that passeth all understanding.

186
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,059
We got our eyes on Jesus and we're understanding

187
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,399
that things are not falling apart,

188
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,099
they're falling in place and we understand

189
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,779
that God has a plan and a purpose and he's using us.

190
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,059
And they see that, man, there's something,

191
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,599
why don't you behave the same way?

192
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,259
I don't know all that was going on.

193
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,719
I don't know all that Abraham did and how he behaved

194
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,939
and what it was that Abimelech had observed,

195
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,779
but for him to have this statement,

196
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,139
for him to make this declaration

197
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,139
that God is with thee in all that thou doest, wow.

198
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,859
To me, that's a high compliment.

199
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:39,539
To me, that's a wonderful perception of Abimelech

200
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,139
and again, I do not believe that it's a form of flattery.

201
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,659
I believe there was a level of sincerity.

202
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:50,379
And I believe that Abraham had lived his life in such a way

203
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:52,939
and as Abimelech had observed what had taken place

204
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,939
and what he'd experienced, he recognizes that God is,

205
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,359
God is working on his behalf

206
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,519
and I don't want anything to do with this guy.

207
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,359
So what does he do?

208
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:05,939
Well, as we continue through the passage of Scripture

209
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,819
in verses 23 through 32, number two,

210
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,299
if you're taking notes, the proposal from Abimelech.

211
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,639
What he does, he makes a proposal.

212
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,579
Notice what he says in verse 23.

213
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,259
Now therefore, because of what I've observed,

214
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,979
because of what I've perceived,

215
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,779
because of what I understood,

216
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,459
because God is with thee in all that thou doest,

217
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:30,379
now therefore, swear unto me here by God

218
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,499
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me,

219
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:37,379
nor with my son, nor with my son's son,

220
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,779
but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,

221
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,619
thou shalt do unto me into the land

222
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,379
wherein thou hast sojourned.

223
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,939
And we find that this proposal is made in verse number 23.

224
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,179
And though he had a measure of power

225
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,659
and capability from a military perspective,

226
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,819
I do not believe that this man desired

227
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,059
to really have any kind of engagement

228
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,099
in battle with Abraham because God was with him.

229
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:01,459
And not only for himself,

230
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:04,499
but he says for my son and for my son's son.

231
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,019
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture,

232
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,339
we begin to understand this proposal,

233
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,659
really what he's desiring,

234
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,659
he's seeking after a peace treaty.

235
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,859
There'll be some level of peace agreement.

236
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,299
Now, I believe that as this proposal is made,

237
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,779
the reality is that Abraham,

238
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,659
if he was going to walk with God

239
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,179
and he was to behave in the manner

240
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,139
in which he was to behave in,

241
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,459
that he would not deal falsely with Abimelech anyway.

242
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:34,299
Amen?

243
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,459
But that's not the common practice.

244
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,819
And so therefore, we understand why it is

245
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,819
that Abimelech would desire this peace treaty,

246
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,459
this covenant to be made.

247
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,299
But as the people of God,

248
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,219
we don't need somebody to come

249
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,179
and try to make some kind of a deal with us

250
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,699
that we're gonna deal properly with them,

251
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,019
that we will not deal falsely with them.

252
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,419
The reality is that as the people of God,

253
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,739
we're to live lives of integrity.

254
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,819
We're to live lives that are pleasing in the sight of God.

255
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,659
We find that I believe that Abraham

256
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,019
would have dealt properly in any case,

257
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:13,179
but this desire, this request,

258
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,259
this what he is seeking after

259
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,819
is on the part of Abimelech,

260
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,299
not on Abraham's part.

261
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:21,499
And Abraham says in verse 24,

262
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:22,979
I will swear.

263
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,939
It's interesting in the next few verses,

264
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:30,059
we see that there is a disputed well that is discussed

265
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,219
and Abraham takes a moment to reprove Abimelech

266
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,699
because of this well.

267
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,179
Notice in verse 25, it says,

268
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:37,819
and Abraham reproved Abimelech

269
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,939
because of a well of water.

270
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,299
The servants of Abimelech,

271
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,419
it says which Abimelech's servants

272
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,779
had violently taken away.

273
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,259
You understand that in this particular region

274
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,419
that wells were extremely important.

275
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,619
The process of digging a well

276
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:58,499
was a tiring, difficult process.

277
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,139
And we find that water is necessary.

278
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,259
The need for water, not only for yourself,

279
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,619
but you think about for your flocks and for your herds

280
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,659
and the necessity of water.

281
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,419
And so a well is a very important,

282
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,339
I mean, it's imperative to have wells of water.

283
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,419
We find that Abraham is reproving Abimelech

284
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,979
because of this well,

285
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:27,459
and he says that your servants had violently taken it away.

286
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:31,739
Abimelech said, I will not who hath done this thing,

287
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,019
neither didst thou tell me,

288
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,699
neither yet heard I of it, but today.

289
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,219
Abimelech says that he was not aware of this situation

290
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,059
according to what we read in verse 26.

291
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,219
And we find that Abraham had told him

292
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,179
what had taken place.

293
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,859
Now, I believe, remember this is the same Abraham

294
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,979
that back in Genesis chapter number 14,

295
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:54,899
he heard about what was taking place with his nephew Lot

296
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,739
and all that was taking place with the battle

297
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,179
and the group of kings,

298
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,539
that coalition that had set themselves

299
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,179
and had taken Lot captive.

300
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,899
And he takes his own trained servants from his own house

301
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:10,819
and he goes and he has victory in chapter number 14.

302
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,819
I believe, based on what I read in chapter number 14,

303
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,139
now these many years later,

304
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:18,939
as God has blessed and prospered Abraham,

305
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:21,579
that most likely he could have fought

306
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,539
against the servants of Abimelech

307
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:26,059
and retained possession of the well.

308
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,179
I can't prove that biblically,

309
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,379
but I do believe that it's certainly

310
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,779
within the realm of possibility.

311
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,819
For whatever reason, Abraham chose not to engage

312
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:40,739
in that particular response to what had taken place.

313
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:43,379
And we find that though these servants had come

314
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,059
and taken it, that now he's taking the opportunity

315
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,339
to reprove Abimelech for that which had happened.

316
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,139
And Abraham then, in verse 27,

317
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,979
took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech

318
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,379
and both of them made a covenant.

319
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,939
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

320
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,739
And Abimelech said unto Abraham,

321
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:04,299
what mean these seven ewe lambs

322
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,779
which thou hast set by themselves?

323
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:11,059
And he, Abraham said, for these seven ewe lambs

324
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,379
shalt thou take of my hand

325
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,419
and they may be a witness unto me

326
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,499
that I have digged this well.

327
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,219
This was customary in this particular time

328
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:26,379
in this culture that they would deal

329
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,899
with things in this manner.

330
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,379
And he says that I want it to be a witness

331
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,139
that I have digged this well.

332
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,419
And then he called the place Beersheba

333
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,859
because there they swear, both of them.

334
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:43,659
We see that this covenant now is ratified, if you will.

335
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,260
It's interesting, the word Beersheba,

336
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,459
it means a well of the seven.

337
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:51,899
In fact, it's still, of course, a place today

338
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,979
that you could go and visit and see that.

339
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,299
And the reminder, even of the name of the place,

340
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,059
all the way back in Genesis 21,

341
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,419
because of those seven ewe lambs that were set forward

342
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,219
as being this token, if you will,

343
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:10,139
this witness that Abraham had digged that well.

344
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,099
So we see that the covenant is ratified.

345
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,659
I just pause here for a moment

346
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,019
to think about what has just transpired.

347
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,700
And we see the perception of Abimelech

348
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,659
and we see that he recognizes that God is with thee

349
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,059
in all that thou doest.

350
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,459
And therefore, he makes this proposal of this peace treaty,

351
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,500
this covenant, if you will,

352
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,059
and the covenant is ratified.

353
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,139
And I wonder, as we would consider our own lives

354
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,739
and the different era, no doubt, in which we live,

355
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,779
but I wonder this evening,

356
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,579
how many people know that we can pray

357
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,299
and see God answer prayer?

358
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,859
You understand what I'm saying?

359
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:55,099
It almost seems as if there's a great mocking

360
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,299
that's going on in our era today, in our culture today,

361
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,539
toward the people of God.

362
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:08,339
There's a great mockery of those that would speak against the people of God as if we have

363
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,079
no God in heaven that can answer.

364
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,419
But we serve the Lord God omnipotent, and He rules and He reigns.

365
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:23,179
And listen, we don't serve false gods that can't hear and can't act and can't respond.

366
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,019
We're not the worshipers of Baal that you see in the situation with Elijah.

367
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:32,459
No, we serve the true God of heaven that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all

368
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,419
that we ask or think.

369
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,639
And I believe at times it may be that people don't see the power of our God because we

370
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:46,259
don't have faith to exercise in our God being able to do something.

371
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,379
You know what God says in Malachi?

372
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:54,819
I understand it's with regard to giving and how they had robbed God of the tithe, but

373
00:20:54,819 --> 00:21:00,659
He says, prove me, prove me and see if I won't do this.

374
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,939
You know, there are times in our lives that God says, prove me, prove me.

375
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,819
A couple of examples.

376
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:16,339
The one that I just mentioned with Elijah, praying and God sending fire from heaven.

377
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:22,019
How bold would you have been, how bold would I have been in the midst of that great company

378
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,259
to pray that prayer?

379
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,059
Believing that God could do it?

380
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,699
That God would do it?

381
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:35,579
I preached a message on Tuesday at the AIBF meeting to the pastors that were there.

382
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:41,859
And as I preached that message, I used a portion of Scripture and I spoke about Moses.

383
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:48,539
And when Moses was instructed in Exodus 17, they got to the place where there's no water.

384
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,219
And God says, here's what I want you to do after he prayed and God answers and He says,

385
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,819
I want you to go out this way and I'm going to go before you and I'm going to show you

386
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,899
the rock and I want you to strike the rock.

387
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:02,459
But He tells them this, to take the elders and do it in front of the people.

388
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,259
You know what I said to the men that were in that room on Tuesday, I said, you know,

389
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,579
if it were me and perhaps if it were you, we'd try to find out if that thing would happen

390
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,019
privately.

391
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,939
Do you understand what I'm saying?

392
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:19,339
But we serve a God that is able to do all things.

393
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:24,179
And there's a time in our lives where we need to come to a place where other people see

394
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,859
that our God is real, that our God hears and answers prayer.

395
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,419
That I'm not going to operate in fear and I'm not going to cave in to the pressures

396
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,899
of the world and I'm not going to fold to the deception and to the open-mindedness and

397
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:37,899
all the things.

398
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:38,899
No, no.

399
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,179
We got a God in heaven that is able.

400
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:42,179
Amen?

401
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:50,659
I want to tell you about the, some may know this particular account, but it's just a powerful

402
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,819
example of what we're looking at here this evening where this man Abimelech, he perceives

403
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,299
this truth, this reality about Abraham and therefore he says, listen, I don't want anything

404
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,659
to do with this guy.

405
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,619
I need to find out a way to have a peace treaty with this guy.

406
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,019
I need to have a covenant with this guy because God is with him.

407
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,659
But I don't want to mess with that, right?

408
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:19,619
The Queen of Mary, excuse me, the Queen Mary, the Queen of Mary, that's good, isn't it?

409
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:29,259
Queen Mary, she says this, she said this, that she feared the prayers of John Knox more

410
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:37,339
than she feared all of the armies of Scotland.

411
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,659
John Knox.

412
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:51,699
She feared his prayers, one man, more than all of the armies of Scotland.

413
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:52,699
That's powerful.

414
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,859
It's not about John Knox.

415
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:57,619
It's about his God.

416
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,899
It's about our God.

417
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:01,739
Amen?

418
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:08,099
And we look and we find what's going on and we say, listen, we serve a God that is capable,

419
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:13,259
that is worthy, and there are times in our lives, and I believe that now is the hour

420
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,979
that people need to see in us and through us that our God is real.

421
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:22,179
It's not just theory.

422
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,499
It's practice.

423
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:30,979
It's not just some level of theory that we have all of these right answers and can rehearse

424
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:36,219
all of these verses of Scripture and know that this is what, no, no, it's practice.

425
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,779
This is how God can work in my life today.

426
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:46,059
In my difficult situation, in my moment of, humanly speaking, impossible.

427
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,459
With God, all things are possible.

428
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:50,959
Do we believe that?

429
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,699
Do we live that way?

430
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,939
Do we prove God?

431
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:55,939
Right?

432
00:24:55,939 --> 00:25:04,259
Because, look, I understand there are times in which it's like, what happens if it doesn't

433
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,499
turn out right?

434
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,439
And we get intimidated.

435
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,219
But you know what that is?

436
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,379
That's doubt.

437
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,659
I preached a series several years ago.

438
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,459
Our theme for that particular year was increase our faith.

439
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:25,579
And as we had as our series for that particular year, it wasn't through a particular book.

440
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,419
It was more of a topical study.

441
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:35,299
And each week of that year, I purposed to preach a message that would deal with something

442
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,219
that would help increase our faith.

443
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:41,419
And how our faith can be increased.

444
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:45,699
We looked at a number of different portions of Scripture and we looked at how God built

445
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,339
the faith of His people and so on and so forth.

446
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:53,459
But one particular statement that I repeated often in that particular calendar year was

447
00:25:53,459 --> 00:26:00,379
that if faith is a flower, then doubt is a weed.

448
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,699
And weeds choke out flowers.

449
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:06,879
And so we must deal with the weed of doubt.

450
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,259
We must get rid of doubt.

451
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,579
How do we deal with doubt?

452
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,179
How do we deal with unbelief?

453
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,179
We need to get in the book.

454
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,819
We need to have our faith increased.

455
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:22,699
Why was it that as those spies went to spy out the land, as we read, as Moses had given

456
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:26,899
the instruction to go and to spy out the land, they came back, ten of them, with an

457
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,379
evil report of unbelief?

458
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,539
They didn't believe that God was able.

459
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,539
Why?

460
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,539
Because of what they saw.

461
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,299
But I want you to think about this just for a moment.

462
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,299
They saw some things as they went and spied out that land for forty days.

463
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,499
They saw that there were giants in the land.

464
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,499
They saw that they had fortified cities.

465
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:53,779
They observed those things and therefore they concluded we be not able.

466
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,299
But can you just for a moment rehearse in your mind all of the things that they had

467
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,779
seen God do?

468
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:10,039
When they were in Egypt and when they were there and they were under great turmoil.

469
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,019
And God sends Moses and there's a series of plagues.

470
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:19,819
You think about those ten plagues and you think about the power of God that was displayed.

471
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,479
They saw that.

472
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:26,419
Then you go forward and you begin to think about the crossing of the Red Sea.

473
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:29,059
What power was displayed by our God?

474
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,659
You think about after they crossed the Red Sea and you think about the water that God

475
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:33,659
provided.

476
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,199
You think about the manna that God provided.

477
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,179
You think about more water that God provided.

478
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:43,179
And you just begin to think about all that they saw God do.

479
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,259
Then they go in and they spot a land and they see some giants and they see some fortified

480
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:52,859
cities and all of a sudden they don't believe that God is able.

481
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:53,859
Doubt and unbelief.

482
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:59,059
In Psalm 78 the Bible says that they limited the Holy One of Israel.

483
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,819
You know how we limit the unlimited God?

484
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,139
Doubt.

485
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,219
Unbelief.

486
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,699
You say He's the unlimited God.

487
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:07,699
How could He be limited?

488
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,179
By our unbelief.

489
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,499
He did not many miracles there.

490
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:12,499
Why?

491
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:13,499
Because of their unbelief.

492
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:22,219
It's time that we believe God and that other people can see in us that God is real.

493
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:24,939
That God does answer prayer.

494
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:28,619
That God does work and God is still on His throne.

495
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,699
We see the perception.

496
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:30,899
We see the proposal.

497
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:35,179
I want you to notice as we finish up the chapter this evening here in Genesis 21.

498
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,339
I want you to notice the priority of Abraham.

499
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:39,539
The priority of Abraham.

500
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,339
The Bible says in verse 33,

501
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,619
And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba.

502
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,419
Now understand that this is pre-law.

503
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:53,259
Understand that this was a valid process, a place where he would worship, no doubt,

504
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:57,859
as the Bible says, and called there on the name of the Lord God, the everlasting God.

505
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:02,659
In the law it would be forbidden to have groves, but we find this again predates.

506
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,059
And Abraham planted a grove there.

507
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,099
He planted it with the purpose.

508
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,539
Obviously there's work involved.

509
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,659
Abraham is an old man at this point.

510
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:11,899
We understand that.

511
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,259
But there's work that's involved.

512
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,299
He plants this grove in Beersheba and he worships.

513
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:20,339
The Bible says that he called there on the name of the Lord.

514
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:26,139
Notice this, the everlasting God, El Olam.

515
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:32,019
It's interesting as we begin to remind ourselves this evening of the way in which God reveals

516
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:37,380
his character and his nature through his names.

517
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,500
We find that for Abraham, it was back in Genesis chapter 14, turn back there if you will.

518
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,179
I referenced this passage of Scripture moments ago with regard to the coalition that was

519
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,380
formed and took Lot captive and how Abraham took the trained servants from his house and

520
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
then had victory.

521
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,619
And we find that Melchizedek, the king of Salem in verse number 18, brought forth bread

522
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:00,619
and wine.

523
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:04,399
and he was the priest of the Most High God."

524
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,159
El Elyon, that's the first reference of this name of God

525
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,559
in all of the Scripture.

526
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,479
And we find that it was here that Abraham understands,

527
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,759
his name is still Abram,

528
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,879
but you find that he understands

529
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:20,939
that God is the Most High God.

530
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:23,239
It's interesting that Abraham then says this

531
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,279
in verse 22 of Genesis 14,

532
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,239
and Abram said to the king of Sodom,

533
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,079
"'I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

534
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,239
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.'"

535
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,559
Aren't you thankful that God revealed Himself

536
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,799
to Abraham as being the Most High God

537
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,679
before the king of Sodom was able to get to him

538
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,139
and offer what he offered?

539
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,539
No, no.

540
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,879
God had Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

541
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:58,039
to first meet Abraham and tell Abraham about El Elyon,

542
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,299
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

543
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,999
We find that it's in Genesis 17

544
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,159
that God reveals Himself to Abraham as El Shaddai.

545
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,899
Notice the Bible says in verse number one,

546
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:16,699
"'And when Abram was 90 years old and nine,

547
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,079
the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him,

548
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,079
"'I am the Almighty God.

549
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,259
"'Walk before Me and be thou perfect.'"

550
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,339
El Shaddai, the Almighty God,

551
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,439
the name that is mentioned here for the first time

552
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,619
in Genesis 17 in verse number one,

553
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,899
where God reveals Himself to Abraham

554
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:38,059
as being the Almighty God.

555
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,759
We find that it would be in chapter 18,

556
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,099
just a short period of time later,

557
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,719
that God asks Abraham in verse 14,

558
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,799
"'Is anything too hard for the Lord?'

559
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,419
I'm thankful that God asked Abraham that question

560
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,619
after He had first revealed Himself to Abraham

561
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,959
as being the Almighty God.'"

562
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,479
Amen?

563
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,519
Because God says,

564
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,679
"'Abraham, I am El Shaddai, I am the Lord God Almighty.'

565
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,339
And then He says a little while later,

566
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:11,399
"'Is anything too hard for Me?'

567
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,259
Well, you just told me that you're the Lord God Almighty.

568
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:18,679
The answer to the question must be no.

569
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,339
There's nothing too hard for you.

570
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,179
Why?

571
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,319
Because you're the Almighty God.

572
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,979
You're El Shaddai.'"

573
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,659
Here, in Genesis 21, in verse 33,

574
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:34,039
He uses the name El Olam, the everlasting God.

575
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,199
I want you to think about the significance of this.

576
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,959
It's interesting because there have been many references

577
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,379
to the idea of forever and eternal things

578
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,779
that are mentioned to Abraham,

579
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,860
but it's not here until the 21st chapter

580
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,399
that the name El Olam is first given to us

581
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,979
in understanding that He is the everlasting God.

582
00:32:56,979 --> 00:33:00,139
Again, turn back to chapter 13, if you will,

583
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:03,759
and I want you to notice what God says to Abraham

584
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,779
here in this portion of Scripture.

585
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:08,259
Again, I understand his name is still Abram at this point.

586
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:11,000
Forgive me if you want to be that technical,

587
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,759
talking about the same guy.

588
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,000
And so it says here,

589
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,759
I'll just get all messed up if I keep going back and forth.

590
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,759
In verse 15, it says,

591
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,539
"'For all the land which thou seest,

592
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,580
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,'

593
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,459
what does He say?

594
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:26,299
Forever.

595
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,539
Is there anything that you can do

596
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,699
that you can promise somebody forever?

597
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,919
I will always do this.

598
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:38,860
But you might not.

599
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,699
Forever.

600
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,659
God can say I'm going to give it to you forever

601
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,379
because He's the everlasting God.

602
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,839
He'd not yet revealed Himself with that name El Olam.

603
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,000
We find that comes here in chapter 21,

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,799
but notice the context of the promise

605
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,899
that He's going to give it to His seed forever.

606
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,319
Notice in chapter number 17,

607
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,159
a number of references that we'll look at quickly.

608
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,220
Notice in verse number seven,

609
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,299
it's oft repeated throughout this passage of Scripture.

610
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,399
The Bible says this in Genesis 17 in verse number seven,

611
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,220
"'And I will establish My covenant

612
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,839
between Me and thee and thy seed after thee

613
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,959
in their generations for an'," what?

614
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,279
Everlasting covenant.

615
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,199
To be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.

616
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,720
Notice in verse number eight,

617
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,119
"'And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee

618
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,399
the land wherein thou art a stranger,

619
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,500
all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession,

620
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,519
and I will be their God.'"

621
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,720
Notice verse 13.

622
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,720
He says, "'He that is born in thy house

623
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,600
and he that is bought with thy money

624
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,160
must needs be circumcised,

625
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,799
and My covenant shall be in your flesh

626
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,720
for an everlasting covenant.'"

627
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,239
Again in verse number 19,

628
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,040
"'And God said, Sarah, thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed

629
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,399
and thou shall call his name Isaac,

630
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,919
and I will establish My covenant with him

631
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:06,540
for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him,

632
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,160
though the name of God El Olam is not mentioned

633
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,519
until Genesis 21 and verse number 33.'"

634
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,559
No doubt we understand through the promises

635
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,380
that had been made through the statements

636
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,720
that God had given to Abraham

637
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,040
that there was an understanding

638
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,959
that He is the everlasting God.

639
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:30,959
I am thankful that we serve the everlasting God.

640
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,760
He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,

641
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,600
the first and the last.

642
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,699
Aren't you thankful for that?

643
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,959
I mean, when we think about the eternality

644
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:44,000
of God, it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly

645
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,959
that He has chosen to reveal Himself to us.

646
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,679
That He has given us the truth in His Word

647
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,679
with regard to His person, His character, His nature,

648
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,320
and we understand that He is indeed the everlasting God.

649
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,040
And the Bible says here in verse number 33

650
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,799
that Abraham called there on the name of the Lord

651
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,639
the everlasting God.

652
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,399
His reign is forever.

653
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,760
He'll never be conquered.

654
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
He'll never be defeated.

655
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,839
He's the everlasting God.

656
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
It says in verse number 34,

657
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,839
and Abraham sojourned in the Philistine's land many days.

658
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,320
It's interesting that we find that the Bible

659
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,279
would reveal to us in verse 33

660
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,720
about him planting this grove in Beersheba

661
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,559
and their calling on the name of the Lord.

662
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,600
I believe this was a priority for Abraham.

663
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,720
I believe that as you study the life of Abraham

664
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
as we started many, many, many months ago

665
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,199
back in Genesis chapter number 12

666
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,019
and you begin to see how Abraham,

667
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,479
just how he worshiped the Lord and how he set up altars.

668
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:56,000
And you begin to consider as we look here in Genesis 21

669
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,959
and he was gonna dwell in this place for many days

670
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:02,199
and understanding that this is where God had him

671
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,000
and he's calling on the name of the Lord.

672
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,199
I wonder this evening as we look at the context

673
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,160
of all that's given to us here

674
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,699
in this last section of Genesis 21,

675
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,660
I believe that it is this truth

676
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,600
that is given to us in verse number 33

677
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,859
that's a key to the observation that is made by Abimelech.

678
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,079
It's the key.

679
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,600
It's the priority of Abraham to worship God

680
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,839
that results in the favor of God

681
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,220
upon the life of Abraham.

682
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,559
That leads to Abimelech making the observation

683
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,720
and perceiving that God is with thee

684
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,579
in all that thou doest.

685
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,880
And the observation that is made

686
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,699
in the beginning of our text of scripture this evening

687
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,880
is the direct result, I believe, of the worship,

688
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,399
the priority of Abraham that we read of

689
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:02,699
at the end of the chapter.

690
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,820
We must make worship a priority.

691
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,019
We must make our time with God a priority.

692
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,119
There are many times that we face life,

693
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,239
listen, I understand we live in a busy time.

694
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,600
I understand.

695
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,619
We're pulled in different directions all of the time.

696
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,919
There's something that is always pulling for you

697
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,959
in your time and your attention.

698
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:32,960
But if we're not careful,

699
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,239
we can take care of some of these emergencies

700
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,000
and miss out on the most important thing that we could do,

701
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,359
spending time with God.

702
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,559
There are certain things in our lives that we prioritize.

703
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,500
There are people that prioritize things.

704
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,619
No doubt you have certain responsibilities

705
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,080
that you have in your life

706
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,900
and you have a list of priorities

707
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,659
and you have maybe this week a list of things

708
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:07,640
that you have to tend to and take care of.

709
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,839
And perhaps you'll go through an exercise

710
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,419
of prioritizing those things

711
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:14,339
and you'll list the most pressing,

712
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,500
most important thing at the top of that list

713
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,900
that requires your attention to take care of that.

714
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,700
Can I tell you that we must prioritize our time with God?

715
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,239
And we must guard our time with God.

716
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,659
As we think about Abraham here

717
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,900
in calling on the name of the Lord

718
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,380
and prioritizing his worship of God,

719
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,659
I believe that in our lives today

720
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:43,099
that it's not sufficient enough for us

721
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:46,599
to just kind of haphazardly try to have a time with God.

722
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:52,219
If we don't purpose to spend time with God,

723
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:53,659
it's just not gonna happen.

724
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,440
There are way too many things to do

725
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,880
and way too many things that are pulling for your attention

726
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,200
that it's just going to.

727
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,240
by chance, happen that you're going to spend time with God.

728
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,960
You've got a purpose to do it.

729
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,360
You have to prioritize to do it.

730
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,040
And there may be things that you have to cut out.

731
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,840
There may be things that you say, you know what?

732
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,740
I'm not going to be able to tend to that today

733
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,040
because I need to have my time with God today.

734
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,960
There are things in which people have prioritized

735
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,860
in their lives and there are things in which people,

736
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,840
depending on what their, maybe their profession

737
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,280
or what their desires, their dreams and aspirations are,

738
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
that they will prioritize certain things

739
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,360
and they will allow nothing to interfere with that thing

740
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,960
because they've set a particular goal.

741
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,760
And I just wonder, as the people of God,

742
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
do we have that same perspective

743
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,920
with regard to our priority of our time with God?

744
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,080
Listen, something better be burning down

745
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,480
to interrupt my time with God.

746
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,400
Seriously, it has to be a priority.

747
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,200
It has to be a priority.

748
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,660
Because as we spend time with God,

749
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,480
as we have that walk with God,

750
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,620
that's when somebody's going to say, God is with thee.

751
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,280
I see that it's real.

752
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,760
Why?

753
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,120
Because it is real.

754
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,880
Because I have spent time with God.

755
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,320
Do you ever wonder about the disciples

756
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,120
in Acts chapter number four?

757
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,640
There's a great miracle that takes place

758
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,080
in Acts chapter number three.

759
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,240
Peter and John are going into the temple

760
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,760
and the man that's lame is laying there

761
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
and he's asking for money.

762
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,800
He's asking for alms.

763
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,000
And Peter looks at him and says, look over here,

764
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,620
and I think the man had every expectation

765
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,280
that he was going to get some type of monetary gift.

766
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,120
And then those words come out of Peter's mouth,

767
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,200
silver and gold have I none.

768
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,320
What disappointment that man might have had in that moment.

769
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,080
Why?

770
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,440
Because that's what he was looking for.

771
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,600
But such as I have, give I thee

772
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,460
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

773
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,240
rise up and walk.

774
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,480
He got a whole lot more than he was looking for.

775
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,920
Amen?

776
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,320
And the Bible tells us that he gets up,

777
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,600
man, he's leaping and praising God.

778
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,760
He goes into the temple.

779
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,680
It's amazing what happens.

780
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,520
You come to Acts chapter number four.

781
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,440
And there's a big stir and a big controversy.

782
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,880
Because the religious leaders of the day,

783
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,680
the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin,

784
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,400
they don't like what's taking place.

785
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,320
They don't like all these people getting saved

786
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,900
and all these things happening.

787
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,180
And they're not profiting the way they'd like to profit.

788
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,760
And they call these men into question.

789
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,680
Peter stands and he says, if we be questioned

790
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,720
on this day of the miracle that took place.

791
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,800
And he goes through and he says, look,

792
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,240
it's not in our power, it's not in my name.

793
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,960
It's in the name of Jesus.

794
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,640
And he says this, and there's no other name

795
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,240
under heaven given among men whereby ye must be saved.

796
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,520
The boldness.

797
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,200
They didn't like it.

798
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,340
If you read the very next verse,

799
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,960
I believe it's Acts 4.13,

800
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,240
it says that they perceived that they were ignorant

801
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,480
and unlearned men.

802
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,200
But that they had been with Jesus.

803
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,400
Is that what it says?

804
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,760
I closed my Bible, that's what it says, right?

805
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,480
They perceived they were ignorant and unlearned men,

806
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,480
but they had been with Jesus.

807
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,680
Does anyone know that we've been with Jesus?

808
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,360
Seriously.

809
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,200
You look at Abraham and Abimelech says,

810
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,200
God is with thee in all that thou doest.

811
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,960
Therefore, I need to make a covenant with you.

812
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,520
I need to have a peace treaty.

813
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,420
And we see at the end of the passage,

814
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,880
the priority of Abraham that is the key

815
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,620
to the observation that is made

816
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,600
in the beginning of our text this evening.

817
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,060
Why is it that Abimelech perceived?

818
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,200
Why is it that he observed that God is with thee

819
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,960
in all that thou doest?

820
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,720
Because Abraham made a priority to worship God.

821
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,080
And when we make a priority to worship God,

822
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,320
when we spend time with Jesus,

823
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,080
when we take and we protect that time,

824
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,460
when we say nothing's gonna interrupt this time,

825
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm going to spend time with God,

826
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,320
it's gonna make a difference.

827
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,600
And people will perceive you've been with Jesus.

828
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,240
And God works, and God does amazing things.

829
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,340
Because we've spent time with him, we've worshiped him.

830
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:55,480
What a great observation of Abimelech.

831
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,120
But it didn't happen by some kind of random chance.

832
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,920
There's a priority of Abraham.

833
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,760
Let's pray.

834
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,360
Father, we love you.

835
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,559
We thank you for loving us.

836
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,600
I pray God that you would help us

837
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,000
to prioritize our time with thee.

838
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,320
God, we recognize tonight that we live

839
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,200
in the hustle and bustle era.

840
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,320
So many things that are vying for our attention, our time.

841
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,120
God, we need you.

842
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,200
We need that time with you.

843
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,820
We need to enter into your presence.

844
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,200
We need that quiet time with you.

845
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,559
To just be still and know that you are God.

846
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,760
To worship you as you deserve.

847
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,800
That you might teach us your word and your way.

848
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,120
That while others observe us and see us,

849
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,520
that it would not be about us, it'd be all about you.

850
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,880
They would see that we've been with Jesus.

851
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,400
We'd say, as John the Baptist said,

852
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,480
he must increase, I must decrease.

853
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,400
Would you help us, Lord,

854
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,920
to exalt and magnify you in our lives?

855
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,240
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

856
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,640
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

857
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,920
Would you stand with me?
