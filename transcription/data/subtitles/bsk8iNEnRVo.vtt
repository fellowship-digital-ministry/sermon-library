00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.739
I'll be finishing up this chapter this evening, verses 22 through 34.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:10.079
And this is our 55th lesson through the book of Genesis.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.739
And we have been just kind of slowly making our way through this book.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:20.659
Of course, the first 11 chapters, we spent many, many weeks, months, in fact, looking

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.899
at those foundational truths.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.340
And I often said, as we were studying those 11 chapters, how that the enemy seeks to attack

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:36.459
that portion of Scripture and the creation account and all that's contained within the

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.779
first several chapters of the book of Genesis.

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:44.979
Because if they can attack and cause doubt with regard to the foundation, then the rest

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.779
can kind of crumble.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.500
And I am thankful that God's Word has been given to us.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
And God's Word is sure, and it stands, it's profitable.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060
And I'm thankful for what God teaches us.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.560
As we study this 21st chapter, we find that it begins with that miraculous birth of Isaac.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.080
Remember, the Lord had made many promises to Abraham with regard to a seed, a son.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.120
And we find that it begins in verse number one, and it says, the Lord visited Sarah,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.400
notice, as he said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.739
God always does what he says he will do.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:28.779
And we find that though there was a period of waiting and though this oft-repeated promise

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:34.660
that was made to Abraham seemed as if it was far off, we find that it was fulfilled in

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.279
the beginning of this chapter, chapter 21 of the book of Genesis.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:45.160
We find that after this miraculous birth, we find that the child grew and was weaned

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and Abraham made a great feast.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:56.099
Throughout that process, we noticed how that, of course, Hagar and Ishmael were cast out.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.160
And these things, according to what Paul says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.639
God in the book of Galatians, these things are an allegory.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:08.520
The truth that was taught to us, that the Spirit and the flesh, they're at enmity one

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.360
with the other, and you had to cast out Hagar and Ishmael.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.740
And just like as believers, we must put off the old man.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.020
We must put off and crucify the flesh.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.520
We find now that as we enter into this final section of the book of this chapter, the book

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.300
of Genesis, chapter 21, we find here that there is an interaction that is recorded between

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.160
Abimelech, Phicol, the chief captain of his host, and Abraham.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.740
It's really an interesting dialogue that takes place, an interesting event that is

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.960
given to us, and I believe that as we end the chapter, you'll find it's interesting

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.279
to note how that Abraham is worshiping the Lord.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.639
As we begin looking at this passage of Scripture, we find in verse 22, the Bible says,

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.679
"...and it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the chief captain of

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.039
his host, spake unto Abraham, saying..."

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:13.559
Notice this phrase, "...God is with thee in all that thou doest."

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.919
I mentioned this morning as we were dealing with the subject matter of our behavior in

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.919
the workplace, how there was such a connection between that passage of Scripture and what

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.399
our behavior is to look like, and what we find here with this description, this observation,

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:36.880
if you will, that is given of Abraham from Abimelech, "...God is with thee in all that

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880
thou doest."

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.960
I've taken that phrase from verse 22 to use as our title this evening.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.119
And if you're taking notes, I want you to see first the perception of Abimelech.

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.279
The perception of Abimelech.

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.720
I want to remind you of the interaction back in Genesis chapter number 20.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.600
If you go back to chapter number 20, we find that the Bible tells us about Abraham taking

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
a journey.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.639
This is the second time in which this same type of situation occurs.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.240
The first time was back in previous chapter, and we looked and studied that and understood

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.440
what was going on.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.960
But here as we come to the 20th chapter of the book of Genesis, we find that this is

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.380
the first encounter between Abraham and Abimelech.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.119
There are some Bible scholars that doubt that this is the same Abimelech in chapter 21 as

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:22.000
we find in chapter number 20.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.320
I tend to believe that it's the same Abimelech.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.600
I believe that there's credibility with regard to the account, but there's also indication

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.320
as to why it is that Abimelech would desire to do and to have this covenant with Abraham

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.679
that we'll read of in just a moment based on what we see in chapter number 20.

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:47.799
But it's here in chapter number 20, you'll remember that Abraham operated in fear.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:51.640
Abraham went into this place, he was going to sojourn, and he goes in.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.079
And remember, he says that Sarah is my sister.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:02.559
And this is a recurring situation for Abraham, and we find that Abraham in this particular

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:07.760
situation, he'd done it back in chapter number 12 when he goes into Egypt with Pharaoh.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.279
And now in chapter number 20, he does it again.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.600
And we find that he was operating under fear, but yet God displayed his power.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.640
I'm thankful that our God is omnipotent.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.959
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:24.679
And we find here that God says, notice in chapter 20 in verse number 3, but God came

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:32.160
to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, behold, thou art but a dead man.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.279
For the woman which thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.559
Now can you imagine that kind of a greeting?

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:47.279
Abimelech was operating under what was supposedly social norms for him to be able to take this

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.279
Sarah.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.640
Again, it's a different environment than what we live in, but with understanding the times

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.239
and what was going on, Abraham says, she's my sister, and Abimelech says, man, I'm going

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:03.480
to take her, and God says, you're but a dead man.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.640
What a greeting, what an interaction.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.200
But Abimelech in verse number 4 had not come near her, and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.799
also a righteous nation?

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:19.040
He said, he nodded unto me, she is my sister, and she, even she herself said, he is my brother.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.119
In the integrity of my heart and in the innocency of my hands have I done this, and God said

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:28.239
unto him in a dream, yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart,

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:33.880
for I also withheld thee from sinning against me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880
her.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.920
Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.320
and thou shalt live.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.559
And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.600
thine.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.679
Wow.

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:55.079
We studied this in great detail when we looked at this passage of Scripture, but just by

00:06:55.079 --> 00:07:01.399
way of remembering and understanding the backdrop to what we're reading now in chapter 21, and

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:05.519
you think about this Abimelech, and you think about how God demonstrated His power and how

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.440
God shows up to him in a dream at night and tells him that he's but a dead man, and then

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.079
says I understand these are the things that you've done, but I want you to know that you're

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.040
to restore the man his wife.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.359
And notice what God says in verse number 7, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:23.279
thee, and thou shalt live.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:28.200
And then He tells him if you choose not to obey, you're going to die.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.920
He says that if thou restore her not, know thou, know thou, that thou shalt surely die,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.119
thou and all that are thine.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.119
You know what Abimelech does?

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:39.119
He believes God.

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:40.679
He really does.

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:45.160
It says then Abimelech rose early in the morning.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.000
You wonder why he rose early in the morning?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.559
Because he believed what God said.

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:51.720
Amen?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.000
And he rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.600
in their ears, and the men were sore afraid.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:08.480
We find that Abimelech took and restored Sarah, and we find that as he obeyed the Lord

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.440
and he restored Sarah, the Bible tells us that Abraham prayed for him.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.119
God said that would happen in verse number 7.

00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:21.040
He says that he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.200
Notice with me in verse number 17, the Bible says, so Abraham prayed unto God, and God

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.000
healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, and they bared children, for the Lord had

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.799
fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.559
Now we leave that account in chapter number 20, and we begin to read in chapter number

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:49.479
21 of the birth of Isaac and the growth of Isaac, the weaning of Isaac, the casting out

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:54.119
of Hagar and Ishmael, and then the Bible comes back in verse 22 and says, and it came to

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:58.840
pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicole, the chief captain of his host, spake unto

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.760
Abraham saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.320
As we think about this observation, the perception of Abimelech, I do not believe that this is

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.760
just Abimelech acting in some level of flattery.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.679
I believe that he is very sincere.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:19.119
He's recognized some things.

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:24.080
I mean, understanding as we consider the backdrop that we just reviewed in chapter number 20

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.359
if you were in the shoes of Abimelech and you see that God Almighty appears to you and

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:33.599
says these things to you and operate in this way, and this is what God says of Abraham,

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:37.320
he's a prophet and he's going to pray for you, and then he prays for you and you're

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:43.000
healed and you can reproduce, I mean, there's a certain understanding that you have with

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.119
regard to how God is working in the heart of this individual, amen?

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:56.000
And so Abraham is there and we find that Abimelech comes and says, this is my perception,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.919
this is what I've observed, this is what I've seen in thee, that God is

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.659
with thee in all that thou doest."

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:07.679
I believe it was very obvious to Abimelech.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:10.019
I believe that as Abimelech observed,

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:11.999
maybe even from a distance,

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:13.959
that he could see the blessing

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:17.159
and favor of God upon Abraham.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.079
And though we would believe

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:22.199
that Abimelech was a powerful individual

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:23.879
and had great might,

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:25.639
we find that he was intimidated.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.979
Remember, why was it in the first place

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:30.359
that Abraham said, she's my sister?

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:32.739
Because he was fearful, right?

00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:34.179
He wasn't going to be fearful of somebody

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:37.819
that was weak and unable to fight or defend.

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:39.719
We find that he was fearful of this.

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.299
And so we find that this man Abimelech,

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:45.219
he and his host, no doubt they had power,

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:47.459
but they understood the power of God

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:50.699
because of what they'd experienced in chapter number 20.

00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:51.939
And then they perceive,

00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:56.399
they understand that God is with Abraham.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.419
I mentioned it this morning,

00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:00.099
but I wonder this evening,

00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:02.279
how many people watch us and observe us

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:04.459
and have seen us and would conclude

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.619
that that's a child of God.

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:09.379
God is with them.

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:11.299
God is prospering them.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:12.979
God is blessing them.

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:14.619
God is working through them.

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:17.019
God is using them.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.579
See, I wonder even as we begin to think about

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.879
the time, the day and age in which we live

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:23.579
and thinking about some of the thoughts

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:25.579
from this morning and looking at this passage

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:27.059
of Scripture this evening,

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.099
the reality is that we're living in a time

00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:31.819
in a society when, look, people are confused

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:34.419
and people are fearful and people are afraid

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:37.019
and people don't know where to go and what to do.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:39.619
And it's a chaotic time that we're living in.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:44.179
If they see that we as the people of God

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.979
are just as confused and just as fearful

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:50.859
and just as living in chaos as they are,

00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:52.959
we don't really have a whole lot to offer.

00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:56.779
But God says that he'd give us his peace.

00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:59.259
It's a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.059
We got our eyes on Jesus and we're understanding

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:03.399
that things are not falling apart,

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:05.099
they're falling in place and we understand

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.779
that God has a plan and a purpose and he's using us.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:10.059
And they see that, man, there's something,

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:12.599
why don't you behave the same way?

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.259
I don't know all that was going on.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:17.719
I don't know all that Abraham did and how he behaved

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:19.939
and what it was that Abimelech had observed,

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:22.779
but for him to have this statement,

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:25.139
for him to make this declaration

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:30.139
that God is with thee in all that thou doest, wow.

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:33.859
To me, that's a high compliment.

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:39.539
To me, that's a wonderful perception of Abimelech

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:44.139
and again, I do not believe that it's a form of flattery.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.659
I believe there was a level of sincerity.

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:50.379
And I believe that Abraham had lived his life in such a way

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:52.939
and as Abimelech had observed what had taken place

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:56.939
and what he'd experienced, he recognizes that God is,

00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:58.359
God is working on his behalf

00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:01.519
and I don't want anything to do with this guy.

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.359
So what does he do?

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:05.939
Well, as we continue through the passage of Scripture

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:07.819
in verses 23 through 32, number two,

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:11.299
if you're taking notes, the proposal from Abimelech.

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:13.639
What he does, he makes a proposal.

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.579
Notice what he says in verse 23.

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:18.259
Now therefore, because of what I've observed,

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:19.979
because of what I've perceived,

00:13:19.979 --> 00:13:21.779
because of what I understood,

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:25.459
because God is with thee in all that thou doest,

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:30.379
now therefore, swear unto me here by God

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:33.499
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me,

00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:37.379
nor with my son, nor with my son's son,

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:39.779
but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.619
thou shalt do unto me into the land

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:43.379
wherein thou hast sojourned.

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:46.939
And we find that this proposal is made in verse number 23.

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:49.179
And though he had a measure of power

00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:52.659
and capability from a military perspective,

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:54.819
I do not believe that this man desired

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:57.059
to really have any kind of engagement

00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:00.099
in battle with Abraham because God was with him.

00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:01.459
And not only for himself,

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:04.499
but he says for my son and for my son's son.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.019
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:11.339
we begin to understand this proposal,

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:12.659
really what he's desiring,

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.659
he's seeking after a peace treaty.

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:17.859
There'll be some level of peace agreement.

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:21.299
Now, I believe that as this proposal is made,

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.779
the reality is that Abraham,

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:25.659
if he was going to walk with God

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:27.179
and he was to behave in the manner

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:29.139
in which he was to behave in,

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:32.459
that he would not deal falsely with Abimelech anyway.

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:34.299
Amen?

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:37.459
But that's not the common practice.

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.819
And so therefore, we understand why it is

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:42.819
that Abimelech would desire this peace treaty,

00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:44.459
this covenant to be made.

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.299
But as the people of God,

00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:48.219
we don't need somebody to come

00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:50.179
and try to make some kind of a deal with us

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:52.699
that we're gonna deal properly with them,

00:14:52.699 --> 00:14:55.019
that we will not deal falsely with them.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:58.419
The reality is that as the people of God,

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:00.739
we're to live lives of integrity.

00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:03.819
We're to live lives that are pleasing in the sight of God.

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.659
We find that I believe that Abraham

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:09.019
would have dealt properly in any case,

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:13.179
but this desire, this request,

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.259
this what he is seeking after

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:17.819
is on the part of Abimelech,

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:19.299
not on Abraham's part.

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:21.499
And Abraham says in verse 24,

00:15:21.499 --> 00:15:22.979
I will swear.

00:15:25.099 --> 00:15:26.939
It's interesting in the next few verses,

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:30.059
we see that there is a disputed well that is discussed

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.219
and Abraham takes a moment to reprove Abimelech

00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:34.699
because of this well.

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:36.179
Notice in verse 25, it says,

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:37.819
and Abraham reproved Abimelech

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:40.939
because of a well of water.

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.299
The servants of Abimelech,

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:44.419
it says which Abimelech's servants

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:46.779
had violently taken away.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.259
You understand that in this particular region

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:52.419
that wells were extremely important.

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:54.619
The process of digging a well

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:58.499
was a tiring, difficult process.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:01.139
And we find that water is necessary.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:04.259
The need for water, not only for yourself,

00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:07.619
but you think about for your flocks and for your herds

00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:09.659
and the necessity of water.

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:12.419
And so a well is a very important,

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:16.339
I mean, it's imperative to have wells of water.

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:21.419
We find that Abraham is reproving Abimelech

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:22.979
because of this well,

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:27.459
and he says that your servants had violently taken it away.

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:31.739
Abimelech said, I will not who hath done this thing,

00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:33.019
neither didst thou tell me,

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:36.699
neither yet heard I of it, but today.

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:39.219
Abimelech says that he was not aware of this situation

00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:41.059
according to what we read in verse 26.

00:16:41.059 --> 00:16:43.219
And we find that Abraham had told him

00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:44.179
what had taken place.

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:46.859
Now, I believe, remember this is the same Abraham

00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:49.979
that back in Genesis chapter number 14,

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:54.899
he heard about what was taking place with his nephew Lot

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:57.739
and all that was taking place with the battle

00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:00.179
and the group of kings,

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:02.539
that coalition that had set themselves

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:04.179
and had taken Lot captive.

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:06.899
And he takes his own trained servants from his own house

00:17:06.899 --> 00:17:10.819
and he goes and he has victory in chapter number 14.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.819
I believe, based on what I read in chapter number 14,

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.139
now these many years later,

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:18.939
as God has blessed and prospered Abraham,

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:21.579
that most likely he could have fought

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.539
against the servants of Abimelech

00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:26.059
and retained possession of the well.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:28.179
I can't prove that biblically,

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:30.379
but I do believe that it's certainly

00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:32.779
within the realm of possibility.

00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:36.819
For whatever reason, Abraham chose not to engage

00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:40.739
in that particular response to what had taken place.

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:43.379
And we find that though these servants had come

00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:46.059
and taken it, that now he's taking the opportunity

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:49.339
to reprove Abimelech for that which had happened.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:51.139
And Abraham then, in verse 27,

00:17:51.139 --> 00:17:53.979
took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:56.379
and both of them made a covenant.

00:17:56.379 --> 00:17:59.939
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:01.739
And Abimelech said unto Abraham,

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:04.299
what mean these seven ewe lambs

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:07.779
which thou hast set by themselves?

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:11.059
And he, Abraham said, for these seven ewe lambs

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.379
shalt thou take of my hand

00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:16.419
and they may be a witness unto me

00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:20.499
that I have digged this well.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:23.219
This was customary in this particular time

00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:26.379
in this culture that they would deal

00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:27.899
with things in this manner.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.379
And he says that I want it to be a witness

00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:34.139
that I have digged this well.

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:36.419
And then he called the place Beersheba

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:39.859
because there they swear, both of them.

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:43.659
We see that this covenant now is ratified, if you will.

00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:46.260
It's interesting, the word Beersheba,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.459
it means a well of the seven.

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:51.899
In fact, it's still, of course, a place today

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:53.979
that you could go and visit and see that.

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:57.299
And the reminder, even of the name of the place,

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.059
all the way back in Genesis 21,

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:02.419
because of those seven ewe lambs that were set forward

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:05.219
as being this token, if you will,

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:10.139
this witness that Abraham had digged that well.

00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:12.099
So we see that the covenant is ratified.

00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:13.659
I just pause here for a moment

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:16.019
to think about what has just transpired.

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:19.700
And we see the perception of Abimelech

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.659
and we see that he recognizes that God is with thee

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:25.059
in all that thou doest.

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:28.459
And therefore, he makes this proposal of this peace treaty,

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:30.500
this covenant, if you will,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.059
and the covenant is ratified.

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:36.139
And I wonder, as we would consider our own lives

00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:38.739
and the different era, no doubt, in which we live,

00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:40.779
but I wonder this evening,

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:45.579
how many people know that we can pray

00:19:45.579 --> 00:19:47.299
and see God answer prayer?

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.859
You understand what I'm saying?

00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:55.099
It almost seems as if there's a great mocking

00:19:55.099 --> 00:19:58.299
that's going on in our era today, in our culture today,

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.539
toward the people of God.

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:08.339
There's a great mockery of those that would speak against the people of God as if we have

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:12.079
no God in heaven that can answer.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:16.419
But we serve the Lord God omnipotent, and He rules and He reigns.

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:23.179
And listen, we don't serve false gods that can't hear and can't act and can't respond.

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:27.019
We're not the worshipers of Baal that you see in the situation with Elijah.

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:32.459
No, we serve the true God of heaven that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:34.419
that we ask or think.

00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:39.639
And I believe at times it may be that people don't see the power of our God because we

00:20:39.639 --> 00:20:46.259
don't have faith to exercise in our God being able to do something.

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:49.379
You know what God says in Malachi?

00:20:49.379 --> 00:20:54.819
I understand it's with regard to giving and how they had robbed God of the tithe, but

00:20:54.819 --> 00:21:00.659
He says, prove me, prove me and see if I won't do this.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:06.939
You know, there are times in our lives that God says, prove me, prove me.

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:09.819
A couple of examples.

00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:16.339
The one that I just mentioned with Elijah, praying and God sending fire from heaven.

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:22.019
How bold would you have been, how bold would I have been in the midst of that great company

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:27.259
to pray that prayer?

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:29.059
Believing that God could do it?

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:31.699
That God would do it?

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:35.579
I preached a message on Tuesday at the AIBF meeting to the pastors that were there.

00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:41.859
And as I preached that message, I used a portion of Scripture and I spoke about Moses.

00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:48.539
And when Moses was instructed in Exodus 17, they got to the place where there's no water.

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:52.219
And God says, here's what I want you to do after he prayed and God answers and He says,

00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:55.819
I want you to go out this way and I'm going to go before you and I'm going to show you

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:57.899
the rock and I want you to strike the rock.

00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:02.459
But He tells them this, to take the elders and do it in front of the people.

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:05.259
You know what I said to the men that were in that room on Tuesday, I said, you know,

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:09.579
if it were me and perhaps if it were you, we'd try to find out if that thing would happen

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.019
privately.

00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:14.939
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:19.339
But we serve a God that is able to do all things.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:24.179
And there's a time in our lives where we need to come to a place where other people see

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:28.859
that our God is real, that our God hears and answers prayer.

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:32.419
That I'm not going to operate in fear and I'm not going to cave in to the pressures

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:36.899
of the world and I'm not going to fold to the deception and to the open-mindedness and

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:37.899
all the things.

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:38.899
No, no.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.179
We got a God in heaven that is able.

00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:42.179
Amen?

00:22:42.499 --> 00:22:50.659
I want to tell you about the, some may know this particular account, but it's just a powerful

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:56.819
example of what we're looking at here this evening where this man Abimelech, he perceives

00:22:56.819 --> 00:23:01.299
this truth, this reality about Abraham and therefore he says, listen, I don't want anything

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:02.659
to do with this guy.

00:23:02.659 --> 00:23:05.619
I need to find out a way to have a peace treaty with this guy.

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:10.019
I need to have a covenant with this guy because God is with him.

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:13.659
But I don't want to mess with that, right?

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:19.619
The Queen of Mary, excuse me, the Queen Mary, the Queen of Mary, that's good, isn't it?

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:29.259
Queen Mary, she says this, she said this, that she feared the prayers of John Knox more

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:37.339
than she feared all of the armies of Scotland.

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:39.659
John Knox.

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:51.699
She feared his prayers, one man, more than all of the armies of Scotland.

00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:52.699
That's powerful.

00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:55.859
It's not about John Knox.

00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:57.619
It's about his God.

00:23:57.619 --> 00:23:59.899
It's about our God.

00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:01.739
Amen?

00:24:01.739 --> 00:24:08.099
And we look and we find what's going on and we say, listen, we serve a God that is capable,

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:13.259
that is worthy, and there are times in our lives, and I believe that now is the hour

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:18.979
that people need to see in us and through us that our God is real.

00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:22.179
It's not just theory.

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:24.499
It's practice.

00:24:24.499 --> 00:24:30.979
It's not just some level of theory that we have all of these right answers and can rehearse

00:24:30.979 --> 00:24:36.219
all of these verses of Scripture and know that this is what, no, no, it's practice.

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.779
This is how God can work in my life today.

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:46.059
In my difficult situation, in my moment of, humanly speaking, impossible.

00:24:46.059 --> 00:24:49.459
With God, all things are possible.

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:50.959
Do we believe that?

00:24:50.959 --> 00:24:52.699
Do we live that way?

00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:54.939
Do we prove God?

00:24:54.939 --> 00:24:55.939
Right?

00:24:55.939 --> 00:25:04.259
Because, look, I understand there are times in which it's like, what happens if it doesn't

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:06.499
turn out right?

00:25:06.499 --> 00:25:08.439
And we get intimidated.

00:25:08.439 --> 00:25:10.219
But you know what that is?

00:25:10.219 --> 00:25:12.379
That's doubt.

00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:14.659
I preached a series several years ago.

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:20.459
Our theme for that particular year was increase our faith.

00:25:20.459 --> 00:25:25.579
And as we had as our series for that particular year, it wasn't through a particular book.

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:28.419
It was more of a topical study.

00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:35.299
And each week of that year, I purposed to preach a message that would deal with something

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:38.219
that would help increase our faith.

00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:41.419
And how our faith can be increased.

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:45.699
We looked at a number of different portions of Scripture and we looked at how God built

00:25:45.699 --> 00:25:48.339
the faith of His people and so on and so forth.

00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:53.459
But one particular statement that I repeated often in that particular calendar year was

00:25:53.459 --> 00:26:00.379
that if faith is a flower, then doubt is a weed.

00:26:00.379 --> 00:26:03.699
And weeds choke out flowers.

00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:06.879
And so we must deal with the weed of doubt.

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:09.259
We must get rid of doubt.

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:10.579
How do we deal with doubt?

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:12.179
How do we deal with unbelief?

00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:13.179
We need to get in the book.

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:15.819
We need to have our faith increased.

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:22.699
Why was it that as those spies went to spy out the land, as we read, as Moses had given

00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:26.899
the instruction to go and to spy out the land, they came back, ten of them, with an

00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:29.379
evil report of unbelief?

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:33.539
They didn't believe that God was able.

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:34.539
Why?

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:35.539
Because of what they saw.

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:39.299
But I want you to think about this just for a moment.

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:43.299
They saw some things as they went and spied out that land for forty days.

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:45.499
They saw that there were giants in the land.

00:26:45.499 --> 00:26:48.499
They saw that they had fortified cities.

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:53.779
They observed those things and therefore they concluded we be not able.

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:58.299
But can you just for a moment rehearse in your mind all of the things that they had

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:01.779
seen God do?

00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:10.039
When they were in Egypt and when they were there and they were under great turmoil.

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:14.019
And God sends Moses and there's a series of plagues.

00:27:14.019 --> 00:27:19.819
You think about those ten plagues and you think about the power of God that was displayed.

00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:22.479
They saw that.

00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:26.419
Then you go forward and you begin to think about the crossing of the Red Sea.

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:29.059
What power was displayed by our God?

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:32.659
You think about after they crossed the Red Sea and you think about the water that God

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:33.659
provided.

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:35.199
You think about the manna that God provided.

00:27:35.199 --> 00:27:37.179
You think about more water that God provided.

00:27:37.179 --> 00:27:43.179
And you just begin to think about all that they saw God do.

00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:47.259
Then they go in and they spot a land and they see some giants and they see some fortified

00:27:47.259 --> 00:27:52.859
cities and all of a sudden they don't believe that God is able.

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:53.859
Doubt and unbelief.

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:59.059
In Psalm 78 the Bible says that they limited the Holy One of Israel.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:01.819
You know how we limit the unlimited God?

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:03.139
Doubt.

00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:05.219
Unbelief.

00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:06.699
You say He's the unlimited God.

00:28:06.699 --> 00:28:07.699
How could He be limited?

00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:09.179
By our unbelief.

00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:11.499
He did not many miracles there.

00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:12.499
Why?

00:28:12.499 --> 00:28:13.499
Because of their unbelief.

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:22.219
It's time that we believe God and that other people can see in us that God is real.

00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:24.939
That God does answer prayer.

00:28:24.939 --> 00:28:28.619
That God does work and God is still on His throne.

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:29.699
We see the perception.

00:28:29.699 --> 00:28:30.899
We see the proposal.

00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:35.179
I want you to notice as we finish up the chapter this evening here in Genesis 21.

00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:38.339
I want you to notice the priority of Abraham.

00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:39.539
The priority of Abraham.

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:41.339
The Bible says in verse 33,

00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:44.619
And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba.

00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:47.419
Now understand that this is pre-law.

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:53.259
Understand that this was a valid process, a place where he would worship, no doubt,

00:28:53.259 --> 00:28:57.859
as the Bible says, and called there on the name of the Lord God, the everlasting God.

00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:02.659
In the law it would be forbidden to have groves, but we find this again predates.

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:05.059
And Abraham planted a grove there.

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:07.099
He planted it with the purpose.

00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:08.539
Obviously there's work involved.

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.659
Abraham is an old man at this point.

00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:11.899
We understand that.

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:13.259
But there's work that's involved.

00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:16.299
He plants this grove in Beersheba and he worships.

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:20.339
The Bible says that he called there on the name of the Lord.

00:29:20.339 --> 00:29:26.139
Notice this, the everlasting God, El Olam.

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:32.019
It's interesting as we begin to remind ourselves this evening of the way in which God reveals

00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:37.380
his character and his nature through his names.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.500
We find that for Abraham, it was back in Genesis chapter 14, turn back there if you will.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:48.179
I referenced this passage of Scripture moments ago with regard to the coalition that was

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:53.380
formed and took Lot captive and how Abraham took the trained servants from his house and

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.380
then had victory.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:59.619
And we find that Melchizedek, the king of Salem in verse number 18, brought forth bread

00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:00.619
and wine.

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:04.399
and he was the priest of the Most High God."

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:08.159
El Elyon, that's the first reference of this name of God

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.559
in all of the Scripture.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:14.479
And we find that it was here that Abraham understands,

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.759
his name is still Abram,

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:17.879
but you find that he understands

00:30:17.879 --> 00:30:20.939
that God is the Most High God.

00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:23.239
It's interesting that Abraham then says this

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:25.279
in verse 22 of Genesis 14,

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.239
and Abram said to the king of Sodom,

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:31.079
"'I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:35.239
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.'"

00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:40.559
Aren't you thankful that God revealed Himself

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.799
to Abraham as being the Most High God

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.679
before the king of Sodom was able to get to him

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:49.139
and offer what he offered?

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:50.539
No, no.

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:53.879
God had Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:58.039
to first meet Abraham and tell Abraham about El Elyon,

00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:04.299
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:06.999
We find that it's in Genesis 17

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:11.159
that God reveals Himself to Abraham as El Shaddai.

00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:13.899
Notice the Bible says in verse number one,

00:31:13.899 --> 00:31:16.699
"'And when Abram was 90 years old and nine,

00:31:16.699 --> 00:31:19.079
the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him,

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.079
"'I am the Almighty God.

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:25.259
"'Walk before Me and be thou perfect.'"

00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:29.339
El Shaddai, the Almighty God,

00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:31.439
the name that is mentioned here for the first time

00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:33.619
in Genesis 17 in verse number one,

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:35.899
where God reveals Himself to Abraham

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:38.059
as being the Almighty God.

00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:40.759
We find that it would be in chapter 18,

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:43.099
just a short period of time later,

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:45.719
that God asks Abraham in verse 14,

00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:48.799
"'Is anything too hard for the Lord?'

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:53.419
I'm thankful that God asked Abraham that question

00:31:53.419 --> 00:31:56.619
after He had first revealed Himself to Abraham

00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.959
as being the Almighty God.'"

00:32:00.219 --> 00:32:01.479
Amen?

00:32:01.479 --> 00:32:02.519
Because God says,

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:06.679
"'Abraham, I am El Shaddai, I am the Lord God Almighty.'

00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:09.339
And then He says a little while later,

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:11.399
"'Is anything too hard for Me?'

00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:15.259
Well, you just told me that you're the Lord God Almighty.

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:18.679
The answer to the question must be no.

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.339
There's nothing too hard for you.

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:21.179
Why?

00:32:21.179 --> 00:32:22.319
Because you're the Almighty God.

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.979
You're El Shaddai.'"

00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:27.659
Here, in Genesis 21, in verse 33,

00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:34.039
He uses the name El Olam, the everlasting God.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.199
I want you to think about the significance of this.

00:32:38.199 --> 00:32:40.959
It's interesting because there have been many references

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:44.379
to the idea of forever and eternal things

00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:47.779
that are mentioned to Abraham,

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.860
but it's not here until the 21st chapter

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.399
that the name El Olam is first given to us

00:32:53.399 --> 00:32:56.979
in understanding that He is the everlasting God.

00:32:56.979 --> 00:33:00.139
Again, turn back to chapter 13, if you will,

00:33:00.139 --> 00:33:03.759
and I want you to notice what God says to Abraham

00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:05.779
here in this portion of Scripture.

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:08.259
Again, I understand his name is still Abram at this point.

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:11.000
Forgive me if you want to be that technical,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.759
talking about the same guy.

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:14.000
And so it says here,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.759
I'll just get all messed up if I keep going back and forth.

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:17.759
In verse 15, it says,

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:20.539
"'For all the land which thou seest,

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:23.580
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,'

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.459
what does He say?

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:26.299
Forever.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.539
Is there anything that you can do

00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:32.699
that you can promise somebody forever?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.919
I will always do this.

00:33:36.979 --> 00:33:38.860
But you might not.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.699
Forever.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.659
God can say I'm going to give it to you forever

00:33:44.679 --> 00:33:46.379
because He's the everlasting God.

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:52.839
He'd not yet revealed Himself with that name El Olam.

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:55.000
We find that comes here in chapter 21,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.799
but notice the context of the promise

00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:59.899
that He's going to give it to His seed forever.

00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:02.319
Notice in chapter number 17,

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:05.159
a number of references that we'll look at quickly.

00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:07.220
Notice in verse number seven,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.299
it's oft repeated throughout this passage of Scripture.

00:34:10.299 --> 00:34:13.399
The Bible says this in Genesis 17 in verse number seven,

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:15.220
"'And I will establish My covenant

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.839
between Me and thee and thy seed after thee

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:20.959
in their generations for an'," what?

00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:23.279
Everlasting covenant.

00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:26.199
To be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.720
Notice in verse number eight,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.119
"'And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:32.399
the land wherein thou art a stranger,

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:36.500
all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.519
and I will be their God.'"

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:40.720
Notice verse 13.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.720
He says, "'He that is born in thy house

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.600
and he that is bought with thy money

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.160
must needs be circumcised,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.799
and My covenant shall be in your flesh

00:34:48.799 --> 00:34:51.720
for an everlasting covenant.'"

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.239
Again in verse number 19,

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:57.040
"'And God said, Sarah, thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.399
and thou shall call his name Isaac,

00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:01.919
and I will establish My covenant with him

00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:06.540
for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.160
though the name of God El Olam is not mentioned

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.519
until Genesis 21 and verse number 33.'"

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:16.559
No doubt we understand through the promises

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:19.380
that had been made through the statements

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.720
that God had given to Abraham

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.040
that there was an understanding

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.959
that He is the everlasting God.

00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.959
I am thankful that we serve the everlasting God.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.760
He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.600
the first and the last.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.699
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:39.959
I mean, when we think about the eternality

00:35:39.959 --> 00:35:44.000
of God, it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.959
that He has chosen to reveal Himself to us.

00:35:47.959 --> 00:35:50.679
That He has given us the truth in His Word

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:53.679
with regard to His person, His character, His nature,

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:57.320
and we understand that He is indeed the everlasting God.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.040
And the Bible says here in verse number 33

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.799
that Abraham called there on the name of the Lord

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:06.639
the everlasting God.

00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:10.399
His reign is forever.

00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:11.760
He'll never be conquered.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.440
He'll never be defeated.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.839
He's the everlasting God.

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:17.839
It says in verse number 34,

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:22.839
and Abraham sojourned in the Philistine's land many days.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.320
It's interesting that we find that the Bible

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.279
would reveal to us in verse 33

00:36:30.279 --> 00:36:33.720
about him planting this grove in Beersheba

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.559
and their calling on the name of the Lord.

00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:38.600
I believe this was a priority for Abraham.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.720
I believe that as you study the life of Abraham

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.720
as we started many, many, many months ago

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.199
back in Genesis chapter number 12

00:36:45.199 --> 00:36:48.019
and you begin to see how Abraham,

00:36:48.019 --> 00:36:52.479
just how he worshiped the Lord and how he set up altars.

00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:56.000
And you begin to consider as we look here in Genesis 21

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.959
and he was gonna dwell in this place for many days

00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:02.199
and understanding that this is where God had him

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:05.000
and he's calling on the name of the Lord.

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:10.199
I wonder this evening as we look at the context

00:37:10.199 --> 00:37:12.160
of all that's given to us here

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.699
in this last section of Genesis 21,

00:37:15.699 --> 00:37:17.660
I believe that it is this truth

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.600
that is given to us in verse number 33

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.859
that's a key to the observation that is made by Abimelech.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.079
It's the key.

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:30.600
It's the priority of Abraham to worship God

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.839
that results in the favor of God

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:35.220
upon the life of Abraham.

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:42.559
That leads to Abimelech making the observation

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.720
and perceiving that God is with thee

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.579
in all that thou doest.

00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:51.880
And the observation that is made

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.699
in the beginning of our text of scripture this evening

00:37:54.699 --> 00:37:57.880
is the direct result, I believe, of the worship,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.399
the priority of Abraham that we read of

00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:02.699
at the end of the chapter.

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:06.820
We must make worship a priority.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.019
We must make our time with God a priority.

00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:14.119
There are many times that we face life,

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:17.239
listen, I understand we live in a busy time.

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.600
I understand.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.619
We're pulled in different directions all of the time.

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.919
There's something that is always pulling for you

00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:27.959
in your time and your attention.

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:32.960
But if we're not careful,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.239
we can take care of some of these emergencies

00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:44.000
and miss out on the most important thing that we could do,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.359
spending time with God.

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:51.559
There are certain things in our lives that we prioritize.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:54.500
There are people that prioritize things.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.619
No doubt you have certain responsibilities

00:38:58.239 --> 00:38:59.080
that you have in your life

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.900
and you have a list of priorities

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.659
and you have maybe this week a list of things

00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:07.640
that you have to tend to and take care of.

00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:10.839
And perhaps you'll go through an exercise

00:39:10.839 --> 00:39:12.419
of prioritizing those things

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:14.339
and you'll list the most pressing,

00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:16.500
most important thing at the top of that list

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.900
that requires your attention to take care of that.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.700
Can I tell you that we must prioritize our time with God?

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.239
And we must guard our time with God.

00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:30.659
As we think about Abraham here

00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.900
in calling on the name of the Lord

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.380
and prioritizing his worship of God,

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.659
I believe that in our lives today

00:39:39.659 --> 00:39:43.099
that it's not sufficient enough for us

00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:46.599
to just kind of haphazardly try to have a time with God.

00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:52.219
If we don't purpose to spend time with God,

00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:53.659
it's just not gonna happen.

00:39:55.039 --> 00:39:57.440
There are way too many things to do

00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:59.880
and way too many things that are pulling for your attention

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.200
that it's just going to.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.240
by chance, happen that you're going to spend time with God.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.960
You've got a purpose to do it.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.360
You have to prioritize to do it.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.040
And there may be things that you have to cut out.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.840
There may be things that you say, you know what?

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.740
I'm not going to be able to tend to that today

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.040
because I need to have my time with God today.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.960
There are things in which people have prioritized

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.860
in their lives and there are things in which people,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.840
depending on what their, maybe their profession

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.280
or what their desires, their dreams and aspirations are,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.080
that they will prioritize certain things

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.360
and they will allow nothing to interfere with that thing

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.960
because they've set a particular goal.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.760
And I just wonder, as the people of God,

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.080
do we have that same perspective

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.920
with regard to our priority of our time with God?

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.080
Listen, something better be burning down

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.480
to interrupt my time with God.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.400
Seriously, it has to be a priority.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.200
It has to be a priority.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.660
Because as we spend time with God,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.480
as we have that walk with God,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.620
that's when somebody's going to say, God is with thee.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.280
I see that it's real.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.760
Why?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.120
Because it is real.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.880
Because I have spent time with God.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.320
Do you ever wonder about the disciples

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.120
in Acts chapter number four?

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.640
There's a great miracle that takes place

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.080
in Acts chapter number three.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.240
Peter and John are going into the temple

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.760
and the man that's lame is laying there

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.080
and he's asking for money.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.800
He's asking for alms.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.000
And Peter looks at him and says, look over here,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.620
and I think the man had every expectation

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.280
that he was going to get some type of monetary gift.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.120
And then those words come out of Peter's mouth,

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.200
silver and gold have I none.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.320
What disappointment that man might have had in that moment.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.080
Why?

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.440
Because that's what he was looking for.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.600
But such as I have, give I thee

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.460
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.240
rise up and walk.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.480
He got a whole lot more than he was looking for.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.920
Amen?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.320
And the Bible tells us that he gets up,

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.600
man, he's leaping and praising God.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.760
He goes into the temple.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.680
It's amazing what happens.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.520
You come to Acts chapter number four.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.440
And there's a big stir and a big controversy.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.880
Because the religious leaders of the day,

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.680
the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin,

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.400
they don't like what's taking place.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.320
They don't like all these people getting saved

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.900
and all these things happening.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.180
And they're not profiting the way they'd like to profit.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.760
And they call these men into question.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.680
Peter stands and he says, if we be questioned

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.720
on this day of the miracle that took place.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.800
And he goes through and he says, look,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.240
it's not in our power, it's not in my name.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.960
It's in the name of Jesus.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.640
And he says this, and there's no other name

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.240
under heaven given among men whereby ye must be saved.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.520
The boldness.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.200
They didn't like it.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.340
If you read the very next verse,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.960
I believe it's Acts 4.13,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.240
it says that they perceived that they were ignorant

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.480
and unlearned men.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.200
But that they had been with Jesus.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.400
Is that what it says?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.760
I closed my Bible, that's what it says, right?

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.480
They perceived they were ignorant and unlearned men,

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.480
but they had been with Jesus.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.680
Does anyone know that we've been with Jesus?

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.360
Seriously.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.200
You look at Abraham and Abimelech says,

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.200
God is with thee in all that thou doest.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.960
Therefore, I need to make a covenant with you.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.520
I need to have a peace treaty.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.420
And we see at the end of the passage,

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.880
the priority of Abraham that is the key

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.620
to the observation that is made

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.600
in the beginning of our text this evening.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.060
Why is it that Abimelech perceived?

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.200
Why is it that he observed that God is with thee

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.960
in all that thou doest?

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.720
Because Abraham made a priority to worship God.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.080
And when we make a priority to worship God,

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.320
when we spend time with Jesus,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.080
when we take and we protect that time,

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.460
when we say nothing's gonna interrupt this time,

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.160
I'm going to spend time with God,

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.320
it's gonna make a difference.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.600
And people will perceive you've been with Jesus.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.240
And God works, and God does amazing things.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.340
Because we've spent time with him, we've worshiped him.

00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:55.480
What a great observation of Abimelech.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.120
But it didn't happen by some kind of random chance.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.920
There's a priority of Abraham.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.760
Let's pray.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.360
Father, we love you.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.559
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:08.600
I pray God that you would help us

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.000
to prioritize our time with thee.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.320
God, we recognize tonight that we live

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.200
in the hustle and bustle era.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.320
So many things that are vying for our attention, our time.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.120
God, we need you.

00:45:29.279 --> 00:45:31.200
We need that time with you.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.820
We need to enter into your presence.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.200
We need that quiet time with you.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.559
To just be still and know that you are God.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.760
To worship you as you deserve.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.800
That you might teach us your word and your way.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.120
That while others observe us and see us,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.520
that it would not be about us, it'd be all about you.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.880
They would see that we've been with Jesus.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.400
We'd say, as John the Baptist said,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.480
he must increase, I must decrease.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.400
Would you help us, Lord,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.920
to exalt and magnify you in our lives?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.240
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.640
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.920
Would you stand with me?
