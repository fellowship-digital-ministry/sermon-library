00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
Chapter number nine, and I think Juliana this morning

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.440
has a little bit of mixed emotions.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.360
Today marks nine year, excuse me,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.600
11 years of ministry here for us

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.960
at Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.619
and it's also her last Sunday at Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.399
Of course, we trust that she'll be back

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.239
and visit over the years,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.879
but she's getting married next week,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.959
and so on Saturday, actually this week,

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.340
and it's amazing to see what God has done in 11 years.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.719
We're so thankful for the privilege

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.000
of being able to serve in this capacity,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.639
but she was thinking about that this week

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.560
of how it's the anniversary Sunday

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.279
and also her last Sunday,

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.880
and we trust that God will use her

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.799
as she moves down North Carolina and serves the Lord there.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:40.939
Matthew chapter number nine,

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:43.360
looking at verses nine through 13 this morning,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.040
Matthew chapter number nine,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.000
beginning in verse number nine,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.880
the Bible says, and as Jesus passed forth from thence,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.840
he saw a man named Matthew,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.400
sitting at the receipt of custom,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.919
and he saith unto him, follow me.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.759
And he rose and followed him.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.559
It came to pass, as Jesus sat at me in the house,

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:07.879
behold, many publicans and sinners came

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.680
and sat down with him and his disciples,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.959
and when the Pharisees saw it,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.000
they said unto his disciples,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.720
why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.839
By the way, I'm thankful that Jesus loves sinners, amen?

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.639
And it says in verse number 12,

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.760
but when Jesus heard that,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.819
notice the disciples didn't even have chance

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.980
to respond, Jesus heard the question and he responded.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.379
It says that he said unto them,

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:38.059
they that behold need not a physician,

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:40.019
but they that are sick.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.339
The sickness, of course, is that of sin.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:45.419
It's a universal condition of all mankind,

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.099
apart from the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.220
He is the perfect sinless one,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.059
but of course, every other human being,

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:55.819
sinful by nature in need of the Savior.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.339
Verse 13, but go ye and learn what that meaneth.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.220
I will have mercy and not sacrifice,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.839
for I am not come to call the righteous,

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.319
but sinners to repentance.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.220
Notice the phrase at the end of verse number nine,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.020
and he arose and followed him.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.740
I'm gonna preach a message this morning

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.740
that I've simply entitled from that thought,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.300
he arose and followed him.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.419
Matthew chapter nine begins,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.020
the first eight verses is Matthew's record

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.020
of the healing of the man that was born of four.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.740
And we're familiar with the passage of scripture.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.660
In fact, in Sunday school for a number of months now,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.940
we've been studying the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.460
And it was many months ago

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.419
that we studied this particular miracle.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.500
And it's really one of my top five, probably.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.779
I love the passages of scripture that deal with it

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.699
and the cooperation of the men,

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.539
the determination of the men

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.619
to bring this man to the Savior.

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.259
They knew that he was sick of the palsy.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.399
He needed to see Jesus.

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.220
But we find that when Jesus was teaching the house,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.500
there were so many people and they couldn't get there.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.899
And they were determined and they went up on the rooftop

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.339
and they let the man down and God healed him.

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.740
And what a blessing.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.539
Not only did the Lord Jesus Christ heal the man,

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.860
but he said, thy sins are forgiven.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.419
Now that caused a great stir

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.020
amongst the religious leaders that were there.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.500
Many of those that were there,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.139
were there for the purpose of finding fault with Jesus.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.580
And we find that they heard that statement

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.940
and they were grieved in their heart, they were bothered.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.660
And here's what they said, only God can forgive sins.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.419
Amen, absolutely.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.300
That is absolutely correct.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.860
And it was through the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.899
saying to that man, thy sins are forgiven,

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:43.899
that he was proving and showing evidence that he is God.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.699
We find that he says to those religious leaders,

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.100
those skeptics, he says, so that you would know

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.559
that I have power to forgive sins.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.899
I say unto thee, take up thy bed

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.699
and walk, rise and walk.

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.500
And man, what a great miracle.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.139
And you think about the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.059
We find that in Matthew chapter number eight,

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.460
it's amazing as you go through the eighth chapter of Matthew

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.740
and you find just miracle after miracle after miracle

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.299
and just the power of Christ on display.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.820
And then we come to our text of scripture this morning.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.339
And as we come to the text of scripture this morning,

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:24.619
we find that God gives us the record,

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:28.859
the details, if you will, of the call of Matthew.

00:04:28.859 --> 00:04:31.059
And we find that the text of scripture

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.059
starts out really in a simple way.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.059
It says, as Jesus passed forth from thence.

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:42.140
As Jesus passed forth from thence,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.339
we've said it multiple times in the last couple of weeks

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:45.779
in our Sunday school class,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.260
that Jesus always moves with purpose.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.779
We find in our lives, we can rejoice

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.980
in knowing as we study the scriptures

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.940
and we see the purpose of the Lord in his word

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.420
that even in my life today and in your life today,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.859
God is moving with purpose.

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:04.980
He does nothing by mistake.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.820
He does nothing to just do it for the sake of doing it.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.779
He has purpose and he has plan.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.820
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.459
that as you read this passage

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:18.660
and then you begin to see Matthew,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.100
I really think for Matthew, perhaps this day started

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.299
like any other day would start.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:27.899
The Bible tells us that he was sitting

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:29.779
at the receipt of custom.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.179
I mean, he did this probably regularly.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:34.459
You think about your routine,

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.459
you think about your daily routine and what you do,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.059
and we could say it this way, he went to work, right?

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:42.260
He was a tax collector.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.059
By the way, he's hated because of being a tax collector.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.339
And on top of being a tax collector, he was a Jew.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.619
And that really was a problem

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.459
because they were really working for the Romans

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:55.260
and it was just a big problem, a big mess.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.540
But this was his routine.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.619
He's going to work as a tax collector.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:00.420
He's sitting at the receipt of custom

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.100
and he's just really any typical day.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.420
But this day that started out in typical fashion,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.980
maybe a day that we would say that started

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
as an ordinary day comes with an unexpected visit

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.779
and it ends with an extraordinary meeting.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.500
And I love the passage of scripture here in Matthew 9

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.500
as we think about the call of God

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.140
upon this man, Matthew, in his response.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.420
This morning, I believe that as we study the word of God

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.339
that we've all been called to follow him

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.660
and we'll deal with that in the message this morning.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.019
But I also believe that God is placing a special call

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.220
on the lives of individuals to follow him

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.579
in a similar type of capacity, not the same office.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.420
We know that the office of apostle is no longer an office,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.859
but God is still calling people.

00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:54.700
The Bible tells us that Jesus,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.420
as you think about the prayer request

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.540
of the Lord Jesus Christ at the end of this chapter,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.339
he says to his disciples,

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.980
if you look there in 9 in verse number 37,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.339
the harvest truly is plenteous,

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:12.100
but the laborers are few.

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.739
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:20.540
that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.019
I believe that God's still calling laborers.

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:24.980
I believe that God's still sending forth laborers.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.859
I believe that this morning

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:29.100
that we ought to be praying that God,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.380
we ought to be praying just as he instructed us here

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.260
that he would send forth laborers into his harvest

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.540
because the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.820
I got an article this week that was sent to me

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.700
and it said that 42% of those that are in full-time ministry

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.100
are considering resigning today.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.980
That is just frightening to me.

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:55.260
That is a huge number.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.220
Now, they didn't call me.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.540
I'm not part of the statistic, amen,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.220
but I don't know how that is across the board,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.820
but I just think about the call and we look at Matthew

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.059
and let's dig in.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:10.100
I would say this, if you're taking notes this morning,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.739
the simplicity of the call.

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.459
Notice the simplicity of the call.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.179
Jesus passed by.

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:18.779
Matthew was simply fulfilling his duty.

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.820
It says that Jesus passed forth from thence

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.700
in verse number nine.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.220
He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.820
and he saith unto him, follow me.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.020
Isn't that simple?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.020
I mean, the simplicity of the call is there

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.020
and we find that Jesus simply said, follow me.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.140
We think about the other accounts

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.299
in which God gives us in his word of calling the disciples

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.659
and calling the apostles.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.219
I think about Andrew when he's there and Peter

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:48.020
and you see what's taking place.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.539
Of course, Peter was a fisherman

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.219
and you think about Peter

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:53.960
and the circumstances surrounding his call

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.099
and Jesus says, follow me.

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:59.539
And then he says this, I will make you fishers of men.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.340
And you think about the importance of the call

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.780
that Jesus placed and the simplicity of the call

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.799
and we find that here it's a simple, follow me.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.140
Following the Lord Jesus Christ is critical.

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:19.739
We, of course, understand we've played the game

00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:21.820
with children of follow the leader.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.380
We've played a game of Simon says and what have you

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.900
and we've tried to teach them the importance of following.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.260
You ever try to follow someone on the highway?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.979
In these parts of the country, it can be challenging, right?

00:09:34.979 --> 00:09:37.659
There's so much traffic, so many things going on

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.979
and we had a little caravan, if you will,

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.820
on Thursday as we traveled up to Sight and Sound

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.700
and I was kind of leading and I made the comment to Holly.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.460
I said, this is terrible

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.640
because you got two cars behind you

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.179
and you got all this traffic

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:53.140
and you're trying to make sure

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.500
that they're able to see you and follow

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.000
but it's almost worse for the guy in the back

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.500
because he's trying to follow.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.619
follow.

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:07.900
But we think about the simplicity of the call here, again, an ordinary day for Matthew.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.659
I believe that he probably got up that morning and went through his normal routine, and he

00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:16.380
just did the normal things that he would do, and he goes, and he's sitting at the receipt

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.500
of custom, and Jesus comes by.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.340
And as he's sitting there just fulfilling his duty, doing that which he did on a number

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:37.619
of other days, Jesus says, follow me, follow me, wow, the simplicity of the call.

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:43.779
But when I think about the simplicity of the call, it must not overshadow the seriousness

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:44.779
of the call.

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:48.459
And if you're taking notes quickly after the simplicity of the call, I want you to see

00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:50.700
the seriousness of the call.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.900
As I think about the call of Jesus and the life of Matthew, and I think about the instruction

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.340
for us as the people of God to follow the Lord Jesus Christ, I would say that this call

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.860
is life-changing.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.580
We see it being life-changing in the life of Matthew, we'll look at some of this here

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.220
in just a few moments, but I want you to think about who Jesus is.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.900
We've already made note of the fact that Matthew 9 begins with the healing of the man that

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.819
was sick of the palsy, and Jesus tells him, thy sins are forgiven, proving that he is

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.379
God.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.500
And I want you to understand this morning that as you think about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:30.779
and His earthly ministry, and you think about the seriousness of the call that God Almighty,

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:34.900
God in flesh, is saying to Matthew, follow me.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.180
Man, that's a serious call.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:47.180
To think that God Almighty would call any of us to follow Him.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.220
I was corresponding with one of our missionaries over text yesterday, and they were rejoicing

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:58.279
in some opportunities that God has given them in recent days, and I had had correspondence

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:03.279
in recent days with them, and was praying with them about a couple of these meetings

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:08.260
and opportunities, and man, we're just rejoicing in what God has done and how God has answered

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.259
prayer.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:13.899
And I sent a note, and I said, man, to God be the glory, I'm just rejoicing with you,

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:20.660
and they replied, and then my response was this, to think that God would use any of us.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.919
What a privilege to be used of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:29.740
You think about Matthew, again I've already made note that he's the tax collector.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.779
He is not the popular guy in town.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:37.979
These tax collectors, they were given authority from the Roman government, and they were given

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:42.779
responsibility to levy taxes, and the way in which they made their money was by levying

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:47.899
a higher tax than what they had to give the Romans, and they would just exploit people.

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:48.899
They were hated.

00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:57.300
And he's sitting there at the receipt of custom, and Jesus says, follow me.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.559
It's a simple call, but it's a serious call.

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:02.860
It's not something that should be taken lightly.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.820
As a child of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a child of God, we ought to take seriously the

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.500
call that God has placed in each of our lives to follow Him, to follow Him.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:20.279
See, as we think about the truth this morning of the seriousness of the call, I would say,

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:28.300
in a general sense, every single child of God has been called to follow Jesus.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.399
In fact, we find that as you study the book of Acts, that they were first called Christians

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:38.539
and Antioch, and it was because of their behavior, because of what they did and how they followed

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:39.539
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:45.339
And as I think about the call for every child of God to follow Jesus, I'm mindful of what

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:47.139
Jesus said in Mark chapter 8.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.539
Turn over, if you will, and hold your place in Matthew.

00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:54.940
We'll be back there, but turn over to Mark chapter number 8, if you will.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:01.660
Mark chapter number 8, Jesus is speaking here, and what great truth He provides us with regard

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.539
to following Him.

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:07.619
And again, in a general sense, every child of God has been called to follow the Lord

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:09.460
Jesus Christ.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.380
We find that He begins in Mark 8, verse number 34, when He had called the people unto Him,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.100
with His disciples also, He said unto them.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.660
Now understand, He's called the disciples, apostles, if you will, and we find the specific

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.480
call that He gives to the apostles, and we'll mention that in more detail in just a moment,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.459
but He's speaking to the people.

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:38.940
He called the people unto Him, and then He says this, whosoever will come after me, let

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:45.739
him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

00:14:45.739 --> 00:14:49.339
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:52.459
my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:58.100
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.339
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:04.459
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful

00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:09.540
generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.700
of His Father with the holy angels.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.619
But I want you to focus on verse number 34 when Jesus says, whosoever will come after

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:24.779
me, notice what He says, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:30.660
I believe, and we'll look at it as we end the message this morning, but there's great

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:36.140
insight given to us with regard to the importance of surrender when it comes to following the

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.359
Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:38.359 --> 00:15:43.820
If I don't first deny myself and take up my cross, it's going to be really challenging

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.119
to follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:51.420
And that's why He set forth the pattern that He set forth here in verse number 34, that

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.859
if you're going to come after me, if you're going to be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:56.859 --> 00:16:01.980
you understand that you first must deny yourself.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.500
I believe it was Dio Mudi that made the statement that the biggest opposer that he had in his

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.779
life was the man that he shaved daily.

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:14.019
Self gets in the way a whole lot, doesn't it?

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:15.700
I mean, honestly.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:22.220
Many times we could say it this way, we're our own worst enemy, right?

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.420
And here we find that He says, deny himself.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.940
Here's how Paul said it, I am crucified with Christ.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.899
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:36.859
In the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:39.239
loved me and gave Himself for me.

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:45.140
And we think about the truth of denying ourselves, understanding that we're going to have that

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.660
position of self-denial.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.660
Why?

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.859
Because we want to follow Jesus.

00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:53.739
I then take up the cross and take up His cross and follow me.

00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:55.540
Follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:03.179
Peter said it this way in 1 Peter 2, and he, of course, is writing to a group of people

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:09.059
that have been under intense persecution, Nero is ruling, and they've been scattered

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:11.660
abroad and all of these things that are taking place.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:18.540
And Peter says to these individuals that are suffering and facing great difficulty, he

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:28.339
tells them in 1 Peter 2, in verse number 21, for even hereunto were ye called.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:39.940
Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow His steps.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.019
In a very general sense, every child of God, if you've been born again, if you're here

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:50.739
this morning and you've trusted Christ as your Savior, the will of God is that we follow

00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:51.739
Christ.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:52.739
That we follow Him.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:58.220
You know, sometimes as we follow Christ, He's going to lead us directly into a storm.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220
You say, no.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.220
Hell yeah.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:07.059
He's going to lead us into a situation that we might look at as being a mess.

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:12.799
But God wants to use you in that messy situation to bring glory to Himself, right?

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:18.679
As we follow Him, we find that we're following His leadership, and He will guide us and direct

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:22.839
us and He will use us for His honor and for His glory.

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.279
What a great song this morning.

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:26.760
God sees the storm from the other side.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.200
Aren't you thankful for that this morning?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.919
And you think about the disciples when Jesus said, let us get under the boat and pass to

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:33.919
the other side.

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:36.760
He knew there was going to be a storm.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.260
He was developing His servants.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.520
He was developing His disciples.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.359
And this morning, we find that as we understand the seriousness of the call, that each of

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:55.400
us would have this impact on us that would really have a sobering effect, that Jesus

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.520
has called me to be a follower of Christ, to follow Him.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.760
Now, as you go back to Matthew chapter number 9, we find that in a general sense, we've

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.840
all been called to follow Jesus, but we find that Matthew specifically, as we think about

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.119
the specific nature of the call that is mentioned here in Matthew 9, that He was called to be

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:16.559
an apostle.

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:19.520
We find that here in Matthew 9, He says, follow me.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.440
And we find that in chapter number 10, in verse number 1 through 3, He outlines the

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.840
names of those that He called to be as apostles.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.200
It says when He had called unto Him as 12 disciples, He gave them power against unclean

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.719
spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.880
Now, the names of the 12 apostles are these, the first, Simon, who is called Peter, Andrew

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.359
is brother, James, the son of Zebedee, and John is brother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:52.080
and then Nodus, and Matthew, the publican.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.599
Matthew was called specifically as an apostle.

00:19:56.599 --> 00:20:00.559
And we find that that was the specific call of God upon His life.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:05.839
And as we begin to think about the general sense, the general call that each of us as

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:08.899
the people of God, we've been called to follow Jesus.

00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:12.879
And so, are we following Jesus as we've been called to do so?

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:14.759
Are we studying His Word?

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:15.919
Are we in the Scriptures?

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:20.159
Have we denied ourselves, taken up our cross, and we're following Him?

00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:27.119
And then in the very specific sense for Matthew this morning, he's been called to be an apostle.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.199
The specific call that's been placed in his life, I could say clearly for all of us this

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:36.439
morning in a general sense that you've been called to follow Jesus, but you may not have

00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:41.999
been called to go serve in a particular mission field as a missionary or maybe as a pastor

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:46.119
or whatever it might be, but God places that specific call.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:51.159
I think about my own life, and I think about the fact that I got saved in 1997.

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:56.039
When I got saved, I became a child of God, and it was the will of God that I would follow

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:59.359
Jesus, that I'd follow Him.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:05.040
When I worked in the corporate world for years as I was serving the Lord, I was seeking to

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.199
follow Jesus because that's God's will for His people.

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:16.119
Then God placed a specific call in my life to be a pastor.

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:18.879
And we know that God's not going to call everybody to be a pastor.

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:24.159
I remember speaking with someone many years ago and talking about this very nature and

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.919
the fact that God's not going to call everyone to be a pastor, then who's going to be in

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:32.199
the church, right?

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:33.199
But someone said this.

00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:37.459
God's not going to call everyone to a full-time capacity, if we could use that terminology

00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:43.279
this morning, but you know, as the people of God, we ought to wrestle with the idea

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:47.239
of what does God really have…am I willing?

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:56.199
Am I willing to follow Jesus not simply in that general sense as all of us as the people

00:21:56.199 --> 00:22:02.919
of God, as His children, but specifically, if God were to call, are we going to answer

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:04.720
and respond?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.080
See, when I read this morning, by way of introduction, the truth of Matthew 9 with regard to the

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.000
prayer request in verse 37 and 38, I don't believe this morning that God has stopped

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
calling people.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Do you?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.080
I don't believe that God stopped calling missionaries.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.660
I don't believe that God stopped calling pastors.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.319
But yet you have mission fields that are in want of missionaries.

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:35.360
You have churches that have empty pulpits.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.639
I remember while I was in Bible college going and preaching right after…actually, it was

00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:44.599
right after Bible college, I remember going and preaching in some churches in some places

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:47.500
where they did not have a pastor.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.440
There were times that we'd go into a church for a weekend, Holly and I, and we'd go into

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.639
a church and they were without a pastor for over two years.

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:57.440
Can you imagine?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.080
Two years without a pastor?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.160
We find that God tells us that He's given pastors.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.099
We read it in Ephesians 4, we won't take time to turn there, but we find that He's calling.

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:17.539
I don't believe that some of the lack of laborers that we see is a result of God stopping

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:18.539
His call.

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:24.580
So, there's got to be a different reason, and it's the response of the people being

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.580
called.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.020
See, we're all called to follow Jesus.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:36.619
You might be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant, a whatever, law enforcement, first responder,

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:41.779
being in the medical field, whatever it might be, wherever God may have called you.

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:46.819
And that may be the means that God's using to provide for you and your family, but He

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:50.619
still has called you to be a follower of Jesus Christ.

00:23:50.619 --> 00:24:00.059
And He uses you in that place, in that situation, to be a light, to be His representative.

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:05.139
There are people that you will see this week in your workplace that unless they come and

00:24:05.139 --> 00:24:08.979
visit this church, I will probably never meet them.

00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:10.739
Just the way it works.

00:24:10.739 --> 00:24:17.619
And so God, in His sovereignty, He moves and He has His people, but in those places we're

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:20.540
still to be followers of Jesus Christ.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:27.019
My first and foremost goal is to understand that I'm following Jesus, but then God's going

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:30.100
to call some people as He did Matthew.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:35.660
I want you to notice as we think about the seriousness of this call and the impact that

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:42.100
it should have upon each of us as we consider, yes, it's a simple call, follow me, but oh,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:50.299
the seriousness of the call, that God is calling us as individuals to follow Him.

00:24:50.299 --> 00:25:01.100
I believe that if we would corporately, beyond even just our local church, but if believers

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:08.299
across this globe would seriously grab hold to this truth, and we'd understand the seriousness

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:15.500
of following Jesus, it'd make a world of difference in our society.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.579
We'd see a whole lot of people following Christ, seeking to exalt, and as I preached

00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:26.700
last week, magnifying the Lord in our lives, and what a joy.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.859
I know the simplicity and the seriousness of the call.

00:25:30.859 --> 00:25:35.019
Number three this morning, I want you to see the surrender of Matthew.

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.380
Notice the surrender of Matthew.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.540
It's summarized for us at the end of verse number nine.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.779
We've used it as our title this morning, and He arose and followed Him.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:51.779
I want you to think about the response and the surrender of Matthew here at the end of

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.179
verse number nine.

00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:57.299
We find that Matthew, of course, would be used of the Lord to, under the inspiration

00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:01.100
of the Holy Spirit of God, to pen the words of this particular book that we're looking

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.619
at this morning, and as we study the book of Matthew, I've already made note of the

00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:10.339
miracles of the eighth chapter, and then that miracle that starts chapter number nine.

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:16.260
There was no doubt, there was a certain buzz, if you will, about Jesus.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.820
There were things that were being spoken about, the miracles that had been performed, and

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.220
here this man, Matthew, he's sitting, the Bible tells us, at the receipt of custom,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.619
and so he's in a very busy area.

00:26:29.619 --> 00:26:31.940
There's lots of people that are passing by.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.160
No doubt he's heard some things about Jesus.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.320
No doubt he's heard about the miracles.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:43.359
No doubt he's heard about those that came and the leper that was cleansed in verse number

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:49.200
one through four of chapter number eight, the centurion that comes and says, Jesus,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.040
my servant is sick, and Jesus says, I'll come, and he says, no, no, no, I don't need you

00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.720
to come because I know that I have authority as a centurion and I can speak, and those

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.279
that are under my authority, they do what I say.

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:05.440
They go where I tell them to go.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.160
They follow my word, and you're God.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.480
You could just speak it.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480
What did Jesus do?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480
He just spoke it.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:21.419
The man is healed, and you go through and you see his power displayed, and you read

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:27.639
of the miracles, not only over disease, but over nature, as the eighth chapter records

00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:33.279
for us when they were there in that great tempest, and Jesus was asleep, and he said,

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:39.279
peace, be still, and you read about his power over demons and all of these things that have

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:46.480
taken place, and no doubt Matthew's heard some of this stuff.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.480
He's heard about what Jesus has been doing.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.639
I mean, this was big news.

00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:52.959
This was serious.

00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:58.320
This was, if I could use it, this was the talk of the town, right?

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:07.679
And Jesus passes by, and he says, follow me, follow me.

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:11.359
Now Matthew has a decision, does he not?

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:13.200
Matthew has a decision.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.440
Matthew can continue in the place where he is and he can say, you know what, I like my

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.880
life right now.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.079
I like the monetary gain that I have from this position that I have.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:31.040
I enjoy what it is that I'm doing, and thank you, but no thank you.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.359
I mean, he could have responded that way.

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:39.919
But we read at the end of verse number nine when he simply heard the words, follow me.

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:44.000
He arose and followed him.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.279
He arose and followed him.

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:53.799
This response at the end of verse number nine, I believe, is both commendable and exemplary.

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:59.719
We commend Matthew for his obedience, the faith that he had to leave that which he was

00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:00.719
doing.

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:02.679
Can you imagine the scene, if you will?

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:06.320
I mean, people that are passing by, and he's sitting there at the receipt of custom, and

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.279
Jesus says, follow me, and he just gets up and he follows him, leaving everything right

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:13.799
where it was.

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:17.520
It's commendable.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.880
It's also exemplary.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:27.039
There is nothing in my life or in your life that we hold on to too tight that we should

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:30.640
not be willing to surrender for God.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.000
Amen?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.320
Think about the song that we sang this morning.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:46.200
The last, when I surveyed the wondrous cross, the last verse, it says this, love so amazing,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.599
so divine.

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:59.960
The songwriter then said this, demands my soul, my life, my all.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.599
I think the songwriter...

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:03.839
hit it right on the head.

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:07.639
Is not His love so amazing and so divine?

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:11.439
We sang about, hallelujah, what a Savior.

00:30:11.439 --> 00:30:14.319
Man, and can it be,

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:16.019
we didn't sing that song this morning,

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:17.859
but you're familiar with it.

00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:21.739
His amazing love that He'd love someone like us,

00:30:21.739 --> 00:30:24.039
but God commendeth His love toward us

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.659
and that while we were yet sinners,

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:28.159
Christ died for us.

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:30.819
The songwriter says His love is so amazing,

00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:32.259
it's so divine,

00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:38.339
that it demands my soul, my life, my all.

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:41.139
There is nothing that we should cherish.

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:43.459
There is nothing that we should desire

00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:48.459
more than Jesus.

00:30:48.459 --> 00:30:51.799
We find that as we look at the response of Matthew,

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:53.679
I've noted that it's commendable

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:54.979
and that it's exemplary,

00:30:54.979 --> 00:30:57.219
but his response of obedience

00:30:57.239 --> 00:31:00.899
had a profound impact on his life.

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:02.659
I want you to notice the next few verses

00:31:02.659 --> 00:31:05.279
as we finish up our study this morning

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.379
of this passage of Scripture.

00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:09.619
I would say this,

00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:12.299
the response of Matthew,

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:14.419
the surrender of Matthew,

00:31:14.419 --> 00:31:16.599
it had a impact in his life

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:19.419
and it changed his profession.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:21.419
His profession changed.

00:31:21.419 --> 00:31:25.059
The Bible tells us that he was a publican,

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:26.499
he was a tax collector,

00:31:26.579 --> 00:31:28.779
he's sitting at the receipt of custom,

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:31.979
but we know that he's no longer going to fulfill,

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:34.759
he's no longer going to be engaged

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.219
in that line of work.

00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:40.819
He's now going to be an apostle.

00:31:40.819 --> 00:31:44.939
It's amazing.

00:31:44.939 --> 00:31:48.779
And we think about the specific call of Matthew.

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:50.779
Again, this morning, in a general sense,

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.419
God's calling you to follow Him,

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:54.339
but for some, God is calling

00:31:54.819 --> 00:31:57.299
in a full-time capacity.

00:31:57.299 --> 00:32:01.579
I remember, I knew that God called me

00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:03.539
to full-time ministry well before

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:06.739
I ever got a call from Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:08.259
I knew that God had called me,

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.699
I had prepared in Bible college,

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.019
I was surrendered to what the Lord would want

00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:14.219
and God had me working in churches,

00:32:14.219 --> 00:32:15.899
He had me working in the corporate world

00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:18.619
and I worked in the corporate world for years.

00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:20.619
And I remember as I worked in the corporate world

00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:22.019
wondering from time to time,

00:32:22.019 --> 00:32:23.939
Lord, when?

00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:26.619
You didn't forget about me.

00:32:26.619 --> 00:32:29.059
And I remember God making it abundantly clear

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:33.059
that it was time.

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:35.179
And Holly and I, we were surrendered.

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:37.139
Lord, where do You want us?

00:32:37.139 --> 00:32:39.099
I remember going over to my parents' house

00:32:39.099 --> 00:32:41.699
and talking to them about coming to

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:43.139
a church in Oakton, Virginia

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:45.579
that was looking for a pastor.

00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:47.419
I remember the conversation.

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:49.219
I remember them asking,

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:52.059
are you guys alright financially to do that?

00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:54.219
Moms and dads are concerned about that.

00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:57.259
As they should be.

00:32:57.259 --> 00:33:00.259
We talked and we prayed.

00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:02.659
We're praying for the will of God.

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:05.099
And I remember as some of you that were here then,

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:08.299
you know the events and how it all worked out.

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:11.499
It was amazing because for months

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:14.339
after we knew it was time,

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:17.379
there's really no opportunity.

00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:18.699
The counsel that I received was

00:33:18.699 --> 00:33:20.259
don't send a resume to anyone.

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:21.379
God knows where you are

00:33:21.379 --> 00:33:23.619
and He knows where you need to be.

00:33:23.619 --> 00:33:25.499
And so we're just waiting on God.

00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:28.379
Asking God to open a door.

00:33:28.379 --> 00:33:30.299
Now for some of you that have the same kind of personality

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:33.419
that I do, that's hard.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:36.219
Because sometimes we think we can help God.

00:33:36.219 --> 00:33:37.099
Right?

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.739
If you have the kind of personality I have,

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:39.699
you understand.

00:33:39.699 --> 00:33:41.899
You can relate.

00:33:41.899 --> 00:33:42.899
I was working in the corporate world.

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:47.499
Everything was about networking.

00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:49.939
Or just trusting God.

00:33:49.939 --> 00:33:51.659
But when God opened the door,

00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:53.859
it was fast.

00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:56.459
Seriously, it was fast.

00:33:56.459 --> 00:34:01.179
And I remember going and telling my boss,

00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:04.939
here's my resignation.

00:34:04.939 --> 00:34:06.779
I'm leaving.

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:07.779
You're leaving?

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:09.019
What are you doing?

00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:11.419
I'm going to go pastor a church.

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:14.259
You're crazy.

00:34:14.259 --> 00:34:17.899
I'm not accepting your resignation.

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:20.139
Now I didn't know that an employer could say

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:21.139
they weren't going to accept.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.619
I didn't have any kind of contract.

00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:25.499
I'm not accepting your resignation.

00:34:25.499 --> 00:34:27.059
You need to go talk to.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:28.699
And they just kept sending me to the next boss

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.939
and the next boss and the next boss.

00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:34.259
Because they didn't want to accept my resignation.

00:34:34.259 --> 00:34:36.579
But God was changing my profession,

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:41.619
quote unquote, if I could use that term this morning.

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:43.019
And I remember sitting in the office

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:47.259
and the guy that was four or five levels above me

00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:49.099
making all kinds of statements

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:51.819
and where you could be in so many years

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:54.379
and so on and so forth.

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:55.539
What was he trying to do?

00:34:55.539 --> 00:34:59.979
He was trying to convince me to stay.

00:34:59.979 --> 00:35:01.219
Look at what the possibilities are.

00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:03.899
Look at what the opportunities are before you.

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:05.699
I mean, the future's bright for you.

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:07.779
Why would you do this?

00:35:07.779 --> 00:35:11.539
Because God called me.

00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:14.819
It was really kind of simple.

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:17.819
Because I knew that God called me.

00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:20.699
And we see here for Matthew,

00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:22.779
his profession changed.

00:35:22.779 --> 00:35:24.539
But not only did his profession change,

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.899
and I think for the next two thoughts here

00:35:26.899 --> 00:35:29.659
as we go through the remainder of this little text

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:30.899
of scripture this morning,

00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:32.819
this will be the truth for each of us

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:35.499
whether we're speaking in a general sense

00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:37.179
of following the Lord Jesus Christ

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:39.859
or in the specific sense of being an apostle

00:35:39.859 --> 00:35:43.659
or a full-time ministry type of situation of Matthew here,

00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:45.819
I want you to notice not only did his profession change,

00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:48.379
but his perspective changed.

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.179
His perspective changed.

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:52.219
See, I want you to think about Matthew just for a moment.

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:55.019
I want you to think about how he viewed people.

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.779
In his line of work and what he did as a tax collector,

00:35:57.779 --> 00:36:00.099
really, people were simply a means

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:01.859
by which he obtained his wealth.

00:36:04.019 --> 00:36:04.859
Right?

00:36:04.859 --> 00:36:05.699
That's just what it was.

00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:08.299
He's just taxing people.

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.699
He's collecting the taxes.

00:36:10.539 --> 00:36:12.139
He was levying the taxes.

00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:15.139
And we find that he's now going

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:17.699
to have a change of perspective.

00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:18.539
Why?

00:36:18.539 --> 00:36:21.059
Because these people no longer are just the means

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:24.219
by which I'm going to receive my wealth.

00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:27.459
These people are people that are in need of a savior.

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:31.019
People ask me often,

00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:33.779
how do you like Northern Virginia?

00:36:33.779 --> 00:36:35.299
Too many people there.

00:36:35.299 --> 00:36:36.299
I get that all the time.

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:38.219
Pastors all through Virginia.

00:36:38.219 --> 00:36:40.219
We had our pastors meeting here in July,

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:42.819
and people, oh, we got to go to Northern Virginia.

00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:46.979
How do you handle the traffic in Northern Virginia?

00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:48.939
And it's been exciting with all the construction, right?

00:36:48.939 --> 00:36:50.699
I mean, it's just a blessing.

00:36:52.699 --> 00:36:55.499
You know what I've told people over the years?

00:36:55.499 --> 00:36:59.459
As frustrating as it is, each car represents people.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:02.219
You know what ministry is about?

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.819
It's about people.

00:37:03.819 --> 00:37:05.579
It's about people.

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:08.379
And if there are no people, there are no ministry.

00:37:09.419 --> 00:37:11.019
Right?

00:37:11.019 --> 00:37:13.939
And there are so many people.

00:37:13.939 --> 00:37:18.539
And now the perspective of Matthew changes.

00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:20.019
Not only does his perspective,

00:37:20.019 --> 00:37:23.139
but I believe his priorities change.

00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:24.419
His priorities change.

00:37:24.419 --> 00:37:29.419
We find that he's going to host this large dinner party.

00:37:29.459 --> 00:37:31.859
The Bible in Luke 5 in verse number 29,

00:37:31.859 --> 00:37:33.099
you don't need to turn there,

00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:34.819
but it makes it abundantly clear

00:37:34.899 --> 00:37:36.899
that the house that they're going to have meat in,

00:37:36.899 --> 00:37:38.979
according to verse number 10 of Matthew 9,

00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:40.819
is Matthew's house.

00:37:40.819 --> 00:37:43.499
And the Bible tells us of the feast,

00:37:43.499 --> 00:37:45.259
of the dinner that they're going to have,

00:37:45.259 --> 00:37:49.739
in Luke 5 verse 29, it calls it a great feast.

00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:54.619
Matthew's going to host this dinner party, if you will,

00:37:54.619 --> 00:37:58.099
at a cost to himself for the purpose

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:00.779
of bringing people into contact with the Savior.

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:03.219
That's a change of perspective.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:05.539
That's a change of priority.

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:09.099
And as we're following the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives,

00:38:09.099 --> 00:38:10.459
as we understand that he said,

00:38:10.459 --> 00:38:13.859
follow me to each of us as his children,

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:16.379
we're going to have a difference in our perspective

00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:19.539
and in our priorities as we're following Christ.

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:22.779
And we find that it tells us in verse number 10,

00:38:22.779 --> 00:38:25.819
and it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house,

00:38:25.819 --> 00:38:27.099
behold, notice what it says,

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:30.059
many publicans and sinners came

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:33.019
and sat down with him and his disciples.

00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:36.380
It seems clear to me that obviously as Matthew

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.940
in his profession, his occupation, he was a wealthy man.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.659
He had the means of hosting this dinner party

00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:46.619
and having them there and providing this great feast,

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:51.339
but now he's using the funds in order to bring people

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:53.779
into the presence of the Savior.

00:38:53.779 --> 00:38:58.219
It's amazing at what his perspective and his priorities

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.019
and how it's changed.

00:39:00.019 --> 00:39:03.099
And the Bible tells us that when the Pharisees saw it

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:05.259
in verse number 11, they said to his disciples,

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:08.539
why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:11.819
I made the statement as we were reading through the text

00:39:11.819 --> 00:39:14.179
at the introduction this morning,

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:17.219
that I'm thankful that Christ came to seek

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:19.380
and to save that which was lost.

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:21.819
Because we're all sinners.

00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:25.259
I've said many times over the years,

00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:30.259
there are but two groups of people upon the earth.

00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:34.539
There are those that are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:38.099
and those that are lost still in their sin.

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:41.659
I'm thankful to be saved.

00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:43.579
I'm thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:45.380
as my personal Savior.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.539
There are many people, however, that do not know Jesus.

00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:53.019
In Matthew, in following the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:39:53.019 --> 00:39:57.619
he has the perspective and the priority

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:00.619
of trying to bring people to the Savior.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:05.739
And Jesus is there eating with them, these religious leaders, they are criticizing and

00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:08.259
critiquing the behavior of Jesus.

00:40:08.259 --> 00:40:11.259
And Jesus heard what they said and He responds to them.

00:40:11.259 --> 00:40:15.179
He says, they that behold me not a physician, but they that are sick.

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:18.299
And then He says to them, but go ye and learn what that meaneth.

00:40:18.299 --> 00:40:22.219
If you have heard the term about phylacteries and so on and so forth, you'd find that a

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:27.379
lot of these Pharisees, they would wear scripture on their person.

00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:31.239
And they would have scripture upon them on their robes and what have you.

00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:37.019
And it would seem obvious that they had this portion of scripture from the Old Testament

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:40.699
where it says, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.

00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:44.179
And Jesus says, go and learn what that meaneth.

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:46.059
I will have mercy and not sacrifice.

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:54.979
And then Jesus says this, I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

00:40:54.979 --> 00:40:59.819
I'm so thankful that Jesus loves sinners.

00:40:59.819 --> 00:41:04.579
And if we love Jesus, we love what Jesus loves, amen?

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:10.499
And we ought to desire to reach people with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:41:10.499 --> 00:41:19.739
And as He's called us to follow Him, He said to Peter, follow me and I will make you fishers

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:21.519
of men.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:23.859
No longer, Peter, you're going to be catching fish.

00:41:23.859 --> 00:41:25.979
You're going to be fishing for men.

00:41:25.979 --> 00:41:26.979
Isn't that wonderful?

00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:33.219
And we know Peter had that difficulty after the crucifixion and what have you, and he

00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:35.539
said, I go a fishing.

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:40.379
But Jesus graciously, at the end of the book of John, Jesus graciously meets him on the

00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:41.379
shore.

00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:48.699
You know, He says to him, follow me, feed my sheep, feed my sheep, follow me.

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:53.019
Jesus is saying to us this morning, follow me.

00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:57.659
If we're going to follow Him, it requires surrender.

00:41:57.659 --> 00:42:01.779
Absolutely essential, it requires surrender.

00:42:01.779 --> 00:42:03.879
Why would I surrender?

00:42:03.879 --> 00:42:12.659
Why would I be willing to surrender these things and to follow the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:15.080
He's worthy of it.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.979
He's commanded it.

00:42:17.979 --> 00:42:20.419
The songwriters have said it so well.

00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:27.779
We sing, actually, many times several of these songs, follow, follow, I would follow

00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:29.940
Jesus.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:36.619
We sing, anywhere, everywhere, I will follow on.

00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:41.360
Everywhere He leads me, I will follow on.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.179
We sing, where He leads me, I will follow.

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:49.099
We sing, I have decided to follow Jesus.

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:52.419
No turning back, no turning back.

00:42:52.419 --> 00:42:56.899
I love the testimony of Caleb in the Old Testament.

00:42:56.899 --> 00:43:06.779
He's a man that God says He wholly followed the Lord His God, wholly, entirely, completely.

00:43:06.779 --> 00:43:12.619
When it was only he and Joshua followed the Lord.

00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:16.119
The other ten, no, no, no, we can't.

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:20.679
The whole congregation is going to stone him.

00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:24.919
No God is able, we're following.

00:43:24.919 --> 00:43:30.559
Joshua and Caleb were the only two from that generation that made it into the land of promise.

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:37.099
And it says, if you study the life of Caleb, just think about the term that's used so repeatedly

00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:43.839
that he wholly followed the Lord, that completeness of following the Lord.

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:49.279
I'll close with this passage, 2 Corinthians 5.

00:43:49.279 --> 00:43:56.279
The Bible tells us, beginning in verse number 14 of 2 Corinthians 5, the love of Christ

00:43:56.279 --> 00:44:03.360
constraineth us, because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.959
And verse 15 is a verse of Scripture that for many years now I have claimed, if you

00:44:07.959 --> 00:44:13.959
will, as a life verse, if you've received any correspondence from me over the years,

00:44:13.959 --> 00:44:20.679
I repeatedly sign with this verse of Scripture, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 15.

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:30.839
And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:44:30.839 --> 00:44:34.440
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:41.239
I want to follow Jesus, be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:47.000
I did it for many years, working in the corporate world.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.919
I did it for many years without the specific call as a profession, if you will.

00:44:54.919 --> 00:44:57.799
It's a blessing to follow Jesus.

00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:02.160
You say, it's challenging, I understand, but isn't it wonderful to follow Him and to know

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.639
that He's with you?

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:06.479
He'll assist you.

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:07.479
He's there with you.

00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:15.440
And you follow Jesus, and He will use you to bring honor and glory to Himself, and that's

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.720
what it's all about ultimately.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.320
He'll use you to bring sinners into His presence.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.320
Let me tell you about my Savior.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.600
Hallelujah, what a Savior.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600
Let's pray.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.079
Father, we love you.

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:32.399
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:47.519
We thank you for the call in Matthew's life, simple yet serious, challenged by the surrender

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:48.519
of Matthew.

00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:51.679
He arose and followed.

00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:58.279
God, I pray that you'd help each of us this morning to follow you.

00:45:58.279 --> 00:46:09.919
Lord, many that are here this morning that you've called them to a particular profession,

00:46:09.919 --> 00:46:16.880
but greater than that profession, you've called them to follow you in that profession, to

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:26.279
be a doctor that follows Jesus, to be a nurse that follows Jesus, to be an accountant, a

00:46:26.279 --> 00:46:36.359
lawyer, a military first responder, whatever it is, to follow Jesus.

00:46:36.359 --> 00:46:44.279
Perhaps this morning you've placed a more specific call in someone's heart and life.

00:46:44.279 --> 00:46:48.399
A call such as what you placed upon Matthew's life in this text of Scripture.

00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:55.639
Oh, God, I pray that if that would be the case, that they'd respond in obedience, surrender.

00:46:55.639 --> 00:46:58.359
Lord, help each of us.

00:46:58.359 --> 00:47:02.720
We so often sing the song, I surrender all.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:10.199
I hope that as we sing that song, that we sing it in truth.

00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:12.959
There's nothing that we hold on to.

00:47:12.959 --> 00:47:17.760
We would not be willing to give up to follow you.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.440
Use us, God, for your honor and for your glory.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.079
Work in the time of invitation as only you can.

00:47:23.079 --> 00:47:24.600
We'll thank you for it.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.119
Would you stand with me?
