1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,579
And this morning, we're gonna deal with our service

2
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:04,420
to the Lord.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,119
I've titled the message for the audience of one,

4
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,420
for the audience of one.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,079
And I hope that as we go through the message this morning,

6
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,520
that that title will be abundantly clear to you

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,700
as what I'm seeking to communicate through this message

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,639
for the audience of one.

9
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,760
For the last three weeks,

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
we had the opportunity minus last Sunday,

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,520
but as we've dealt with this third phase, if you will,

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,180
for our annual theme,

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,940
the great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,500
We discovered his greatness.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,299
We spoke about the importance of declaring his greatness.

16
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,680
And then for this third phase,

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,540
we've dealt with the subject of how God's greatness

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,459
will impact our lives.

19
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,459
And I believe that when we understand how great he is,

20
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,500
it should have an impact on each of us.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,979
For indeed it is true that what we believe

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,139
will impact our behavior.

23
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,000
For three weeks,

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,220
we spent time looking at the subject matter of prayer.

25
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,099
And there were several times that we noted

26
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,419
that what we believe to be true about God,

27
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,860
and we find that in his precious word

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,019
will impact how we pray.

29
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,580
We pray that God will move mountains because he can,

30
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,019
because he's God, because he has all power,

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,839
because he's reigning and ruling.

32
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,620
We pray that God would save sinners because he's able.

33
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,540
And you think about the way that we pray,

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,900
it's based upon what we believe to be true

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,360
about God's word, about who God is.

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,180
We find that we've looked at David,

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,059
the life of David in Psalm 32.

38
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,720
We look at the life of Daniel.

39
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,519
Why did Daniel have such confidence in praying

40
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,660
that God would show him not only the dream,

41
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,760
but the interpretation of the dream,

42
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,300
because he knew who God was.

43
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,559
He knew who God was.

44
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:42,360
And therefore he prayed that God would give an answer.

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
And guess what God did.

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,279
And Daniel did not stand before Nebuchadnezzar

47
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,400
and say that I'm able.

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,239
He said, there's a God in heaven and praise the Lord.

49
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,080
He's still there.

50
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,019
He rules and he reigns and he's able.

51
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,339
We had the opportunity to look at the life of Paul.

52
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,379
And we dealt with the subject matter of a life

53
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,980
marked by prayer.

54
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,220
And we looked at his life.

55
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,739
And as we were challenged through those messages

56
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,620
to examine our own prayer lives,

57
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,500
and in order to determine how our prayer lives

58
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,139
have been shaped, have been impacted

59
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,139
by what God has given to us in his word

60
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,220
about how great he is.

61
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,940
What is it that's on your prayer list?

62
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,820
What is it that we're praying about right now

63
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,899
that only God can do?

64
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:25,220
And that really will impact as we examine these things,

65
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:26,899
how we pray.

66
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:29,460
This morning, I'd like to move into a second thought

67
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,460
and that would be our service to God.

68
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,179
You know, it's a privilege to serve God.

69
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:38,059
And I would say this morning that when I truly understand

70
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:42,179
how great our God is, it should impact how I serve him.

71
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,139
I'm not just serving a mere human.

72
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm not just serving some false idol.

73
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,720
No, I'm serving the great I am.

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,979
I'm serving the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

75
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:54,699
And as we consider that thought this morning

76
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,860
and understanding that as we serve God,

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,539
we must never lose sight of the fact

78
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,300
that we are serving God.

79
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,539
Yes, will our service be to people?

80
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,740
No doubt.

81
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,740
But ultimately, our service is for the audience of one.

82
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,460
It's for God.

83
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,179
What a privilege it is to serve the Lord.

84
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,539
Notice in Ephesians chapter two,

85
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,139
we're familiar with verses eight and nine.

86
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,500
I'll read them together with verse number 10.

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,179
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith.

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,139
And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

89
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,059
not of works, lest any man should boast.

90
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,619
Notice verse 10, for we are his workmanship,

91
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:37,419
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

92
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,419
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

93
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,380
So we're gonna think about this truth

94
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
of our service to the Lord.

95
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,880
I want you to consider just a few thoughts

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
with me this morning.

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,240
Number one, we should review our attitude

98
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,720
towards serving the Lord.

99
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,160
We should review our attitude towards serving the Lord.

100
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,520
In other words, we understand, the Bible says here,

101
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,240
we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus,

102
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,919
notice, unto good works, which God hath before ordained

103
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,720
that we should walk in them.

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Before salvation, before you trust

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,679
that Christ is your Savior,

106
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,720
before I trust that Christ is my Savior,

107
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,359
if you're here this morning and you've not yet been saved,

108
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,320
according to the Bible in Romans six and verse number 17,

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,040
I was a servant of sin, but in Christ.

110
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,720
According to Romans 6, 18,

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,359
no longer am I a servant of sin,

112
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,559
but now I serve the Lord Jesus Christ

113
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,640
and I am a servant of righteousness.

114
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,559
And you know, the reality is I'd much rather

115
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,799
be a servant of righteousness than a servant of sin.

116
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,720
And we find that truth to be there for us

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
in Romans six, verse 17 and 18.

118
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,959
But when we understand this truth about serving the Lord

119
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,119
and reviewing our attitude towards our service,

120
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:54,559
I wonder this morning, do we have the perspective

121
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,720
that I have to serve the Lord,

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,359
or do we have the perspective that I get to serve the Lord?

123
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,920
There's a great difference between having that perspective

124
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,000
that I have to do this,

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,959
and sometimes when we take that perspective,

126
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,619
it becomes overbearing, it becomes duty,

127
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,600
it's just difficult and maybe with drudgery,

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,079
but when we have the perspective,

129
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,260
when we review our attitude and understand

130
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,179
that we are his workmanship,

131
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,220
that God has created us for this,

132
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,899
that he has designed it to be so,

133
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,700
then I say, I get to serve the Lord.

134
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,899
I get to serve Christ.

135
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,380
What a privilege, what a blessing.

136
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,820
We find this morning that the Bible is abundantly clear.

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,260
When we think about this truth of our service to God,

138
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,940
we do not serve the Lord to get saved.

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,779
Ephesians two and eight in verse eight and nine

140
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,339
are quite clear that the Bible says,

141
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:49,420
for by grace are you saved through faith,

142
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,380
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

143
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,040
not of works, lest any man should be saved,

144
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,140
lest any man should boast,

145
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,299
and so we think about Ephesians two, verses eight and nine,

146
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,619
we understand the Bible is abundantly clear

147
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,579
when we speak about our service to God.

148
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,279
It's not so that you can be saved.

149
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,579
It's not even that you could stay saved.

150
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,220
See, you can't serve God to stay saved

151
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,660
just like you can't serve God to get saved.

152
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,399
The Bible tells us in 1 Peter one, verses four and five,

153
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,839
that we are kept by the power of God.

154
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,500
We find that we have an inheritance

155
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,859
that's reserved in heaven for us.

156
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:29,459
I cannot work to be saved, nor can I work to stay saved,

157
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,660
but when we understand and we examine,

158
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,239
we review our attitude towards serving the Lord,

159
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,100
we understand this morning that we get to serve God

160
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,579
because we are saved.

161
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,540
It's the result of being saved

162
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,100
that gives us the privilege and the opportunity

163
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,059
to serve the master, to serve the king of kings

164
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,859
and Lord of lords, and what a great privilege it is.

165
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,220
But at times, if we're not careful,

166
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
our attitude can kind of get sideways

167
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,760
with regard to service.

168
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,579
We can kind of get into the drudgery

169
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,940
and the monotony, if you will,

170
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,619
and we can get overwhelmed with it,

171
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,540
and we lose our focus that we're serving the Lord,

172
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,579
we're serving the master, and what a blessing.

173
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,359
Think about the perspective, if you will,

174
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,679
of the psalmist, or Psalm 84,

175
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,619
and I want you to look at a couple of verses

176
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,839
within the Psalms, because really,

177
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,839
I hope this morning that your service for Christ

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,179
is a delight, that it's a delight.

179
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,420
We understand that God has designed it

180
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,679
that his children would serve him,

181
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,320
and what a blessing it is, and you say,

182
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,279
as we look at this truth of serving the Lord,

183
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,640
we understand that it comes,

184
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,799
and we'll look at our next point,

185
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:39,160
it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes,

186
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,839
and everyone's service is not the same,

187
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,880
but what a privilege it is to serve the Lord,

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,040
and it should be a delight.

189
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
In Psalm 84, notice in verse number 10,

190
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,440
the Bible says, for a day in thy court

191
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,679
is better than a thousand.

192
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:57,500
I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God

193
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,519
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

194
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,239
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

195
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,720
The psalmist says that they'd rather be a doorkeeper

196
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,720
in the house of my God, a doorkeeper.

197
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,679
You say, well, that's kind of a,

198
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,260
no, no, no, that's a service to the king.

199
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,760
It's a privilege, it's a delight

200
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
to be able to serve the Lord,

201
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
and you think about the perspective here.

202
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,019
It says I'd rather do that

203
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,299
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

204
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,440
I want you to think about your service to the Lord,

205
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,079
and the reality is that, listen,

206
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,640
I'd rather clean bathrooms for the Lord

207
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,400
than do something else for the world, amen,

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,760
and what a delight.

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,359
Somebody came to me not long ago and said,

210
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,679
pastor, what can I do?

211
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,080
I'll clean toilets, I'll clean this, I'll do that,

212
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,320
whatever, I just wanna serve the Lord,

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,559
and praise the Lord for that kind of perspective

214
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,440
because why, it's a privilege to serve God.

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,799
It is an absolute privilege.

216
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,039
The psalmist says here in Psalm 84,

217
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,020
what he would rather do,

218
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,760
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God.

219
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,159
I want you to think about Psalm 100,

220
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,960
and of course, we're familiar with that psalm.

221
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,840
It's a very familiar psalm to us,

222
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,440
but I want you to see what the psalmist says

223
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,479
in Psalm 100 in verse number two.

224
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,099
The Bible says this, serve the Lord how?

225
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,919
With gladness, with gladness.

226
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,640
Come before his presence with singing,

227
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,520
and we think about this truth

228
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,359
as we review our attitude towards serving the Lord.

229
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,479
I get to do this, I get to serve God.

230
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,239
I can do it with gladness, and why?

231
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:31,760
Because my perspective is that it's for the audience of one,

232
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,739
for the audience of one.

233
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm serving the Lord.

234
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,599
I have the privilege of being able to serve Christ.

235
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,119
You say, well, as the pastor, you get to,

236
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,440
no, no, listen, we get to serve Christ.

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,859
There were many a day after I trusted Christ as my savior,

238
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,320
I was an usher at our church,

239
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
the first church I ever went to after I got saved,

240
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,520
and I was an usher at that church as a teenager,

241
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,440
and you know what the job of the ushers were?

242
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,159
All the ushers are gonna get scared this morning.

243
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,320
The job of the ushers every Saturday morning

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,159
was to go to the church house and clean the house,

245
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,760
the church house, and we went to that church house.

246
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,000
church house, all the ushers, we get together on Saturday morning early before visitation and we'd

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,560
get there and we'd spend a couple of hours before visitation cleaning that church house. Then we go

248
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,520
on visitation, we come back after visitation and we clean the church house some more. And you know

249
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,520
it was a delight. It was just a joy to be able to serve the Lord. And at times we must review

250
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,120
our attitude towards serving the Lord because we don't want to get bogged down in the work.

251
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,600
We don't want to get overwhelmed. We don't want to look at the wrong thing. We want to remind

252
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,280
ourselves that we're serving the Lord, that it's for the audience of one. I don't have to,

253
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,240
but I get to. It's a great perspective in life. Number two, we must rejoice for the ability to

254
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,880
serve the Lord. Rejoice for the ability to serve the Lord. You know it's God who has gifted each

255
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,880
of his children and given us the ability to serve him. And as I begin to think about that truth

256
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,400
and we understand this morning that we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus notice unto

257
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,680
good works. And then at the end of verse number 10 of Ephesians 2 it says, which God hath before

258
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:11,800
ordained that we should walk in them. And this is great for us to rejoice in having the ability

259
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:19,480
to serve the Lord. So I can't do what I used to do. God knows that. There's a great Bible

260
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,320
character that we're familiar with. We won't take the time to go to the book of Joshua,

261
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,240
but you understand in the life of Joshua that there comes a time in Joshua's life,

262
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,880
he was the human leader for the nation of Israel. He's the one that leads the children of Israel

263
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,080
into the land of promise. He's the one that leads the children of Israel into all the battles that

264
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,560
we read in the beginning of the book of Joshua and all of that. But there comes a time when God

265
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:50,120
says to Joshua, you're old. You're old. He no longer was going to go out and lead in battles,

266
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,960
but what was he going to do? He's going to divide the land. That was his duty. That was

267
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,160
his responsibility. And guess what we find about Joshua? He was faithful to lead the children of

268
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:08,520
Israel into battle, but as his life stages changed, he was faithful to serve God in dividing the land.

269
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,960
If you're to study the book of Joshua, the latter part of the book, you'll find that there's some

270
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,080
children, some tribes of the nation of Israel that kind of just sat around and they didn't do

271
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,760
anything. And Joshua said, hey, what's going on? Aren't you going to go and claim your land,

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,760
claim your inheritance? And he was used of God. And then he challenges the people before his death

273
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,040
on serving the Lord. There are different stages that you see in the life of Joshua

274
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,680
through that book of Joshua. And you find that all along the way, he's serving the Lord. Is it

275
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,240
in different ways? Absolutely. But he's still serving God. And he had the ability to do what

276
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,880
God called him to do at that time. Why? Because God equipped him and God enabled him for the task

277
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,360
that was at hand. God equipped him and God enabled him for the battles that took place in the

278
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,320
beginning of the book of Joshua. But then God enabled and equipped him for the division of the

279
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,120
land that you read of in the midst of the book of Joshua. And then God equipped and enabled him to

280
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,400
deliver those challenging messages to the two and a half tribes and to the leaders and the people

281
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,200
of Israel before he would die. God enabled him. God equipped him. And God equips and enables each

282
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,040
of us. Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will. And I want to go through a few verses here

283
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,480
in the book of 1 Corinthians. And it's interesting as we look at this particular book, the church in

284
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,200
Corinth, as we understand, turn to chapter number one to begin. But the church of Corinth is not a

285
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,120
model church. The church in Corinth has lots of problems. The church in Corinth is being corrected

286
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,360
for a lot of things that they're doing wrong. And the Lord would use the apostle Paul to pen

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,280
this book in order to give them instruction with regard to how they were to serve the Lord and what

288
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,720
was to take place. But when we understand and we're rejoicing for the ability to serve the Lord,

289
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,400
I want you to see what God says to the people at Corinth with regard to their service. In verse

290
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,680
number four of 1 Corinthians 1, notice what Paul says to these believers under the inspiration of

291
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,760
the Holy Spirit of God. He says, I thank my God always on your behalf. Notice this, for the grace

292
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:22,680
of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. I would submit to you this morning that that grace of God

293
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,960
which is given you by Jesus Christ is not only saving grace, though it encompasses that, but it's

294
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,800
also serving grace and the ability to serve the Lord. Paul talks about the grace that was bestowed

295
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,119
upon him. At the end of this book, we find that Peter mentions about being a

296
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:45,720
good steward of the manifold grace of God. And we find here that he's speaking about, notice, the

297
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,440
grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. That in everything, verse number five, ye are

298
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,440
enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was

299
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,720
confirmed in you. Notice verse seven, so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of

300
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,000
our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, as you study the book of 1 Corinthians, you find that one of the reasons

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,040
that there's some division and some jealousy and envy within the members of the church at Corinth

302
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,800
is because of the subject of spiritual gifts. Some were saying, well, I have this gift and you

303
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,559
have that gift and my gift is better than your gift and so on and so forth. And we'll look at a

304
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,200
few verses because the apostle Paul is going to deal with that and try to help them. But I want

305
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,240
you to notice as we speak about the ability to serve God and how we ought to rejoice that he's

306
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,160
given us the ability to serve the Lord, that it is God who has given us the grace. It is God who has

307
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,600
given us the ability. He has equipped us. And it says here of the church in Corinth that they come

308
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,720
behind in no gift. This church that was full of division and envy was a church that was gifted

309
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,720
spiritually. But they allowed those spiritual gifts to cause them to look at each other and say,

310
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm better than you because of the gift that I have. And they totally missed the purpose for which

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,720
God gave them the spiritual gifts in the first place. Notice in chapter number 4 of 1 Corinthians

312
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,080
verses 6 and 7, notice what the Bible says here. In chapter 4, 1 Corinthians 4 verse 6 and 7,

313
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,440
the Bible says this, and these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to

314
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,480
Apollos for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written,

315
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,040
that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. He's dealing with the importance of

316
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,160
humility. And notice in verse 7 he says, for who maketh thee to differ from another? By the way,

317
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,119
aren't you happy everyone's not like you? Amen. I'm happy everyone's not like me. I'm happy

318
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:54,040
everyone's not like you. I'm happy I'm not like you. Amen. But the reality is God's made us

319
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,640
different. But then notice when we think about the spiritual gifts, notice in verse number 7,

320
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,800
and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? He's going to build upon this as we go through

321
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,279
the book of 1 Corinthians, and we'll look at a few more verses. He says, now if thou didst receive

322
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,279
it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it? And we find that he's speaking,

323
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,360
we look at this idea of the ability to serve the Lord, and we rejoice that God's given us

324
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,000
the ability. Why? Because it's God who has equipped us. It is God who has enabled us.

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Think about this, the God of the universe, the one who spoke it all into existence,

326
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,520
the one who formed man from the dust of the ground and then breathed the life into them

327
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:45,080
through the breath of God, that he would allow us, he would allow you to serve him. It's amazing

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,360
that he would allow us to serve him in any capacity. It's amazing the ability that he's

329
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,160
given us to serve him. In 1 Corinthians chapter 12, notice as he continues to help this group

330
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,400
of believers in Corinth to understand the subject matter of spiritual gifts and to understand

331
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,559
the ability that God had given them to be able to serve the Lord. Remember, we don't serve God,

332
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,600
we don't do good works to be saved, we don't serve the Lord or do good works to stay saved,

333
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,040
but because we are saved, we are to serve Christ. We are to do good works. Notice in 1 Corinthians 12,

334
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,520
now, verse number one, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

335
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,000
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,679
Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus a

337
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,760
curse, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are

338
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,000
diversities of gifts, but notice this, the same Spirit. Verse number five, and there are differences

339
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,200
of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same

340
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,119
God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit

341
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,559
with all. Every man has been equipped and enabled to be able to serve Christ. Every child of God.

342
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,440
Remember the book of 1 Corinthians has been written to save people, to people that have been

343
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,119
born again, saved by the grace of God. And he says that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to

344
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:35,559
every man to profit with all. For to one, notice verse eight, is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom.

345
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,840
To another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit. To another, faith by the same Spirit. To

346
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,559
another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit. To another, the working of miracles. To another, prophecy.

347
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,320
To another, discerning of spirits. To another, diverse kinds of tongues. To another, the

348
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,400
interpretation of tongues. Now I'm not going to get into all the spiritual gifts this morning,

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,320
but understand that some of those were temporary sign gifts. The gift of healing, the gift of

350
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,679
tongues, those are temporary.

351
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,919
sign gifts. We think about even the gift of prophecy with regard to

352
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,399
foretelling versus what we would look at it today as being

353
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:14,479
foretelling. We see that those things have ceased. In fact, as you read through

354
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,879
chapter 13 and 14, you see it very plainly that they would cease, that they

355
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:26,079
would be done away with those temporary sign gifts. But notice in verse number 11

356
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,319
he says, but all these, and so everything that he references beginning in verse

357
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,959
number 8 and following, he says, but all these worketh that one in the self same

358
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:44,959
spirit dividing to every man severally, notice these words, as he will. God has

359
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:51,919
equipped you. God has enabled you. And we think about this subject matter of our

360
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,039
service to God, we think about how great God is, and we've examined it throughout

361
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,559
this year, to think this morning, to comprehend this morning that the God of

362
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,399
the universe would equip us as individuals and enable us to be able to

363
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:12,799
serve him. He's given us the ability. It ought to cause us to rejoice greatly. By

364
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,279
the way, it ought to motivate us to serve him. Amen? We're not to sit on the

365
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,959
premises, we're to stand on the promises. We're not to be on the sidelines, we're

366
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:28,359
to get in the game. Listen, I like playing sports. I'm getting older now, but I enjoy

367
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,759
playing sports. I enjoy playing them a whole lot more than I enjoy watching them. We had

368
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,919
our Labor Day picnic. I haven't played soccer in years. But I got sick and tired of watching

369
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,119
them play soccer. Guess what? I went and played soccer. Right, Fernando? You and I, we're

370
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,519
out there playing soccer. I think I scored four goals. Amen? Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm

371
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,639
getting older. But I had a good time. I wanted to get in the game. I don't want to just watch.

372
00:21:54,639 --> 00:22:04,279
We're talking about serving the Lord. It's a participation thing. It's not just an observation

373
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:11,319
thing. It's not just being a spectator, but being a participator. And he's equipped

374
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,119
us to be able to serve the Lord. And we ought to rejoice for the ability that God has given

375
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,399
us. Notice in the book of Ephesians, in chapter number four, notice with me, in the book

376
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:26,159
of Ephesians, in chapter number four, and I'm going to read a few verses of Scripture

377
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,039
and I hope as we look at this portion that we find here that as Paul is writing to the

378
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,559
church at Ephesus again, how God had equipped them and how God had enabled them, that we

379
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,099
would recognize that it's God who has given us the ability to serve him and we would rejoice

380
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:45,899
greatly because of it. Notice in Ephesians four and verse number seven, but unto every

381
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:51,139
one of us, it's kind of all inclusive, isn't it? No one's left out. If you're saved by

382
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:57,059
grace, you've been enabled to serve the Lord and equipped, is given grace according to

383
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,939
the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he

384
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:08,500
led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Verses nine and 10 is a parenthetical

385
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,579
and it's, I'm not skipping it for the purpose of just avoiding it, but going into the thought

386
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:17,939
of spiritual gifts that God is dealing with in this text of Scripture and you find that

387
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:21,500
he says and gave gifts unto men at the end of verse number eight. He talks about the

388
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,899
measure of the gift of Christ in verse number seven and then notice in verse number 11,

389
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:32,619
and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and

390
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,619
teachers for what purpose? For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,

391
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:41,779
for the edifying of the body of Christ. And we find that it's God who gave, it's God who

392
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:47,059
equipped, it's God who has enabled and when we understand that, we ought to rejoice that

393
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:54,819
he's given us the ability to serve him. Listen, I did not just sign up to be a pastor. I wasn't

394
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,859
at a job fair somewhere and looking at the benefits of what they might be and say, you

395
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:05,419
know, I think that's a really good career path for me. No, God called me. God equipped

396
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:11,979
me. God has enabled me. And by the way, I rejoice for the opportunity. Let me say this,

397
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:17,619
when he was first calling me, I resisted the call. I was scared to death. No, that's not,

398
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:22,100
it's not for me. It's not something, but it was God. I had to realize that as God calls,

399
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,019
God enables and there might be a place of service that God has called you to, that God

400
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,699
has gifted you in a particular area and God will equip you. God will enable you to do

401
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,899
that work. Brother Somerdorst was with us this morning. He didn't just sign up again

402
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:40,979
at the same job fair and I go to the pastor line and he goes to the evangelist line. It's

403
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:47,380
not how it works. God calls and God equips. And what a joy and what a blessing. And you

404
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,940
don't need to turn there, but in 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse number 10, the Bible says, as

405
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,539
every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another as good stewards

406
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:02,259
of the manifold grace of God. We're to be good stewards. It's required in stewards,

407
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,660
the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians, that a man be found faithful. And Peter says in

408
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,139
1 Peter 4 and verse number 10, that we're to be good stewards of the manifold grace

409
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:19,220
of God. That as God has enabled and equipped us, that we're good stewards, that we're faithful

410
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,699
with that which he has entrusted us with. That we recognize that God has given us the

411
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:30,619
ability to serve him. Paul says it this way. I think about the testimony of Paul when I

412
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:35,380
rejoice for this ability to serve the Lord, but I see Paul rejoicing as well to the same

413
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,859
group of people. Notice in 1 Corinthians 15, we were there in chapter 12 just a moment

414
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:45,899
ago, just a few chapters over. Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number

415
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:51,220
10. As the apostle Paul would understand that it was the Lord that equipped him, that gave

416
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,899
him the ability and that Paul had the privilege of serving the Lord and the various ways in

417
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,459
which he had the privilege of serving the Lord. He says this in verse 10 of 1 Corinthians

418
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:10,059
15, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. He says in his grace, which was bestowed upon

419
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:17,019
me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of

420
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:24,019
God which was with me. Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach and so ye

421
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:29,619
believed. Remember there's division in Corinth. I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos and Cephas and

422
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:33,660
so on and so forth and we find that Paul is saying, listen God, I am what I am by the

423
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:40,239
grace of God. God has enabled me and God has equipped me and Paul is rejoicing for the

424
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:45,299
opportunity that he had. He says that I'm laboring, I'm labored more abundantly than

425
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,979
they all. Why? Not because he wanted to be a good steward of the manifold grace of God.

426
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:54,660
God used Peter to pen those words in 1 Peter 4 and verse number 10, but no doubt Paul is

427
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,459
an example of an individual that had been equipped and enabled by God who was a good

428
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:06,660
steward of the manifold grace of God. He says this as he's writing to the folks in Thessalonica.

429
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,979
Notice in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 2, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, notice what

430
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:18,059
Paul says. Again, this ability that we have in rejoicing for the ability to serve the

431
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:24,579
Lord. Again, my attitude as I review my attitude, it's a get to situation, not a have to situation.

432
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,539
Now the bottom line is that really if you were to dig real deep, you really do have

433
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,660
to serve the Lord because you need to be a good, at least you're going to stand before

434
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,899
Christ. You're going to give an account. You're going to give an account. But man, I get to.

435
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:41,579
I get to serve him. I get to serve him. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, notice what Paul

436
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:50,139
says in chapter 2 and verse number 4. He says, but as we were allowed of God to be

437
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:57,459
put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but who? But God, which

438
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:04,000
trieth our hearts. Why? For the audience of one. For the audience of one. Paul says as

439
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,820
he went into Thessalonica and he's preaching the gospel and of course all that was taking

440
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,299
place with regard to the persecution during that particular era of his missionary journey

441
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,100
and we see that his attitude is this. We were allowed of God. I had the privilege. I had

442
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,579
the opportunity. It was a delight. But Paul, you suffered. But Paul, you were persecuted.

443
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:33,739
But I was allowed of God. God entrusted me. God allowed me to do this. But Paul, you suffered.

444
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:39,619
But it was worth it. You read 2 Corinthians chapter number 4. He says it's worth it. It's

445
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:45,380
worth it. And he says here that we were put in trust with the gospel even so we speak

446
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,580
not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. You know what happens when you

447
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,020
try to please men? You fail. You know why you fail? Because it's impossible to please

448
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:06,299
everyone. It is absolutely impossible to please everyone. And if you want a case study

449
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:12,619
on it, you can control the thermostat next week. You say, well that's such a simple thing.

450
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:20,419
You can't please everyone. Promise you. Promise you. But you know, it's for the audience of

451
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:28,059
one when we serve the Lord. For the audience of one. We're serving God and He's the one

452
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:35,020
that tries the heart. By the way, I'm thankful. My heart's deceitful and so is yours. But

453
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:42,179
God, He trieth the heart. He knows. He knows your motive. He knows why you're serving Him.

454
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:47,859
He knows. He knows what your motive is. By the way, if your motive is to be recognized

455
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:52,700
by man, you have your reward. Just go back to Matthew and read what he says about those

456
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,039
Pharisees and those Sadducees. When they prayed those big high prayers and they wanted to

457
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,719
be noticed of men, they have their reward.

458
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:06,399
reward. That's what Jesus says. What's the reward? The applause of man. Did you hear

459
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:14,079
him? No, no, no. It's for the audience of one. And when our motive is to please Christ,

460
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,559
when our motive is to please Christ and to serve Christ and to do it with a pure heart

461
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,319
then he is the one that's exalted and magnified and it's all about him. Will you make people

462
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:30,339
upset? Yeah, you will. But when you keep your focus on I'm serving the Lord, I'm serving

463
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:36,579
the Lord. Paul says it this way in 1 Timothy chapter 1. Think about what Paul says here.

464
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:42,179
It's a verse of scripture that Holly has on her signature of her email and I appreciate

465
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:48,939
this verse of scripture. Many of us have what we might refer to as a life verse. Maybe we

466
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:54,419
sign a card or an email with a particular verse and again Holly has verse 12 of 1 Timothy

467
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:00,139
1. I want you to notice what Paul says in this verse of scripture. And I thank Christ

468
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:10,699
Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the

469
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:21,859
ministry. Notice verse 13 with it. Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious

470
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:27,979
but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. Listen I'm thankful that I'm

471
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:33,659
not what I used to be. In fact they sang about that this morning in that song. I'm a sinner

472
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:38,019
saved by grace and I'm not what I used to be. Aren't you thankful? I'm no longer a servant

473
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,859
of sin, Romans 6 we mentioned that in the beginning of the message. I'm now a servant

474
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:47,659
of righteousness and Paul says this is what I was before but now I have the privilege

475
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:54,699
of serving the Lord and he says I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that

476
00:31:54,699 --> 00:32:01,379
he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry. What a great perspective. Rejoicing

477
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,819
for the ability to serve the Lord. Number three if you're taking notes we must review

478
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:10,659
our attitude, we must rejoice for the ability but number three I want you to recognize what

479
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:17,419
is accomplished when we serve the Lord. Recognize what is accomplished when we serve the Lord.

480
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:22,219
Clearly our service to God is for the audience of one but I would submit to you this morning

481
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:29,939
that it has an impact on many. Our service to God is for the audience of one, the Lord

482
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:37,179
Jesus Christ but it has an impact on many. We read already in 1 Corinthians chapter number

483
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:41,979
12 where the Bible said and we'll look at a couple of verses there in 1 Corinthians

484
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:46,779
chapter 12 notice as we talked about the gifts of the Spirit he said I don't want you to

485
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:52,299
be ignorant concerning the spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 he mentioned in

486
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:58,699
verse number 7 that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with

487
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:06,659
all. And so as the body of Christ is assembled and the people of God are enabled and equipped

488
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:12,159
and we serve the Lord it's yes for God to be glorified but we find that it will have

489
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,739
a profit on all. Notice this truth see the greatest aspect we talk about recognizing

490
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:22,339
what is accomplished when we serve the Lord is that he is glorified. He's glorified.

491
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:27,679
If our service to God is done the way that we've spoken of thus far in the sermon this

492
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,059
morning then God is glorified. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your

493
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,539
good works and do what? Glorify your Father which is in heaven. Is that what the Bible

494
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:44,079
tells us? Those are the words of Jesus and we find that that's the purpose right? Notice

495
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,819
in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we look at verse 18 it says but now hath God set the members

496
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:57,659
every one of them in the body notice as it hath pleased him and for the glory of God.

497
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:04,259
See it's his church and in his church he is to receive glory and when we serve the Lord

498
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:08,059
every single one of us as we serve the Lord in the manner in which God has enabled us

499
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:12,799
to serve the Lord and we're good stewards of the manifold grace of God and we're serving

500
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:19,939
God out of that pure heart in doing what he's called us to do then God is glorified. He's

501
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:25,219
exalted and he's magnified. Look at 1 Peter chapter 4 we referenced verse number 10 earlier

502
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,819
that the Bible talks about being a good steward of the manifold grace of God but I want you

503
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:35,819
to see what the Bible says in verse number 11. In 1 Peter chapter 4 we find that every

504
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:40,339
man hath received the gift and we're thankful for that and we're to be good stewards of

505
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:47,359
the manifold grace of God but verse number 11 of 1 Peter 4 says this if any man speak

506
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,579
let him speak as the oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as of the ability

507
00:34:53,579 --> 00:35:00,159
which God giveth and notice this phrase that God in all things may be glorified through

508
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:07,159
Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever amen. In Ephesians 4 we won't

509
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,839
take the time to turn there but we spoke in that portion of scripture how the Lord gave

510
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:22,219
some to the church. He gave the evangelists, some apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers

511
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:27,699
and he said why for the perfecting of the saints. It's that God would be glorified but

512
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:34,699
number two so that God's people would be edified. What is accomplished when we serve the Lord?

513
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,759
We must recognize what's accomplished when we serve the Lord and by the way all of these

514
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:44,759
things are connected. When I recognize what's accomplished it's going to impact, it's going

515
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,859
to help me have the right attitude. When I understand that it's him that's given me the

516
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:52,319
ability it's going to help me to have the right attitude. When I have the right attitude

517
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,919
then I'm going to serve him the way that I'm supposed to with a pure heart and not for

518
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:59,439
any kind of man accolades and recognition but I'm going to serve the Lord with that

519
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:03,279
pure heart and it's going to accomplish what it's supposed to accomplish. Number one for

520
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:10,379
God to be glorified but number two for God's people to be edified. For the profit of all.

521
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:16,499
That God's people would be edified. That word means to be built up. We find that it's a

522
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:22,319
word the Greek word would often in this particular era be used with regard to the construction

523
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,579
of a building and thinking about the edification and how people are to be built up and we find

524
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,979
that the Bible says for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,

525
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:36,479
for the edifying of the body of Christ in Ephesians 4 and verse number 12 and we find

526
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:41,759
that God's people are to be edified and as we serve again, as we serve God it's for the

527
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:48,399
audience of one but it has an impact on many. It's for the audience of one but it has an

528
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:55,399
impact on many and we have been given the opportunity to serve the Lord. What a privilege.

529
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:02,039
What a privilege as we examine our lives and understanding how great God is and certainly

530
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,899
each of us would say great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. How has his greatness

531
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:13,879
impacted the way that I pray? But this morning how has his greatness impacted how I serve

532
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:20,879
him? Because he's a great God. He's worthy of our best. Amen. He is worthy of our best.

533
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:26,839
I was reading an author a week ago and I was reading a particular author and he was quoting

534
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,359
somebody else and I don't remember who he was quoting so I can't tell you who it was

535
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,339
because it wasn't the man that actually wrote the book that I was reading but he was quoting

536
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:38,679
somebody else and here's what he said. He said you and I have a best part of our day.

537
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,359
What he was talking about is like some people are morning people, some people are evening

538
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,359
people, whatever. We know what the best part of our day is. He said you know what I try

539
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,879
to do in my life? I try to give God the best part of my day. The best. Why? Because he

540
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:58,319
deserves it. You go over and read the book of Malachi. What a convicting book. They're

541
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,319
bringing some offerings but God says no, no, no would you take that to your governor? No

542
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:09,219
you wouldn't. So why are you bringing it to me? I'm a great God and he is. Listen I know

543
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:13,399
we've joked and I've said it before about that phraseology of it's good enough for government

544
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:21,559
work. Listen it's not good. Our best is what God deserves. By the way aren't you thankful

545
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:29,839
that he gave you his best? I don't want to just mail it in. I don't want to just kind

546
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:37,359
of go through the motions. No, no he deserves my best. He deserves your best. Let me use

547
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,199
an example in closing this morning. An example from the Old Testament. Turn back to the book

548
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,719
of Exodus if you will. We won't take time to look through all of it. In fact it would

549
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,159
be a sermon series to look at all of it. But I want you to look at Exodus 36 and we're

550
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,839
going to kind of walk our way through a few verses of scripture throughout the end of

551
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,039
the book of Exodus here this morning in closing. With this idea of our service to God for the

552
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,919
audience of one. As we examine our lives and we begin to consider how is my service to

553
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:14,879
God? What am I doing for God? How am I serving God? I hope that you have an answer for that

554
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:20,519
question because God has equipped you. He's enabled you. He's given us the opportunity,

555
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,599
the ability to serve him. What a privilege it is. We find that in the book of Exodus

556
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,599
there's a lot of things that are taking place in the book of Exodus. Of course God is bringing

557
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,279
his people out of Egyptian captivity, Egyptian bondage and as God would bring his people

558
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:40,079
out we find that God gives them instruction. He takes Moses up and gives them the Ten Commandments

559
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,479
and so on and so forth and the law. He provides for them. The people break even the law as

560
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:50,079
he's up there and receiving instruction with regard to the construction of the tabernacle.

561
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,919
And many of us would be familiar with the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The gathering

562
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:58,919
place, the meeting place, the worshipping place if you will for the children of Israel

563
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,719
until the time of...

564
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:07,599
Solomon when the temple would be built. So, for a number of generations, it was that God's

565
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,639
presence was known physically on earth through the tabernacle. We find that the Bible tells us,

566
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:22,559
and what a joy, in the book of John, that Jesus, he dwelt among us, and that Greek word truly is

567
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,919
tabernacled amongst us. What a privilege and what a blessing. You think about the incarnation.

568
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:32,959
But here, we think about the construction of the tabernacle. All of the instruction is given.

569
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:37,519
If you were to study the book of Exodus, and if you were to have an idea of the tabernacle,

570
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,999
and all of the intricacies. I mean, it was a very elaborate structure. There was a lot of work that

571
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:48,879
took place. But I want you to understand that if you were to study through the book of Exodus,

572
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:54,639
and begin to try to nail down a time frame, it's about five to six months that it took

573
00:40:54,639 --> 00:41:00,959
them to construct the tabernacle. Now, that's pretty amazing. When you consider all that was

574
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,439
involved with the tabernacle, and all of the pieces of furniture, and the elaborate work,

575
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:10,479
five to six months for its completion. And we think about this truth as we look at this idea

576
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:14,639
of our service to the Lord. And as we think about the construction of the tabernacle,

577
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,239
God had equipped Bezalel and Aholiab. He gives us their names specifically. And by the way,

578
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,079
he told Moses about them, not only equipping them for the work, but enabling them to teach others

579
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:31,839
how to do those things. But we find that as we look here, and we think about their work for God,

580
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
the Bible tells us in Exodus 36, in verse number one, notice it says,

581
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,559
then wrought Bezalel and Aholiab, notice, and every wise-hearted man. And then notice this phrase,

582
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:49,599
in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work

583
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,999
for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the Lord had commanded. So,

584
00:41:55,999 --> 00:42:01,599
who was it that equipped them? It was the Lord. Who was it that equips you? It's the Lord.

585
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,959
We've belabored the point in the New Testament this morning, for us as God's people in 2023,

586
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:12,959
that God has equipped and enabled us. And here, as we look at this Old Testament illustration

587
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:18,879
to prove the point this morning, to nail it home, if you will, that it was God who had given

588
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:25,599
to Bezalel, Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, the Lord put wisdom and understanding

589
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,799
to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all the

590
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:35,679
Lord had commanded. Notice verse two, and Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab and every wise-hearted

591
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,279
man, in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, and every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto

592
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:49,919
the work. Notice these words, to do it. What a privilege. I don't know. God doesn't tell us a

593
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:58,319
whole lot about Bezalel or Aholiab. The other men aren't even name by name. But I'd like to think

594
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:07,759
that these men had a perspective of who am I that God would allow me to be used in this manner.

595
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:15,919
Who am I that I would be privileged, that God would enable me to make these pieces of furniture

596
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:23,759
that would be within the holy place and even the holy of holies. It's amazing. And they were

597
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:29,519
equipped, but they had to do the work. They were equipped for it, but they had to do it.

598
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,679
We've been equipped, we've been enabled, we've been given a gift, but we better use it.

599
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:43,359
We better use it. And we find in chapter 36 that God tells us how they were to do the work and how

600
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,759
the people brought the materials that were needed. And you read through chapter 36 and 37 and 38 and

601
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:54,639
you find that throughout these chapters that they're working and they're working diligently.

602
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,999
They're working. It seems as if as you read the chapters here in the book of Exodus that it's a

603
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:04,879
delight for them. You don't see Moses having to run around and try to, hey, let's go guys, we got

604
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:10,399
to get this done. Let's go. No, no, it looks like it's a delight. It's just joy. We sing the song,

605
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:16,959
there's joy in serving Jesus. And here they're serving the Lord. And you come to chapter 39

606
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:23,599
of the book of Exodus and look down, if you will, at verse number 32. The Bible says,

607
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,639
I'll give you a moment, 39 and verse 32,

608
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:33,519
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, look at that word,

609
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:41,359
finished. It was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,

610
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:49,039
so did they. They were faithful. Notice what it said, it was finished. They did the work that

611
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:53,759
they did the work that God called them to do. Notice what it says, according to all that the

612
00:44:53,759 --> 00:45:01,199
Lord commanded Moses, so did they. No shortcuts. They did it all. Notice in verse number 42,

613
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,719
the end of the chapter, Exodus 39 verse 42, according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,

614
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:13,679
so the children of Israel made all the work. And Moses did look upon all the work and behold,

615
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:21,599
they had done it as the Lord had commanded. Even so had they done it and Moses blessed them.

616
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:29,759
Wow. What an amazing time in Israel's history. Chapter 40 of the book of Exodus,

617
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:35,279
one of my favorite chapters of the Bible, because you see what takes place with the

618
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:39,839
rearing up of the tabernacle. We don't have time to read through it, but you'll notice if you read

619
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,599
it later on your own, that you'll find a number of references. In fact, 13 times from verse three

620
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:52,319
down through verse number 15, you read this statement, and thou shout. God told them what to

621
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,239
do. God explicitly explained to them the instruction that they're to follow. And then you find that the

622
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,079
Bible tells us as the Lord commanded Moses, repeated seven times, and you find that they

623
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,399
did it. They did the work. They did what God called them to do. And you come to verse number 34.

624
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,039
And in Exodus chapter 40 and verse number 34, it starts with a word then.

625
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:24,079
Then. The word then is an interesting word because it means after something. After the Lord commanded

626
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:30,719
and after they did according to what the Lord commanded then. Then does not come

627
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:39,839
if they don't do. Would you agree? We never read the end of Exodus 40 if they don't do as the Lord

628
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,519
commanded them to do. What is accomplished? What is it when we think about this truth of serving

629
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,919
the Lord and we recognize what is accomplished when we serve the Lord? We've already noted

630
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:54,879
their attitude. We've understood that God's given them the ability and we find what is accomplished.

631
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:59,519
Well, because they did the work, we're able to read the end of Exodus when the Bible says,

632
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:11,759
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

633
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:18,159
Verse 35, and Moses were not able to enter into the tent of the congregation. Why? Because the

634
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:24,399
cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. I hope that you'd agree

635
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:30,799
with me this morning that here we would find that God is glorified. There's no, listen, there's no

636
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:34,959
way that God would fill the tabernacle with his glory if he wasn't pleased with what they did.

637
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,919
And we find here that God's glory is manifested. His glory fills the tabernacle according to verse

638
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:48,159
34 and verse number 35 and the Lord is exalted. The Lord is glorified. That's what happens in

639
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,639
your life and in my life when we serve the Lord. Listen, God's not called any one of us to build a

640
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,639
tabernacle. God's not called, he is, I'm thankful that my body is, when I got saved, when you got

641
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,439
saved, our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Amen? That's what the New Testament believers,

642
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:09,199
we understand that. You don't have to, God's not called you to do what he called a bezel on a holy

643
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,999
abbey and these wise-hearted men, but we find that as they did what God called them to do,

644
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:18,319
as they reviewed, they had the right attitude, they understood the ability that God gave,

645
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,879
and they accomplished bringing glory to God. That's the first and primary reason that we serve

646
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:29,519
God is to bring honor and glory to him. But I said this is for the audience of one but has an impact

647
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:38,000
on many. I want you to understand that for generations, for generations, the people of Israel

648
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:44,559
went to a tabernacle and brought their offerings, pointing to Messiah who would one day come

649
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:52,399
because some people served the Lord. There's no record, none that I have found, if you found it,

650
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:56,799
please help me, none that I have found where any of these pieces of furniture are ever remade

651
00:48:57,759 --> 00:49:04,799
before the construction of the temple. They did a thorough work. They were diligent in serving

652
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:12,559
the Lord and generations of people were impacted because of their service to God. It was for the

653
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:17,759
glory of God, but it had an impact on many. And I wonder this morning,

654
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,599
does our service bring glory to God? How are we serving God? Is it bringing glory to him?

655
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:33,359
Who's it impacting? How is our service having an effect on others? What a joy to have the

656
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,479
opportunity to serve the Lord. I think of some Bible characters that served the Lord and had

657
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:44,239
a proper perspective and they understood what God had given them to do. And I think about the

658
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:50,319
way in which David prepared for the house of the Lord, the temple, if you fast forward all of these

659
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:56,639
generations later and you think about what God is doing and how David would prepare for the palace

660
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,679
and he says that the palace is not for man but it's for God.

661
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:01,279
So therefore, what was David doing?

662
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:05,399
Man, David was preparing with all of his might, the Bible tells us.

663
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:12,439
He talks about how the house that God would dwell in, that Solomon would build, how that

664
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:17,639
it was to be a great house and how it was to be magnificent and so on and so forth.

665
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,639
And we find here that God would use David in this way.

666
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:27,879
I think about the situation as you look at the, after the destruction of Jerusalem and

667
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:33,799
the Babylonian captivity and all that takes place and you begin to think about the rebuilding

668
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,839
and what takes place and those opposition and how that the Bible tells us that there

669
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,239
were some people that had the opportunity to go and to do a work and here the people

670
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:49,099
were calling, hey, come down here and let's talk and let's do this and what have you and

671
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:55,759
all of those that were trying to prevent the work of God from continuing to go forward.

672
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:59,719
And we find that the perspective was that we're doing a great work.

673
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:00,719
Why?

674
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:01,719
Because it's a work for God.

675
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:04,059
It's a work for God.

676
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:07,999
This morning as we serve the Lord, we're not serving men.

677
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:11,799
As you serve in our church, you're not serving me as the pastor.

678
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:14,319
You're serving the Lord.

679
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,919
Does it profit with all?

680
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:16,919
Sure it does.

681
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:18,999
Does it have an impact on the whole body?

682
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:19,999
Sure.

683
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:23,999
That's how it's supposed to work ultimately to bring honor and glory to the Lord.

684
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:28,239
And as we bring honor and glory to the Lord, then we have the opportunity to also have

685
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:29,999
an impact on many.

686
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:36,519
This morning for the audience of one, we serve a great God, a great, great God and He gives

687
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,679
us the opportunity, the privilege of being able to serve Him.

688
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,119
I wonder this morning, how's our attitude towards serving the Lord?

689
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:46,079
How's our attitude?

690
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,719
Do we have the perspective that I have to do this or do we have the perspective that

691
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:51,919
I get to do this?

692
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:57,519
I hope this morning it's a get to perspective, that it's a delight, that there truly is joy

693
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,719
in serving Jesus.

694
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,899
Recognize this morning it's God who's given us the ability.

695
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:06,079
We must remember that.

696
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,479
The only thing special about us is God.

697
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:12,679
It's the only thing special about us.

698
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:16,559
Paul said, I am what I am by the grace of God.

699
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:23,439
This morning we can accomplish great things as we serve the Lord, glorifying Him and then

700
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:25,719
impacting others.

701
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:30,359
This morning for the audience of one, O Lord, would our service be pleasing to Thee?

702
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,279
Would we have that right perspective?

703
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:33,279
Let's pray.

704
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:34,279
Father, we love You.

705
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,359
How we thank You for loving us.

706
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:42,199
We thank You for the opportunity that You've given us to gather, to hear from Your Word.

707
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:48,879
Thank You for the examples of those in the Scriptures that served You faithfully.

708
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:55,239
God I pray that You would help us to serve You faithfully and acceptably.

709
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:00,399
Lord that we would evaluate our lives, our attitude toward our service to You.

710
00:53:00,399 --> 00:53:04,359
God I pray that we bring You honor and glory.

711
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:08,799
I pray that others would be impacted by our service to Thee.

712
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,799
Lord maybe there's someone here that's not sure of heaven.

713
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:14,359
They've never been saved.

714
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,959
God I pray that today they'd be saved.

715
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,519
They'd trust Christ as their Savior.

716
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,519
You're understanding they could never work to get to heaven.

717
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,359
They could never work to keep themselves saved.

718
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:31,879
Yes, the Bible speaks of our works, our service, it's a result of being saved, not the means

719
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,439
by which we are saved.

720
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:38,079
God I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict that one that might be here, Lord,

721
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,399
that they would understand their need today to be saved.

722
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:45,039
I pray for every child of God, Lord, as we've gathered this morning, we've been challenged

723
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,439
by Your Word.

724
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:51,359
I pray that we would evaluate our lives and our service to You.

725
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,719
God I pray that You'd help us to do what You've called us to do.

726
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:59,839
That we would be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

727
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,739
That You would use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

728
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:07,359
That many others would be impacted by our service.

729
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,639
We'll thank You in these moments of invitation, Lord, for the work that You'll do.

730
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:16,320
I pray that You'd have Your will and way in every individual that's gathered together.

731
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,320
We'll thank You for it.

732
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,320
In Christ's name we pray.

733
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
Would you stand with me?

734
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

735
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,959
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she plays the altar is open.

736
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:29,839
Maybe this morning you want to come and thank God for the opportunity to serve.

737
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,279
Maybe this morning you've not been serving like you should be and maybe you want to come

738
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:38,279
and ask God to help you in that particular area of your life.

739
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:41,559
If you're not saved we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that

740
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:44,119
heaven's your home as Kimberly plays the altar is open.
