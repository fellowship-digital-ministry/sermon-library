WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579
And this morning, we're gonna deal with our service

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:04.420
to the Lord.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.119
I've titled the message for the audience of one,

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:08.420
for the audience of one.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.079
And I hope that as we go through the message this morning,

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.520
that that title will be abundantly clear to you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.700
as what I'm seeking to communicate through this message

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.639
for the audience of one.

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:20.760
For the last three weeks,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
we had the opportunity minus last Sunday,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.520
but as we've dealt with this third phase, if you will,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.180
for our annual theme,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.940
the great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.500
We discovered his greatness.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.299
We spoke about the importance of declaring his greatness.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:36.680
And then for this third phase,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.540
we've dealt with the subject of how God's greatness

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.459
will impact our lives.

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.459
And I believe that when we understand how great he is,

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:47.500
it should have an impact on each of us.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.979
For indeed it is true that what we believe

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.139
will impact our behavior.

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.000
For three weeks,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.220
we spent time looking at the subject matter of prayer.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.099
And there were several times that we noted

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.419
that what we believe to be true about God,

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:02.860
and we find that in his precious word

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.019
will impact how we pray.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.580
We pray that God will move mountains because he can,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.019
because he's God, because he has all power,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:11.839
because he's reigning and ruling.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:14.620
We pray that God would save sinners because he's able.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.540
And you think about the way that we pray,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.900
it's based upon what we believe to be true

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.360
about God's word, about who God is.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.180
We find that we've looked at David,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.059
the life of David in Psalm 32.

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:27.720
We look at the life of Daniel.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.519
Why did Daniel have such confidence in praying

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.660
that God would show him not only the dream,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.760
but the interpretation of the dream,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.300
because he knew who God was.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.559
He knew who God was.

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:42.360
And therefore he prayed that God would give an answer.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760
And guess what God did.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.279
And Daniel did not stand before Nebuchadnezzar

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.400
and say that I'm able.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.239
He said, there's a God in heaven and praise the Lord.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.080
He's still there.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.019
He rules and he reigns and he's able.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.339
We had the opportunity to look at the life of Paul.

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:57.379
And we dealt with the subject matter of a life

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:58.980
marked by prayer.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.220
And we looked at his life.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.739
And as we were challenged through those messages

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.620
to examine our own prayer lives,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.500
and in order to determine how our prayer lives

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.139
have been shaped, have been impacted

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.139
by what God has given to us in his word

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.220
about how great he is.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.940
What is it that's on your prayer list?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820
What is it that we're praying about right now

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.899
that only God can do?

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.220
And that really will impact as we examine these things,

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.899
how we pray.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.460
This morning, I'd like to move into a second thought

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.460
and that would be our service to God.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.179
You know, it's a privilege to serve God.

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.059
And I would say this morning that when I truly understand

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:42.179
how great our God is, it should impact how I serve him.

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.139
I'm not just serving a mere human.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm not just serving some false idol.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.720
No, I'm serving the great I am.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.979
I'm serving the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.699
And as we consider that thought this morning

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.860
and understanding that as we serve God,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.539
we must never lose sight of the fact

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.300
that we are serving God.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.539
Yes, will our service be to people?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.740
No doubt.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.740
But ultimately, our service is for the audience of one.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.460
It's for God.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.179
What a privilege it is to serve the Lord.

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.539
Notice in Ephesians chapter two,

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.139
we're familiar with verses eight and nine.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.500
I'll read them together with verse number 10.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.179
The Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.139
And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.059
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.619
Notice verse 10, for we are his workmanship,

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.419
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.419
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.380
So we're gonna think about this truth

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380
of our service to the Lord.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.880
I want you to consider just a few thoughts

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.720
with me this morning.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.240
Number one, we should review our attitude

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.720
towards serving the Lord.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.160
We should review our attitude towards serving the Lord.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.520
In other words, we understand, the Bible says here,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.240
we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.919
notice, unto good works, which God hath before ordained

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.720
that we should walk in them.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720
Before salvation, before you trust

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.679
that Christ is your Savior,

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.720
before I trust that Christ is my Savior,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.359
if you're here this morning and you've not yet been saved,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.320
according to the Bible in Romans six and verse number 17,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.040
I was a servant of sin, but in Christ.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:26.720
According to Romans 6, 18,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.359
no longer am I a servant of sin,

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:31.559
but now I serve the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.640
and I am a servant of righteousness.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.559
And you know, the reality is I'd much rather

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.799
be a servant of righteousness than a servant of sin.

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:42.720
And we find that truth to be there for us

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.920
in Romans six, verse 17 and 18.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.959
But when we understand this truth about serving the Lord

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.119
and reviewing our attitude towards our service,

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.559
I wonder this morning, do we have the perspective

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.720
that I have to serve the Lord,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.359
or do we have the perspective that I get to serve the Lord?

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.920
There's a great difference between having that perspective

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.000
that I have to do this,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.959
and sometimes when we take that perspective,

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:10.619
it becomes overbearing, it becomes duty,

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.600
it's just difficult and maybe with drudgery,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.079
but when we have the perspective,

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:17.260
when we review our attitude and understand

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.179
that we are his workmanship,

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.220
that God has created us for this,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.899
that he has designed it to be so,

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.700
then I say, I get to serve the Lord.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.899
I get to serve Christ.

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:31.380
What a privilege, what a blessing.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.820
We find this morning that the Bible is abundantly clear.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.260
When we think about this truth of our service to God,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.940
we do not serve the Lord to get saved.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.779
Ephesians two and eight in verse eight and nine

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.339
are quite clear that the Bible says,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.420
for by grace are you saved through faith,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.380
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.040
not of works, lest any man should be saved,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.140
lest any man should boast,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.299
and so we think about Ephesians two, verses eight and nine,

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:03.619
we understand the Bible is abundantly clear

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.579
when we speak about our service to God.

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:08.279
It's not so that you can be saved.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.579
It's not even that you could stay saved.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.220
See, you can't serve God to stay saved

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.660
just like you can't serve God to get saved.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.399
The Bible tells us in 1 Peter one, verses four and five,

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.839
that we are kept by the power of God.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.500
We find that we have an inheritance

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.859
that's reserved in heaven for us.

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:29.459
I cannot work to be saved, nor can I work to stay saved,

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:31.660
but when we understand and we examine,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.239
we review our attitude towards serving the Lord,

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:38.100
we understand this morning that we get to serve God

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.579
because we are saved.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:42.540
It's the result of being saved

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.100
that gives us the privilege and the opportunity

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.059
to serve the master, to serve the king of kings

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.859
and Lord of lords, and what a great privilege it is.

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:52.220
But at times, if we're not careful,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.220
our attitude can kind of get sideways

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.760
with regard to service.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.579
We can kind of get into the drudgery

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:58.940
and the monotony, if you will,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.619
and we can get overwhelmed with it,

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.540
and we lose our focus that we're serving the Lord,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.579
we're serving the master, and what a blessing.

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:10.359
Think about the perspective, if you will,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.679
of the psalmist, or Psalm 84,

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:14.619
and I want you to look at a couple of verses

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.839
within the Psalms, because really,

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.839
I hope this morning that your service for Christ

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:23.179
is a delight, that it's a delight.

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:25.420
We understand that God has designed it

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.679
that his children would serve him,

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:30.320
and what a blessing it is, and you say,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.279
as we look at this truth of serving the Lord,

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.640
we understand that it comes,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.799
and we'll look at our next point,

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:39.160
it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.839
and everyone's service is not the same,

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.880
but what a privilege it is to serve the Lord,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.040
and it should be a delight.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.040
In Psalm 84, notice in verse number 10,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.440
the Bible says, for a day in thy court

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.679
is better than a thousand.

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:57.500
I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.519
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.239
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:07.720
The psalmist says that they'd rather be a doorkeeper

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.720
in the house of my God, a doorkeeper.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.679
You say, well, that's kind of a,

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:17.260
no, no, no, that's a service to the king.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.760
It's a privilege, it's a delight

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.160
to be able to serve the Lord,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.320
and you think about the perspective here.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.019
It says I'd rather do that

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:26.299
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:28.440
I want you to think about your service to the Lord,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.079
and the reality is that, listen,

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.640
I'd rather clean bathrooms for the Lord

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.400
than do something else for the world, amen,

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.760
and what a delight.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.359
Somebody came to me not long ago and said,

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:40.679
pastor, what can I do?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.080
I'll clean toilets, I'll clean this, I'll do that,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.320
whatever, I just wanna serve the Lord,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.559
and praise the Lord for that kind of perspective

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:53.440
because why, it's a privilege to serve God.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.799
It is an absolute privilege.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.039
The psalmist says here in Psalm 84,

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.020
what he would rather do,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.760
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.159
I want you to think about Psalm 100,

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.960
and of course, we're familiar with that psalm.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.840
It's a very familiar psalm to us,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.440
but I want you to see what the psalmist says

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.479
in Psalm 100 in verse number two.

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:13.099
The Bible says this, serve the Lord how?

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:15.919
With gladness, with gladness.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.640
Come before his presence with singing,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.520
and we think about this truth

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.359
as we review our attitude towards serving the Lord.

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:25.479
I get to do this, I get to serve God.

00:09:25.479 --> 00:09:28.239
I can do it with gladness, and why?

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:31.760
Because my perspective is that it's for the audience of one,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.739
for the audience of one.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm serving the Lord.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.599
I have the privilege of being able to serve Christ.

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:39.119
You say, well, as the pastor, you get to,

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:41.440
no, no, listen, we get to serve Christ.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.859
There were many a day after I trusted Christ as my savior,

00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:46.320
I was an usher at our church,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.200
the first church I ever went to after I got saved,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.520
and I was an usher at that church as a teenager,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440
and you know what the job of the ushers were?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.159
All the ushers are gonna get scared this morning.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.320
The job of the ushers every Saturday morning

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.159
was to go to the church house and clean the house,

00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:00.760
the church house, and we went to that church house.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.000
church house, all the ushers, we get together on Saturday morning early before visitation and we'd

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.560
get there and we'd spend a couple of hours before visitation cleaning that church house. Then we go

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.520
on visitation, we come back after visitation and we clean the church house some more. And you know

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.520
it was a delight. It was just a joy to be able to serve the Lord. And at times we must review

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.120
our attitude towards serving the Lord because we don't want to get bogged down in the work.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.600
We don't want to get overwhelmed. We don't want to look at the wrong thing. We want to remind

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.280
ourselves that we're serving the Lord, that it's for the audience of one. I don't have to,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:41.240
but I get to. It's a great perspective in life. Number two, we must rejoice for the ability to

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.880
serve the Lord. Rejoice for the ability to serve the Lord. You know it's God who has gifted each

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.880
of his children and given us the ability to serve him. And as I begin to think about that truth

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.400
and we understand this morning that we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus notice unto

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.680
good works. And then at the end of verse number 10 of Ephesians 2 it says, which God hath before

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:11.800
ordained that we should walk in them. And this is great for us to rejoice in having the ability

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:19.480
to serve the Lord. So I can't do what I used to do. God knows that. There's a great Bible

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.320
character that we're familiar with. We won't take the time to go to the book of Joshua,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.240
but you understand in the life of Joshua that there comes a time in Joshua's life,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.880
he was the human leader for the nation of Israel. He's the one that leads the children of Israel

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.080
into the land of promise. He's the one that leads the children of Israel into all the battles that

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.560
we read in the beginning of the book of Joshua and all of that. But there comes a time when God

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:50.120
says to Joshua, you're old. You're old. He no longer was going to go out and lead in battles,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.960
but what was he going to do? He's going to divide the land. That was his duty. That was

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.160
his responsibility. And guess what we find about Joshua? He was faithful to lead the children of

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:08.520
Israel into battle, but as his life stages changed, he was faithful to serve God in dividing the land.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.960
If you're to study the book of Joshua, the latter part of the book, you'll find that there's some

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.080
children, some tribes of the nation of Israel that kind of just sat around and they didn't do

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.760
anything. And Joshua said, hey, what's going on? Aren't you going to go and claim your land,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:26.760
claim your inheritance? And he was used of God. And then he challenges the people before his death

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.040
on serving the Lord. There are different stages that you see in the life of Joshua

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.680
through that book of Joshua. And you find that all along the way, he's serving the Lord. Is it

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:45.240
in different ways? Absolutely. But he's still serving God. And he had the ability to do what

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.880
God called him to do at that time. Why? Because God equipped him and God enabled him for the task

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.360
that was at hand. God equipped him and God enabled him for the battles that took place in the

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.320
beginning of the book of Joshua. But then God enabled and equipped him for the division of the

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.120
land that you read of in the midst of the book of Joshua. And then God equipped and enabled him to

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.400
deliver those challenging messages to the two and a half tribes and to the leaders and the people

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:20.200
of Israel before he would die. God enabled him. God equipped him. And God equips and enables each

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.040
of us. Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will. And I want to go through a few verses here

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.480
in the book of 1 Corinthians. And it's interesting as we look at this particular book, the church in

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.200
Corinth, as we understand, turn to chapter number one to begin. But the church of Corinth is not a

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.120
model church. The church in Corinth has lots of problems. The church in Corinth is being corrected

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:46.360
for a lot of things that they're doing wrong. And the Lord would use the apostle Paul to pen

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.280
this book in order to give them instruction with regard to how they were to serve the Lord and what

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.720
was to take place. But when we understand and we're rejoicing for the ability to serve the Lord,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.400
I want you to see what God says to the people at Corinth with regard to their service. In verse

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.680
number four of 1 Corinthians 1, notice what Paul says to these believers under the inspiration of

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.760
the Holy Spirit of God. He says, I thank my God always on your behalf. Notice this, for the grace

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:22.680
of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. I would submit to you this morning that that grace of God

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.960
which is given you by Jesus Christ is not only saving grace, though it encompasses that, but it's

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.800
also serving grace and the ability to serve the Lord. Paul talks about the grace that was bestowed

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:40.119
upon him. At the end of this book, we find that Peter mentions about being a

00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:45.720
good steward of the manifold grace of God. And we find here that he's speaking about, notice, the

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.440
grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. That in everything, verse number five, ye are

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.440
enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.720
confirmed in you. Notice verse seven, so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.000
our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, as you study the book of 1 Corinthians, you find that one of the reasons

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.040
that there's some division and some jealousy and envy within the members of the church at Corinth

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.800
is because of the subject of spiritual gifts. Some were saying, well, I have this gift and you

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.559
have that gift and my gift is better than your gift and so on and so forth. And we'll look at a

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:32.200
few verses because the apostle Paul is going to deal with that and try to help them. But I want

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.240
you to notice as we speak about the ability to serve God and how we ought to rejoice that he's

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.160
given us the ability to serve the Lord, that it is God who has given us the grace. It is God who has

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.600
given us the ability. He has equipped us. And it says here of the church in Corinth that they come

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.720
behind in no gift. This church that was full of division and envy was a church that was gifted

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:01.720
spiritually. But they allowed those spiritual gifts to cause them to look at each other and say,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.000
I'm better than you because of the gift that I have. And they totally missed the purpose for which

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.720
God gave them the spiritual gifts in the first place. Notice in chapter number 4 of 1 Corinthians

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:21.080
verses 6 and 7, notice what the Bible says here. In chapter 4, 1 Corinthians 4 verse 6 and 7,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.440
the Bible says this, and these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.480
Apollos for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.040
that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. He's dealing with the importance of

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.160
humility. And notice in verse 7 he says, for who maketh thee to differ from another? By the way,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:48.119
aren't you happy everyone's not like you? Amen. I'm happy everyone's not like me. I'm happy

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:54.040
everyone's not like you. I'm happy I'm not like you. Amen. But the reality is God's made us

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.640
different. But then notice when we think about the spiritual gifts, notice in verse number 7,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:03.800
and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? He's going to build upon this as we go through

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.279
the book of 1 Corinthians, and we'll look at a few more verses. He says, now if thou didst receive

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:14.279
it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it? And we find that he's speaking,

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:18.360
we look at this idea of the ability to serve the Lord, and we rejoice that God's given us

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:25.000
the ability. Why? Because it's God who has equipped us. It is God who has enabled us.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.600
Think about this, the God of the universe, the one who spoke it all into existence,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.520
the one who formed man from the dust of the ground and then breathed the life into them

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:45.080
through the breath of God, that he would allow us, he would allow you to serve him. It's amazing

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:52.360
that he would allow us to serve him in any capacity. It's amazing the ability that he's

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:59.160
given us to serve him. In 1 Corinthians chapter 12, notice as he continues to help this group

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:05.400
of believers in Corinth to understand the subject matter of spiritual gifts and to understand

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.559
the ability that God had given them to be able to serve the Lord. Remember, we don't serve God,

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:16.600
we don't do good works to be saved, we don't serve the Lord or do good works to stay saved,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:24.040
but because we are saved, we are to serve Christ. We are to do good works. Notice in 1 Corinthians 12,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.520
now, verse number one, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.000
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.679
Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus a

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:48.760
curse, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:55.000
diversities of gifts, but notice this, the same Spirit. Verse number five, and there are differences

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.200
of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:10.119
God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:17.559
with all. Every man has been equipped and enabled to be able to serve Christ. Every child of God.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:22.440
Remember the book of 1 Corinthians has been written to save people, to people that have been

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.119
born again, saved by the grace of God. And he says that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:35.559
every man to profit with all. For to one, notice verse eight, is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.840
To another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit. To another, faith by the same Spirit. To

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.559
another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit. To another, the working of miracles. To another, prophecy.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.320
To another, discerning of spirits. To another, diverse kinds of tongues. To another, the

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.400
interpretation of tongues. Now I'm not going to get into all the spiritual gifts this morning,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.320
but understand that some of those were temporary sign gifts. The gift of healing, the gift of

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.679
tongues, those are temporary.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:05.919
sign gifts. We think about even the gift of prophecy with regard to

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:10.399
foretelling versus what we would look at it today as being

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:14.479
foretelling. We see that those things have ceased. In fact, as you read through

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:19.879
chapter 13 and 14, you see it very plainly that they would cease, that they

00:20:19.879 --> 00:20:26.079
would be done away with those temporary sign gifts. But notice in verse number 11

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:30.319
he says, but all these, and so everything that he references beginning in verse

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:35.959
number 8 and following, he says, but all these worketh that one in the self same

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:44.959
spirit dividing to every man severally, notice these words, as he will. God has

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:51.919
equipped you. God has enabled you. And we think about this subject matter of our

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:56.039
service to God, we think about how great God is, and we've examined it throughout

00:20:56.039 --> 00:21:01.559
this year, to think this morning, to comprehend this morning that the God of

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:06.399
the universe would equip us as individuals and enable us to be able to

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:12.799
serve him. He's given us the ability. It ought to cause us to rejoice greatly. By

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:19.279
the way, it ought to motivate us to serve him. Amen? We're not to sit on the

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:23.959
premises, we're to stand on the promises. We're not to be on the sidelines, we're

00:21:23.959 --> 00:21:28.359
to get in the game. Listen, I like playing sports. I'm getting older now, but I enjoy

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:33.759
playing sports. I enjoy playing them a whole lot more than I enjoy watching them. We had

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:37.919
our Labor Day picnic. I haven't played soccer in years. But I got sick and tired of watching

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:42.119
them play soccer. Guess what? I went and played soccer. Right, Fernando? You and I, we're

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:48.519
out there playing soccer. I think I scored four goals. Amen? Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:54.639
getting older. But I had a good time. I wanted to get in the game. I don't want to just watch.

00:21:54.639 --> 00:22:04.279
We're talking about serving the Lord. It's a participation thing. It's not just an observation

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:11.319
thing. It's not just being a spectator, but being a participator. And he's equipped

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:16.119
us to be able to serve the Lord. And we ought to rejoice for the ability that God has given

00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:20.399
us. Notice in the book of Ephesians, in chapter number four, notice with me, in the book

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:26.159
of Ephesians, in chapter number four, and I'm going to read a few verses of Scripture

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:31.039
and I hope as we look at this portion that we find here that as Paul is writing to the

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:36.559
church at Ephesus again, how God had equipped them and how God had enabled them, that we

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:41.099
would recognize that it's God who has given us the ability to serve him and we would rejoice

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:45.899
greatly because of it. Notice in Ephesians four and verse number seven, but unto every

00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:51.139
one of us, it's kind of all inclusive, isn't it? No one's left out. If you're saved by

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:57.059
grace, you've been enabled to serve the Lord and equipped, is given grace according to

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:01.939
the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he

00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:08.500
led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Verses nine and 10 is a parenthetical

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.579
and it's, I'm not skipping it for the purpose of just avoiding it, but going into the thought

00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:17.939
of spiritual gifts that God is dealing with in this text of Scripture and you find that

00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:21.500
he says and gave gifts unto men at the end of verse number eight. He talks about the

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.899
measure of the gift of Christ in verse number seven and then notice in verse number 11,

00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:32.619
and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:36.619
teachers for what purpose? For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:41.779
for the edifying of the body of Christ. And we find that it's God who gave, it's God who

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:47.059
equipped, it's God who has enabled and when we understand that, we ought to rejoice that

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:54.819
he's given us the ability to serve him. Listen, I did not just sign up to be a pastor. I wasn't

00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:58.859
at a job fair somewhere and looking at the benefits of what they might be and say, you

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:05.419
know, I think that's a really good career path for me. No, God called me. God equipped

00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:11.979
me. God has enabled me. And by the way, I rejoice for the opportunity. Let me say this,

00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:17.619
when he was first calling me, I resisted the call. I was scared to death. No, that's not,

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:22.100
it's not for me. It's not something, but it was God. I had to realize that as God calls,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:28.019
God enables and there might be a place of service that God has called you to, that God

00:24:28.019 --> 00:24:33.699
has gifted you in a particular area and God will equip you. God will enable you to do

00:24:33.699 --> 00:24:36.899
that work. Brother Somerdorst was with us this morning. He didn't just sign up again

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:40.979
at the same job fair and I go to the pastor line and he goes to the evangelist line. It's

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:47.380
not how it works. God calls and God equips. And what a joy and what a blessing. And you

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.940
don't need to turn there, but in 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse number 10, the Bible says, as

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.539
every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another as good stewards

00:24:56.539 --> 00:25:02.259
of the manifold grace of God. We're to be good stewards. It's required in stewards,

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:07.660
the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians, that a man be found faithful. And Peter says in

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.139
1 Peter 4 and verse number 10, that we're to be good stewards of the manifold grace

00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:19.220
of God. That as God has enabled and equipped us, that we're good stewards, that we're faithful

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.699
with that which he has entrusted us with. That we recognize that God has given us the

00:25:24.699 --> 00:25:30.619
ability to serve him. Paul says it this way. I think about the testimony of Paul when I

00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:35.380
rejoice for this ability to serve the Lord, but I see Paul rejoicing as well to the same

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.859
group of people. Notice in 1 Corinthians 15, we were there in chapter 12 just a moment

00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:45.899
ago, just a few chapters over. Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:51.220
10. As the apostle Paul would understand that it was the Lord that equipped him, that gave

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.899
him the ability and that Paul had the privilege of serving the Lord and the various ways in

00:25:56.899 --> 00:26:01.459
which he had the privilege of serving the Lord. He says this in verse 10 of 1 Corinthians

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:10.059
15, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. He says in his grace, which was bestowed upon

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:17.019
me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:24.019
God which was with me. Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach and so ye

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:29.619
believed. Remember there's division in Corinth. I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos and Cephas and

00:26:29.619 --> 00:26:33.660
so on and so forth and we find that Paul is saying, listen God, I am what I am by the

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:40.239
grace of God. God has enabled me and God has equipped me and Paul is rejoicing for the

00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:45.299
opportunity that he had. He says that I'm laboring, I'm labored more abundantly than

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:49.979
they all. Why? Not because he wanted to be a good steward of the manifold grace of God.

00:26:49.979 --> 00:26:54.660
God used Peter to pen those words in 1 Peter 4 and verse number 10, but no doubt Paul is

00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:00.459
an example of an individual that had been equipped and enabled by God who was a good

00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:06.660
steward of the manifold grace of God. He says this as he's writing to the folks in Thessalonica.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.979
Notice in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 2, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, notice what

00:27:12.139 --> 00:27:18.059
Paul says. Again, this ability that we have in rejoicing for the ability to serve the

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:24.579
Lord. Again, my attitude as I review my attitude, it's a get to situation, not a have to situation.

00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:27.539
Now the bottom line is that really if you were to dig real deep, you really do have

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:30.660
to serve the Lord because you need to be a good, at least you're going to stand before

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.899
Christ. You're going to give an account. You're going to give an account. But man, I get to.

00:27:35.899 --> 00:27:41.579
I get to serve him. I get to serve him. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, notice what Paul

00:27:41.579 --> 00:27:50.139
says in chapter 2 and verse number 4. He says, but as we were allowed of God to be

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:57.459
put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but who? But God, which

00:27:57.459 --> 00:28:04.000
trieth our hearts. Why? For the audience of one. For the audience of one. Paul says as

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.820
he went into Thessalonica and he's preaching the gospel and of course all that was taking

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:14.299
place with regard to the persecution during that particular era of his missionary journey

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:20.100
and we see that his attitude is this. We were allowed of God. I had the privilege. I had

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.579
the opportunity. It was a delight. But Paul, you suffered. But Paul, you were persecuted.

00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:33.739
But I was allowed of God. God entrusted me. God allowed me to do this. But Paul, you suffered.

00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:39.619
But it was worth it. You read 2 Corinthians chapter number 4. He says it's worth it. It's

00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:45.380
worth it. And he says here that we were put in trust with the gospel even so we speak

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:52.580
not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. You know what happens when you

00:28:52.580 --> 00:29:00.020
try to please men? You fail. You know why you fail? Because it's impossible to please

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:06.299
everyone. It is absolutely impossible to please everyone. And if you want a case study

00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:12.619
on it, you can control the thermostat next week. You say, well that's such a simple thing.

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:20.419
You can't please everyone. Promise you. Promise you. But you know, it's for the audience of

00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:28.059
one when we serve the Lord. For the audience of one. We're serving God and He's the one

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:35.020
that tries the heart. By the way, I'm thankful. My heart's deceitful and so is yours. But

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:42.179
God, He trieth the heart. He knows. He knows your motive. He knows why you're serving Him.

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:47.859
He knows. He knows what your motive is. By the way, if your motive is to be recognized

00:29:47.859 --> 00:29:52.700
by man, you have your reward. Just go back to Matthew and read what he says about those

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.039
Pharisees and those Sadducees. When they prayed those big high prayers and they wanted to

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:00.719
be noticed of men, they have their reward.

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:06.399
reward. That's what Jesus says. What's the reward? The applause of man. Did you hear

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:14.079
him? No, no, no. It's for the audience of one. And when our motive is to please Christ,

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:18.559
when our motive is to please Christ and to serve Christ and to do it with a pure heart

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:24.319
then he is the one that's exalted and magnified and it's all about him. Will you make people

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:30.339
upset? Yeah, you will. But when you keep your focus on I'm serving the Lord, I'm serving

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:36.579
the Lord. Paul says it this way in 1 Timothy chapter 1. Think about what Paul says here.

00:30:36.579 --> 00:30:42.179
It's a verse of scripture that Holly has on her signature of her email and I appreciate

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:48.939
this verse of scripture. Many of us have what we might refer to as a life verse. Maybe we

00:30:48.939 --> 00:30:54.419
sign a card or an email with a particular verse and again Holly has verse 12 of 1 Timothy

00:30:54.419 --> 00:31:00.139
1. I want you to notice what Paul says in this verse of scripture. And I thank Christ

00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:10.699
Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the

00:31:10.699 --> 00:31:21.859
ministry. Notice verse 13 with it. Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious

00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:27.979
but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. Listen I'm thankful that I'm

00:31:27.979 --> 00:31:33.659
not what I used to be. In fact they sang about that this morning in that song. I'm a sinner

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:38.019
saved by grace and I'm not what I used to be. Aren't you thankful? I'm no longer a servant

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:41.859
of sin, Romans 6 we mentioned that in the beginning of the message. I'm now a servant

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:47.659
of righteousness and Paul says this is what I was before but now I have the privilege

00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:54.699
of serving the Lord and he says I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that

00:31:54.699 --> 00:32:01.379
he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry. What a great perspective. Rejoicing

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:05.819
for the ability to serve the Lord. Number three if you're taking notes we must review

00:32:05.819 --> 00:32:10.659
our attitude, we must rejoice for the ability but number three I want you to recognize what

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:17.419
is accomplished when we serve the Lord. Recognize what is accomplished when we serve the Lord.

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:22.219
Clearly our service to God is for the audience of one but I would submit to you this morning

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:29.939
that it has an impact on many. Our service to God is for the audience of one, the Lord

00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:37.179
Jesus Christ but it has an impact on many. We read already in 1 Corinthians chapter number

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:41.979
12 where the Bible said and we'll look at a couple of verses there in 1 Corinthians

00:32:41.979 --> 00:32:46.779
chapter 12 notice as we talked about the gifts of the Spirit he said I don't want you to

00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:52.299
be ignorant concerning the spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 he mentioned in

00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:58.699
verse number 7 that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with

00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:06.659
all. And so as the body of Christ is assembled and the people of God are enabled and equipped

00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:12.159
and we serve the Lord it's yes for God to be glorified but we find that it will have

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:16.739
a profit on all. Notice this truth see the greatest aspect we talk about recognizing

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:22.339
what is accomplished when we serve the Lord is that he is glorified. He's glorified.

00:33:22.339 --> 00:33:27.679
If our service to God is done the way that we've spoken of thus far in the sermon this

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:33.059
morning then God is glorified. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:37.539
good works and do what? Glorify your Father which is in heaven. Is that what the Bible

00:33:37.539 --> 00:33:44.079
tells us? Those are the words of Jesus and we find that that's the purpose right? Notice

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:49.819
in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we look at verse 18 it says but now hath God set the members

00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:57.659
every one of them in the body notice as it hath pleased him and for the glory of God.

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:04.259
See it's his church and in his church he is to receive glory and when we serve the Lord

00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:08.059
every single one of us as we serve the Lord in the manner in which God has enabled us

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:12.799
to serve the Lord and we're good stewards of the manifold grace of God and we're serving

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:19.939
God out of that pure heart in doing what he's called us to do then God is glorified. He's

00:34:19.939 --> 00:34:25.219
exalted and he's magnified. Look at 1 Peter chapter 4 we referenced verse number 10 earlier

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.819
that the Bible talks about being a good steward of the manifold grace of God but I want you

00:34:28.819 --> 00:34:35.819
to see what the Bible says in verse number 11. In 1 Peter chapter 4 we find that every

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:40.339
man hath received the gift and we're thankful for that and we're to be good stewards of

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:47.359
the manifold grace of God but verse number 11 of 1 Peter 4 says this if any man speak

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:53.579
let him speak as the oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as of the ability

00:34:53.579 --> 00:35:00.159
which God giveth and notice this phrase that God in all things may be glorified through

00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:07.159
Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever amen. In Ephesians 4 we won't

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:14.839
take the time to turn there but we spoke in that portion of scripture how the Lord gave

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:22.219
some to the church. He gave the evangelists, some apostles, evangelists, pastors, teachers

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:27.699
and he said why for the perfecting of the saints. It's that God would be glorified but

00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:34.699
number two so that God's people would be edified. What is accomplished when we serve the Lord?

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:39.759
We must recognize what's accomplished when we serve the Lord and by the way all of these

00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:44.759
things are connected. When I recognize what's accomplished it's going to impact, it's going

00:35:44.759 --> 00:35:48.859
to help me have the right attitude. When I understand that it's him that's given me the

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:52.319
ability it's going to help me to have the right attitude. When I have the right attitude

00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:55.919
then I'm going to serve him the way that I'm supposed to with a pure heart and not for

00:35:55.919 --> 00:35:59.439
any kind of man accolades and recognition but I'm going to serve the Lord with that

00:35:59.439 --> 00:36:03.279
pure heart and it's going to accomplish what it's supposed to accomplish. Number one for

00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:10.379
God to be glorified but number two for God's people to be edified. For the profit of all.

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:16.499
That God's people would be edified. That word means to be built up. We find that it's a

00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:22.319
word the Greek word would often in this particular era be used with regard to the construction

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:27.579
of a building and thinking about the edification and how people are to be built up and we find

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:30.979
that the Bible says for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,

00:36:30.979 --> 00:36:36.479
for the edifying of the body of Christ in Ephesians 4 and verse number 12 and we find

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:41.759
that God's people are to be edified and as we serve again, as we serve God it's for the

00:36:41.759 --> 00:36:48.399
audience of one but it has an impact on many. It's for the audience of one but it has an

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:55.399
impact on many and we have been given the opportunity to serve the Lord. What a privilege.

00:36:56.319 --> 00:37:02.039
What a privilege as we examine our lives and understanding how great God is and certainly

00:37:02.039 --> 00:37:07.899
each of us would say great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. How has his greatness

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:13.879
impacted the way that I pray? But this morning how has his greatness impacted how I serve

00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:20.879
him? Because he's a great God. He's worthy of our best. Amen. He is worthy of our best.

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:26.839
I was reading an author a week ago and I was reading a particular author and he was quoting

00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:30.359
somebody else and I don't remember who he was quoting so I can't tell you who it was

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:33.339
because it wasn't the man that actually wrote the book that I was reading but he was quoting

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:38.679
somebody else and here's what he said. He said you and I have a best part of our day.

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:42.359
What he was talking about is like some people are morning people, some people are evening

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:47.359
people, whatever. We know what the best part of our day is. He said you know what I try

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:52.879
to do in my life? I try to give God the best part of my day. The best. Why? Because he

00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:58.319
deserves it. You go over and read the book of Malachi. What a convicting book. They're

00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:03.319
bringing some offerings but God says no, no, no would you take that to your governor? No

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:09.219
you wouldn't. So why are you bringing it to me? I'm a great God and he is. Listen I know

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:13.399
we've joked and I've said it before about that phraseology of it's good enough for government

00:38:13.399 --> 00:38:21.559
work. Listen it's not good. Our best is what God deserves. By the way aren't you thankful

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:29.839
that he gave you his best? I don't want to just mail it in. I don't want to just kind

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:37.359
of go through the motions. No, no he deserves my best. He deserves your best. Let me use

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:42.199
an example in closing this morning. An example from the Old Testament. Turn back to the book

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:46.719
of Exodus if you will. We won't take time to look through all of it. In fact it would

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:51.159
be a sermon series to look at all of it. But I want you to look at Exodus 36 and we're

00:38:51.159 --> 00:38:55.839
going to kind of walk our way through a few verses of scripture throughout the end of

00:38:55.839 --> 00:39:03.039
the book of Exodus here this morning in closing. With this idea of our service to God for the

00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:08.919
audience of one. As we examine our lives and we begin to consider how is my service to

00:39:08.919 --> 00:39:14.879
God? What am I doing for God? How am I serving God? I hope that you have an answer for that

00:39:14.879 --> 00:39:20.519
question because God has equipped you. He's enabled you. He's given us the opportunity,

00:39:20.519 --> 00:39:26.599
the ability to serve him. What a privilege it is. We find that in the book of Exodus

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:29.599
there's a lot of things that are taking place in the book of Exodus. Of course God is bringing

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:35.279
his people out of Egyptian captivity, Egyptian bondage and as God would bring his people

00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:40.079
out we find that God gives them instruction. He takes Moses up and gives them the Ten Commandments

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:44.479
and so on and so forth and the law. He provides for them. The people break even the law as

00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:50.079
he's up there and receiving instruction with regard to the construction of the tabernacle.

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:54.919
And many of us would be familiar with the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The gathering

00:39:54.919 --> 00:39:58.919
place, the meeting place, the worshipping place if you will for the children of Israel

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:00.719
until the time of...

00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:07.599
Solomon when the temple would be built. So, for a number of generations, it was that God's

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:14.639
presence was known physically on earth through the tabernacle. We find that the Bible tells us,

00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:22.559
and what a joy, in the book of John, that Jesus, he dwelt among us, and that Greek word truly is

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:27.919
tabernacled amongst us. What a privilege and what a blessing. You think about the incarnation.

00:40:27.919 --> 00:40:32.959
But here, we think about the construction of the tabernacle. All of the instruction is given.

00:40:32.959 --> 00:40:37.519
If you were to study the book of Exodus, and if you were to have an idea of the tabernacle,

00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:43.999
and all of the intricacies. I mean, it was a very elaborate structure. There was a lot of work that

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:48.879
took place. But I want you to understand that if you were to study through the book of Exodus,

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:54.639
and begin to try to nail down a time frame, it's about five to six months that it took

00:40:54.639 --> 00:41:00.959
them to construct the tabernacle. Now, that's pretty amazing. When you consider all that was

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:05.439
involved with the tabernacle, and all of the pieces of furniture, and the elaborate work,

00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:10.479
five to six months for its completion. And we think about this truth as we look at this idea

00:41:10.479 --> 00:41:14.639
of our service to the Lord. And as we think about the construction of the tabernacle,

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:20.239
God had equipped Bezalel and Aholiab. He gives us their names specifically. And by the way,

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:26.079
he told Moses about them, not only equipping them for the work, but enabling them to teach others

00:41:26.799 --> 00:41:31.839
how to do those things. But we find that as we look here, and we think about their work for God,

00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:35.839
the Bible tells us in Exodus 36, in verse number one, notice it says,

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:42.559
then wrought Bezalel and Aholiab, notice, and every wise-hearted man. And then notice this phrase,

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:49.599
in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:55.999
for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the Lord had commanded. So,

00:41:55.999 --> 00:42:01.599
who was it that equipped them? It was the Lord. Who was it that equips you? It's the Lord.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:06.959
We've belabored the point in the New Testament this morning, for us as God's people in 2023,

00:42:06.959 --> 00:42:12.959
that God has equipped and enabled us. And here, as we look at this Old Testament illustration

00:42:12.959 --> 00:42:18.879
to prove the point this morning, to nail it home, if you will, that it was God who had given

00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:25.599
to Bezalel, Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, the Lord put wisdom and understanding

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:30.799
to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all the

00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:35.679
Lord had commanded. Notice verse two, and Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab and every wise-hearted

00:42:35.679 --> 00:42:41.279
man, in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, and every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto

00:42:41.279 --> 00:42:49.919
the work. Notice these words, to do it. What a privilege. I don't know. God doesn't tell us a

00:42:49.919 --> 00:42:58.319
whole lot about Bezalel or Aholiab. The other men aren't even name by name. But I'd like to think

00:42:59.759 --> 00:43:07.759
that these men had a perspective of who am I that God would allow me to be used in this manner.

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:15.919
Who am I that I would be privileged, that God would enable me to make these pieces of furniture

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:23.759
that would be within the holy place and even the holy of holies. It's amazing. And they were

00:43:23.759 --> 00:43:29.519
equipped, but they had to do the work. They were equipped for it, but they had to do it.

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:33.679
We've been equipped, we've been enabled, we've been given a gift, but we better use it.

00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:43.359
We better use it. And we find in chapter 36 that God tells us how they were to do the work and how

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:49.759
the people brought the materials that were needed. And you read through chapter 36 and 37 and 38 and

00:43:49.759 --> 00:43:54.639
you find that throughout these chapters that they're working and they're working diligently.

00:43:55.519 --> 00:43:59.999
They're working. It seems as if as you read the chapters here in the book of Exodus that it's a

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:04.879
delight for them. You don't see Moses having to run around and try to, hey, let's go guys, we got

00:44:04.879 --> 00:44:10.399
to get this done. Let's go. No, no, it looks like it's a delight. It's just joy. We sing the song,

00:44:10.399 --> 00:44:16.959
there's joy in serving Jesus. And here they're serving the Lord. And you come to chapter 39

00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:23.599
of the book of Exodus and look down, if you will, at verse number 32. The Bible says,

00:44:24.159 --> 00:44:26.639
I'll give you a moment, 39 and verse 32,

00:44:26.639 --> 00:44:33.519
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, look at that word,

00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:41.359
finished. It was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,

00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:49.039
so did they. They were faithful. Notice what it said, it was finished. They did the work that

00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:53.759
they did the work that God called them to do. Notice what it says, according to all that the

00:44:53.759 --> 00:45:01.199
Lord commanded Moses, so did they. No shortcuts. They did it all. Notice in verse number 42,

00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:06.719
the end of the chapter, Exodus 39 verse 42, according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,

00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:13.679
so the children of Israel made all the work. And Moses did look upon all the work and behold,

00:45:13.679 --> 00:45:21.599
they had done it as the Lord had commanded. Even so had they done it and Moses blessed them.

00:45:23.039 --> 00:45:29.759
Wow. What an amazing time in Israel's history. Chapter 40 of the book of Exodus,

00:45:29.759 --> 00:45:35.279
one of my favorite chapters of the Bible, because you see what takes place with the

00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:39.839
rearing up of the tabernacle. We don't have time to read through it, but you'll notice if you read

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:45.599
it later on your own, that you'll find a number of references. In fact, 13 times from verse three

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:52.319
down through verse number 15, you read this statement, and thou shout. God told them what to

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:58.239
do. God explicitly explained to them the instruction that they're to follow. And then you find that the

00:45:58.239 --> 00:46:04.079
Bible tells us as the Lord commanded Moses, repeated seven times, and you find that they

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:10.399
did it. They did the work. They did what God called them to do. And you come to verse number 34.

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:15.039
And in Exodus chapter 40 and verse number 34, it starts with a word then.

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:24.079
Then. The word then is an interesting word because it means after something. After the Lord commanded

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:30.719
and after they did according to what the Lord commanded then. Then does not come

00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:39.839
if they don't do. Would you agree? We never read the end of Exodus 40 if they don't do as the Lord

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:45.519
commanded them to do. What is accomplished? What is it when we think about this truth of serving

00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:49.919
the Lord and we recognize what is accomplished when we serve the Lord? We've already noted

00:46:49.919 --> 00:46:54.879
their attitude. We've understood that God's given them the ability and we find what is accomplished.

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:59.519
Well, because they did the work, we're able to read the end of Exodus when the Bible says,

00:46:59.519 --> 00:47:11.759
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

00:47:12.399 --> 00:47:18.159
Verse 35, and Moses were not able to enter into the tent of the congregation. Why? Because the

00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:24.399
cloud abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. I hope that you'd agree

00:47:24.399 --> 00:47:30.799
with me this morning that here we would find that God is glorified. There's no, listen, there's no

00:47:30.799 --> 00:47:34.959
way that God would fill the tabernacle with his glory if he wasn't pleased with what they did.

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:41.919
And we find here that God's glory is manifested. His glory fills the tabernacle according to verse

00:47:41.919 --> 00:47:48.159
34 and verse number 35 and the Lord is exalted. The Lord is glorified. That's what happens in

00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:52.639
your life and in my life when we serve the Lord. Listen, God's not called any one of us to build a

00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:58.639
tabernacle. God's not called, he is, I'm thankful that my body is, when I got saved, when you got

00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:03.439
saved, our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Amen? That's what the New Testament believers,

00:48:03.439 --> 00:48:09.199
we understand that. You don't have to, God's not called you to do what he called a bezel on a holy

00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:13.999
abbey and these wise-hearted men, but we find that as they did what God called them to do,

00:48:13.999 --> 00:48:18.319
as they reviewed, they had the right attitude, they understood the ability that God gave,

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:24.879
and they accomplished bringing glory to God. That's the first and primary reason that we serve

00:48:24.879 --> 00:48:29.519
God is to bring honor and glory to him. But I said this is for the audience of one but has an impact

00:48:29.519 --> 00:48:38.000
on many. I want you to understand that for generations, for generations, the people of Israel

00:48:38.799 --> 00:48:44.559
went to a tabernacle and brought their offerings, pointing to Messiah who would one day come

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:52.399
because some people served the Lord. There's no record, none that I have found, if you found it,

00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:56.799
please help me, none that I have found where any of these pieces of furniture are ever remade

00:48:57.759 --> 00:49:04.799
before the construction of the temple. They did a thorough work. They were diligent in serving

00:49:04.799 --> 00:49:12.559
the Lord and generations of people were impacted because of their service to God. It was for the

00:49:13.279 --> 00:49:17.759
glory of God, but it had an impact on many. And I wonder this morning,

00:49:19.679 --> 00:49:25.599
does our service bring glory to God? How are we serving God? Is it bringing glory to him?

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:33.359
Who's it impacting? How is our service having an effect on others? What a joy to have the

00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:38.479
opportunity to serve the Lord. I think of some Bible characters that served the Lord and had

00:49:38.479 --> 00:49:44.239
a proper perspective and they understood what God had given them to do. And I think about the

00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:50.319
way in which David prepared for the house of the Lord, the temple, if you fast forward all of these

00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:56.639
generations later and you think about what God is doing and how David would prepare for the palace

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:59.679
and he says that the palace is not for man but it's for God.

00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:01.279
So therefore, what was David doing?

00:50:01.279 --> 00:50:05.399
Man, David was preparing with all of his might, the Bible tells us.

00:50:05.399 --> 00:50:12.439
He talks about how the house that God would dwell in, that Solomon would build, how that

00:50:12.439 --> 00:50:17.639
it was to be a great house and how it was to be magnificent and so on and so forth.

00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:21.639
And we find here that God would use David in this way.

00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:27.879
I think about the situation as you look at the, after the destruction of Jerusalem and

00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:33.799
the Babylonian captivity and all that takes place and you begin to think about the rebuilding

00:50:33.799 --> 00:50:38.839
and what takes place and those opposition and how that the Bible tells us that there

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:44.239
were some people that had the opportunity to go and to do a work and here the people

00:50:44.239 --> 00:50:49.099
were calling, hey, come down here and let's talk and let's do this and what have you and

00:50:49.099 --> 00:50:55.759
all of those that were trying to prevent the work of God from continuing to go forward.

00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:59.719
And we find that the perspective was that we're doing a great work.

00:50:59.719 --> 00:51:00.719
Why?

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:01.719
Because it's a work for God.

00:51:01.719 --> 00:51:04.059
It's a work for God.

00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:07.999
This morning as we serve the Lord, we're not serving men.

00:51:07.999 --> 00:51:11.799
As you serve in our church, you're not serving me as the pastor.

00:51:11.799 --> 00:51:14.319
You're serving the Lord.

00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:15.919
Does it profit with all?

00:51:15.919 --> 00:51:16.919
Sure it does.

00:51:16.919 --> 00:51:18.999
Does it have an impact on the whole body?

00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:19.999
Sure.

00:51:19.999 --> 00:51:23.999
That's how it's supposed to work ultimately to bring honor and glory to the Lord.

00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:28.239
And as we bring honor and glory to the Lord, then we have the opportunity to also have

00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:29.999
an impact on many.

00:51:29.999 --> 00:51:36.519
This morning for the audience of one, we serve a great God, a great, great God and He gives

00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:40.679
us the opportunity, the privilege of being able to serve Him.

00:51:40.679 --> 00:51:44.119
I wonder this morning, how's our attitude towards serving the Lord?

00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:46.079
How's our attitude?

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:50.719
Do we have the perspective that I have to do this or do we have the perspective that

00:51:50.719 --> 00:51:51.919
I get to do this?

00:51:51.919 --> 00:51:57.519
I hope this morning it's a get to perspective, that it's a delight, that there truly is joy

00:51:57.519 --> 00:52:00.719
in serving Jesus.

00:52:00.719 --> 00:52:02.899
Recognize this morning it's God who's given us the ability.

00:52:02.899 --> 00:52:06.079
We must remember that.

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:09.479
The only thing special about us is God.

00:52:09.479 --> 00:52:12.679
It's the only thing special about us.

00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:16.559
Paul said, I am what I am by the grace of God.

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:23.439
This morning we can accomplish great things as we serve the Lord, glorifying Him and then

00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:25.719
impacting others.

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:30.359
This morning for the audience of one, O Lord, would our service be pleasing to Thee?

00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:32.279
Would we have that right perspective?

00:52:32.279 --> 00:52:33.279
Let's pray.

00:52:33.279 --> 00:52:34.279
Father, we love You.

00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:36.359
How we thank You for loving us.

00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:42.199
We thank You for the opportunity that You've given us to gather, to hear from Your Word.

00:52:42.199 --> 00:52:48.879
Thank You for the examples of those in the Scriptures that served You faithfully.

00:52:48.879 --> 00:52:55.239
God I pray that You would help us to serve You faithfully and acceptably.

00:52:55.239 --> 00:53:00.399
Lord that we would evaluate our lives, our attitude toward our service to You.

00:53:00.399 --> 00:53:04.359
God I pray that we bring You honor and glory.

00:53:04.359 --> 00:53:08.799
I pray that others would be impacted by our service to Thee.

00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:11.799
Lord maybe there's someone here that's not sure of heaven.

00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:14.359
They've never been saved.

00:53:14.359 --> 00:53:15.959
God I pray that today they'd be saved.

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.519
They'd trust Christ as their Savior.

00:53:17.519 --> 00:53:20.519
You're understanding they could never work to get to heaven.

00:53:20.519 --> 00:53:23.359
They could never work to keep themselves saved.

00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:31.879
Yes, the Bible speaks of our works, our service, it's a result of being saved, not the means

00:53:31.879 --> 00:53:34.439
by which we are saved.

00:53:34.439 --> 00:53:38.079
God I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict that one that might be here, Lord,

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:41.399
that they would understand their need today to be saved.

00:53:41.399 --> 00:53:45.039
I pray for every child of God, Lord, as we've gathered this morning, we've been challenged

00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:46.439
by Your Word.

00:53:46.439 --> 00:53:51.359
I pray that we would evaluate our lives and our service to You.

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:55.719
God I pray that You'd help us to do what You've called us to do.

00:53:55.719 --> 00:53:59.839
That we would be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:03.739
That You would use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

00:54:03.739 --> 00:54:07.359
That many others would be impacted by our service.

00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:11.639
We'll thank You in these moments of invitation, Lord, for the work that You'll do.

00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:16.320
I pray that You'd have Your will and way in every individual that's gathered together.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320
We'll thank You for it.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320
In Christ's name we pray.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.320
Would you stand with me?

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.320
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.959
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she plays the altar is open.

00:54:25.959 --> 00:54:29.839
Maybe this morning you want to come and thank God for the opportunity to serve.

00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:34.279
Maybe this morning you've not been serving like you should be and maybe you want to come

00:54:34.279 --> 00:54:38.279
and ask God to help you in that particular area of your life.

00:54:38.279 --> 00:54:41.559
If you're not saved we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that

00:54:41.559 --> 00:54:44.119
heaven's your home as Kimberly plays the altar is open.
