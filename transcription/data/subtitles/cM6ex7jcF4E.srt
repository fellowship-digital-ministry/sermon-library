1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,079
A verse that we'll use as a springboard again into our lesson this evening, we've been dealing

2
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:09,939
with the subject matter of theology for the last several weeks as we have been looking

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:17,280
at the broader study of sound doctrine and the importance of understanding who God is.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,719
I'm so thankful over the last two weeks that we've had the privilege of being able to study

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,719
about the attributes of our God.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,719
I'm thankful that he has revealed himself to us in his precious word, and what a joy

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,040
to know him.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,680
What a joy it is that he wants us to know him, and it's certainly a blessing as we began

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
to look at the attributes of God.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,279
We spoke about the natural attributes, the fact that he's omniscient and omnipotent and

11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,000
omnipresent, that he is immutable.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,279
He never changes, the same yesterday and today and forever.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,400
And of course the fact that he is eternal, and what a blessing that is.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,080
As we began to look last week at the moral attributes of God, we dealt with the fact

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,239
that he is holy, he's righteous, he's faithful.

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,819
We said this, that he's compassionate, loving, gracious, and merciful.

17
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,319
And what a blessing.

18
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,879
And I mentioned to you that that's not really an exhaustive list of the moral attributes

19
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,879
of our God, and I'm so thankful to know that we serve the Lord God Almighty.

20
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,680
In Jeremiah 10, in verse number 6, we used it as a really an outline for our theology

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,440
study here over these past few weeks, and the Bible says there,

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,120
For as much as there is none like unto thee, O Lord, thou art great and thy name is great

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,639
in might.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
So this evening, we're going to deal with that last part of Jeremiah 10, in verse number

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,339
6, where the Bible says thy name is great in might.

26
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:54,839
If you're taking notes, I've simply entitled the message this evening, Thy Name is Great.

27
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:59,080
Here in Proverbs 18, the passage in which I've asked you to turn to this evening, in

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,040
verse number 10, I want you to notice the Bible says this,

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,919
The name of the Lord is a strong tower.

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,559
The righteous runneth into it and is safe.

31
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:17,839
What a great word picture that the Lord uses here with regard to speaking about the name

32
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,839
of the Lord.

33
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:24,440
You'll notice in your Bible that Lord there is in all caps, and that, of course, denotes

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520
the use of Yahweh or Jehovah.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,919
We'll get to that in our study this evening.

36
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,360
But the Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong tower.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,660
The righteous runneth into it and is safe.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,559
Let's turn this over in Psalm 148, if you will, and we'll be looking at a number of

39
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,940
verses tonight as we get into the names of God, is really what we're going to look at.

40
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,440
But in Psalm 148, in verse number 13, the Bible reveals to us the importance of praising

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
the Lord.

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,300
Of course, we see that throughout the Psalms and really the whole of Scripture, and He

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,779
is worthy of our praise.

44
00:02:56,779 --> 00:03:02,539
But the Bible says in Psalm 148, in verse number 13, let them praise the name of the

45
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,539
Lord.

46
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,539
Again, you see it's in all caps.

47
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:08,300
For His name alone is excellent.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,940
His glory is above the earth and heaven.

49
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,660
I hope this evening when we consider the subject matter of theology, when we consider who our

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,100
God is, that we truly stand in all of Him, and I hope this evening that we praise Him

51
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,179
in the manner in which we should.

52
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:31,339
We've often mentioned that He is worthy of our praise, and this evening as we begin to

53
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:35,820
look at the names of God, we're going to look at ten names of God in the Old Testament.

54
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,500
There's more that we can look at, but we're going to look at ten of them this evening.

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,380
And as we look at these ten names, we'll begin to see how that God, through the names that

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,740
are ascribed to Him, how He is revealing Himself to us.

57
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,259
And we understand that names, especially in the Old Testament, in biblical times, carried

58
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:00,699
great importance and significance, the meaning of the name.

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,860
You can speak to people and you ask them their name, and half of the people, you say,

60
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,580
what does your name mean?

61
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,740
They have no idea what their name means.

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,580
It's just not as common or significant in our culture today as it once was.

63
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,220
Of course, there are plenty of cultures around the world today that it still is a very significant

64
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,579
thing when you speak about a name and really the context of that name, the meaning of that

65
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,540
name, and what is being revealed.

66
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:32,700
And so when we think about God and His Word and giving us all of these names, we find

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,779
that He is revealing to us who He is.

68
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,820
He begins to also reveal to us several of His attributes.

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,899
We'll start with the first one in Genesis 1, all the way back in the beginning, Genesis

70
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,739
1 and verse number 1.

71
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:49,019
And the first name that we'll look at this evening is Elohim.

72
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,100
Elohim, it means God, it means the strong one.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,739
And the thing that's important when we understand here about the name Elohim is that we find

74
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:04,820
it here in Genesis 1 and verse number 1 when the Bible says, in the beginning, God created

75
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,260
the heaven and the earth.

76
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,220
And so we find that when the word Elohim, and it's used over 2,000 times in the Old

77
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,540
Testament in reference to our God, it often is referred, or excuse me, translated as God,

78
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,980
as it is here in this verse of Scripture in the beginning, God created the heaven and

79
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
the earth.

80
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,480
And we find that it means the strong one.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,700
It is carrying it with it, it's giving to us, revealing to us, even as we see here in

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,739
the first mention of this particular name, that He is the creator.

83
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:41,260
Now that's of significant importance, and we understand on Sunday evenings for a lengthy

84
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,459
period of time now, and we've taken some weeks off, and we'll get back to the study and we

85
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,779
kind of have bounced back and forth, but we've studied through the book of Genesis,

86
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:56,899
and we've gotten up to the 15th chapter, and we spent months just in the first 11 chapters

87
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,540
of the book of Genesis to really establish the foundation and to prove the truth that

88
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,100
our God is the creator.

89
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,820
Of course, we live in a time today in which the subject, the teaching of creation is often

90
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,700
mocked and ridiculed and looked down upon, but we understand that God first reveals Himself

91
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,940
to us as being the creator, the strong one.

92
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,540
We understand that He created everything out of nothing, that He spoke it all into existence.

93
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,380
As we look through Genesis chapter 1, and it will not be part of the study this evening,

94
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,140
but you'll note that the Bible says, and God said, and it was so.

95
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,380
And you see the power, the strength of God, and the word that is used here, the Hebrew

96
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,899
word or name for God is Elohim.

97
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,540
The second one that we'll look at this evening is Yahweh or Jehovah.

98
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,899
Now this is, of course, if we could use it this way, it would be referred to as the proper

99
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,540
name of God.

100
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,660
In fact, oftentimes when you would study and learn and read about those scribes and those

101
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,839
that would write out the scriptures, anytime they would come to the word Yahweh or Jehovah,

102
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,720
they would not use the vowels, just the consonants, and they would be very careful.

103
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,440
They would not speak the name Yahweh because of the reverence of the name of God.

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,679
We would say that it's His proper name, if you will.

105
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:26,559
It's used over 6,500 times in the Old Testament.

106
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:34,640
You'll find that a number of times, of course, Yahweh is the root word, Jehovah is a derivative

107
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,519
of that, and so the two together are used over 6,500 times in the Old Testament.

108
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,239
And it's interesting to know, of course, we'd understand that it's really Israel's covenant

109
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:51,920
God is another way of understanding and looking at the use of the word Yahweh or Jehovah,

110
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,220
but we begin to think about the reality of this name of God.

111
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,160
It means the self-existent one.

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,079
The self-existent one.

113
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,200
Now many times you'll be asked the question, I was asked the question on our own property

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,959
several, probably seven or eight weeks ago, someone was on our property, and I went to

115
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,679
chat with them to see what was going on, and they began to, we engaged in conversation,

116
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,399
and their question was, well, who made God?

117
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,119
And that was, they were being very smart-alecky, and just kind of, the reality is that God

118
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,839
is the self-existent one.

119
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:36,159
No one created God, He is the creator, and through the name Jehovah or Yahweh, and understanding

120
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,159
the fact that it's the self-existent one, you find that there's no creator outside of

121
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
Him.

122
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,979
He needed no one to create Him, because He is.

123
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:53,760
And it really could carry the idea of this definition, to be, to have life.

124
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,520
And you understand, really in Genesis 2, the first reference of Jehovah or Yahweh,

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,719
but really when we're given explanation as to the name, you have to go to Exodus chapter

126
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,719
number 3.

127
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:08,599
In Exodus chapter number 3, even as you're moving there in your Bible and going to that

128
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:13,820
portion of Scripture, for some of you, your mind probably races to the, really the context

129
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,799
of that passage of Scripture, dealing with the call of Moses.

130
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,440
You'll remember that God told Moses, when He appeared to him there in that burning bush,

131
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,280
and Moses saw that, and God told him that He was going to send him, and Moses questions,

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,719
he says, who am I, and all of that sort of thing.

133
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:38,719
But the reality is that he then asks a very good question, that is Moses asks a very good

134
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,840
question of God.

135
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,039
Notice in verse number 12 in Exodus chapter number 3, let's look at verse number 11, and

136
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,159
Moses said unto God, who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth

137
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,080
the children of Israel out of Egypt.

138
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,559
And God says, and He continues here, and it says, and He said, certainly I will be with

139
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,559
thee.

140
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,000
Now, consider that great promise.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,519
as we've mentioned that many times and even as we dealt with the attributes of God,

142
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,199
that He is omnipresent, He's promised His presence.

143
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,680
He tells Moses that He would be with him, it says,

144
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,520
And this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee,

145
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,639
when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt,

146
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,120
ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,280
And Moses said unto God,

148
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,399
Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them,

149
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,360
Notice what he says,

150
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,639
The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you.

151
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,319
Now, why does he say that?

152
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,759
Well, we understand previous in the text of Scripture

153
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,720
that God says to Moses that He is the God of their fathers.

154
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,680
In verse number six, it says,

155
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,

156
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,759
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

157
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,159
And so Moses understood that truth.

158
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,119
He says that he's going to go to the children of Israel

159
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,319
and he's going to say to them,

160
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,319
The God of your father hath sent me unto you,

161
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,439
and they shall say to me,

162
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,479
What is his name?

163
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,599
What shall I say unto them?

164
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,720
That's a good question.

165
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
It's an appropriate question.

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
It really is a reverent question.

167
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,160
And we find that God then reveals,

168
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
and we often look at the truth of this passage of Scripture,

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,879
and we rejoice greatly in understanding

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,199
the way in which God reveals great, significant truth to Moses,

171
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:27,199
and of course, through the preservation of the Word of God for us this evening as well.

172
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,000
And Jesus uses this in John 8.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,239
And what is said here in verse number 14,

174
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,680
God said unto Moses,

175
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,400
I am that I am.

176
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,319
And He said,

177
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,360
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

178
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,720
I am hath sent me unto you.

179
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
And so we find that God is then going to share with Moses

180
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,720
this great truth in verse 15.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
And God said moreover unto Moses,

182
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

183
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,919
The Lord God of your fathers,

184
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,959
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,

185
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,279
hath sent me unto you.

186
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,960
This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

187
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,160
And so this is really the explanation, if you will,

188
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,240
as we begin to find more of the revelation of this,

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
the use of this name Jehovah or Yahweh,

190
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
that He is the self-existent one.

191
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,820
I am.

192
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,960
I am that I am.

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,320
We see it in this verse of scripture.

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,960
Remember, Jesus said in John 8, in verse number 58,

195
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,039
when He's speaking to the religious leaders of the day,

196
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,679
He said that Abraham rejoiced to see his day.

197
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,720
Of course, they're talking about the fact that they're the seed of Abraham,

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,440
and they've never been in bondage and all of that sort of thing.

199
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,399
And Jesus says,

200
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,559
Abraham rejoiced to see my day.

201
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,119
And they said,

202
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,800
You're not even 50 years old yet.

203
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,440
What do you mean?

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,000
And He said,

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Before Abraham was, I am.

206
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
And you know, immediately at that time,

207
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,080
what did the religious leaders want to do?

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
They wanted to stone Jesus.

209
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,600
They wanted to kill Jesus.

210
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880
And what was the crime?

211
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
The crime would be that of blasphemy, is what they would accuse Him of.

212
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:04,960
Why?

213
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,919
Because they understood that when He said,

214
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,160
Before Abraham was, I am, that He was claiming to be God.

215
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,679
Because He is God.

216
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,919
And that's another study for another week.

217
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,000
But we find here the use of that word, of that name.

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,919
And again, really the proper name of God.

219
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,520
Notice over in Psalm 68.

220
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,559
I can already tell you we're not going to get through all 10 tonight.

221
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,199
Amen.

222
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,080
Psalm 68.

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,199
If you're sitting there wondering,

224
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,080
How are we going to do it?

225
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,039
We're not.

226
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,479
And I really had high ambitions of getting through it.

227
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,600
But that's okay.

228
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,119
And notice in verse number four of Psalm 68.

229
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,039
Psalm 68 in verse number four.

230
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
The Bible says this,

231
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,360
Sing unto God, sing praises to His name.

232
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
Extol Him that writeth upon the heavens by His name,

233
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,839
JAH, and rejoice before Him.

234
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,039
That, of course, is another derivative, if you will, an abbreviation for Jehovah.

235
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,800
And not used as often.

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,919
In fact, the Hebrew word there is often translated as Jehovah or Lord.

237
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,440
And it's important for us to understand this is, again,

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,080
if we could say a proper name for God,

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,240
we would say that it's Yahweh or Jehovah.

240
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Turn to the book of Isaiah.

241
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,519
We'll look at one more verse of scripture in Isaiah chapter 42.

242
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,239
Isaiah chapter 42.

243
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,760
And look at verse number eight.

244
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,799
Notice what the Lord says.

245
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,399
And again, it's important.

246
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,959
You've probably noticed as you've read your Bible,

247
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,279
as you read through the Old Testament,

248
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,440
there are times in which you see the word Lord translate in our English Bibles

249
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,119
with a capital L and then a lowercase O-R-D.

250
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,920
And then there are other times in which you see Lord translate it

251
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,279
with a capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D.

252
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
And when you see it in all caps, L-O-R-D,

253
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,959
that is this word, Yahweh or Jehovah, the self-existent one.

254
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
When you see the capital L with the lowercase O-R-D,

255
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,279
that's the next name of God that we're going to deal with,

256
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,160
and that's Adonai.

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
We'll look at that in just a moment.

258
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,920
But we see that that's the distinction in which the translators used

259
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,440
in distinguishing the name of God, Lord, L-O-R-D,

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,399
all caps being Jehovah or Yahweh,

261
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,559
and then Lord, capital L, lowercase O-R-D, dealing with Adonai.

262
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,720
Look here in Isaiah 42 in verse number eight.

263
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,519
Notice what it says.

264
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
I am the Lord.

265
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
It's all caps, right?

266
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
Is it all caps in your Bible?

267
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,359
That's the Hebrew word, Yahweh or Jehovah.

268
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,799
And the Bible says this,

269
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,959
that is my name.

270
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,119
In my glory will I not give to another,

271
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,320
neither my praise to graven images.

272
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,559
And this evening, again, as I said by way of introduction,

273
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,720
when we really look into the Old Testament

274
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
and we look at the usage of the names for God

275
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
and how it reveals to us who he is

276
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,320
and how he has given this truth to us,

277
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
it's important that we grasp this this evening

278
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,160
because there are many today

279
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,799
that will have that scoffing, mocking type of an approach.

280
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,480
When you say that God is the creator,

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
they want to know, well, who created God?

282
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
Well, no one, because he is the self-existent one.

283
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,839
He is Yahweh, Jehovah, that is his name.

284
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,559
And what a great truth of the word of God.

285
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm so thankful that God has revealed that to us.

286
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,559
The third one, if you're looking,

287
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,519
the third name this evening, Elohim, Jehovah, or Yahweh.

288
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,799
Number three, Adonai.

289
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,920
Now, Adonai, again, means Lord or Master.

290
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,440
It means this, my strength.

291
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
When we think about the particular use of the word Adonai

292
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,480
to mean Lord or Master,

293
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:49,200
we'll see that when referring to the Lord, God,

294
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,640
it will use that, in the English,

295
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,839
you'll have a capital L with a lowercase O-R-D.

296
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,760
As I mentioned just a moment ago

297
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,640
with regard to Yahweh and Jehovah with all caps.

298
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
You will find at times that Adonai

299
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
is not referring to Lord God,

300
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,359
but referring to just a master, a human being, an individual.

301
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,600
And it's interesting because during those times,

302
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,359
often you'll see that it's translated lowercase L-O-R-D.

303
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
Now, often we don't refer to people,

304
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,160
we don't call our boss Lord in our particular culture,

305
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
but we will find that they will use that word at times

306
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,920
and you'll see it translated that way.

307
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,119
Turn back to Genesis chapter number 15, if you will.

308
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,519
In Genesis chapter number 15,

309
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,000
and here we'll see that the Bible is going to use here

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,399
this name for God, Adonai.

311
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,119
And it actually has a compound name

312
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,160
because it says Lord God.

313
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
But notice here as Abram is responding to God

314
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,760
in verse number one,

315
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
we studied this just a few weeks ago on Sunday evenings,

316
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,239
but the Bible says after these things,

317
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,359
the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision.

318
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,679
Now you understand it says the word of the Lord,

319
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,920
how's it is all capital in your Bibles, right?

320
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,679
In verse number one.

321
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,600
And so Yahweh or Jehovah,

322
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,279
it came unto Abram in a vision saying,

323
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,119
fear not Abram, I am thy shield

324
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,640
and I exceeding great reward.

325
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
We discussed that.

326
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,959
What a joy to know how God was making himself

327
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,399
known to Abram in verse two.

328
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,959
And Abram said, Lord God.

329
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:24,480
Now Lord should be capital L in lowercase O-R-D.

330
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,200
That's the Hebrew word Adonai,

331
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,040
which carries with it again, master or my strength.

332
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Now, remember God has just said to Abram

333
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,159
as he gave him this vision.

334
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,520
He says, I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward.

335
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
And Abram then says, Lord God.

336
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,919
And realizing that God is his master, his Lord,

337
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,280
his strength.

338
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
It says this, what will not give me saying,

339
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
I go childless and the steward of my house

340
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,119
is this Eleazar of Damascus.

341
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,880
And we won't get into the context of that discussion,

342
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
looking at the name that is being used.

343
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,400
And really often you will find that this usage

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,799
of the word Adonai or the name Adonai

345
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
would be spoken in place of using Yahweh or Jehovah

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,840
in Jewish custom to display reverence.

347
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,799
And remember, as I mentioned about the usage

348
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,119
of the word or the name Yahweh or Jehovah,

349
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,880
they often would not speak the name of God,

350
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,159
Yahweh or Jehovah because of wanting to be reverent.

351
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,200
And they would use Adonai instead.

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,719
And we see here that it means Lord or master.

353
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:39,039
Now, this is interesting again,

354
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,359
as we begin to see how that God is revealing

355
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,440
who he is to us through his names.

356
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
He says, I'm Elohim.

357
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
I am God.

358
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,679
I am the strong one.

359
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,359
I am the creator.

360
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,000
And from that truth,

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,080
we find how it flows into really

362
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
the understanding who God is

363
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
and really the importance.

364
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,159
of understanding that God is the Creator and how important that is throughout all

365
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,279
of the Scriptures. Again, as we've mentioned about the subject of creation,

366
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,599
it's not simply isolated to the first few chapters of the book of Genesis. The

367
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,319
subject of creation is throughout the whole of Scripture, and we find that God

368
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,559
reveals himself as Elohim, that I'm the strong one, I'm the Creator. As Yahweh,

369
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:30,199
Jehovah, I am the self-existent one. To be, I am, and in him is life. We find that

370
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:37,839
then he uses the name Adonai, and really using that name denotes that he's Lord

371
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,599
or Master, and as our owner, if I could use that terminology this evening, as our

372
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,519
Lord, as our Master, then he rightly deserves our worship and our obedience.

373
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,519
And many times when we look at the New Testament, begin to think about the

374
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:00,919
way in which we would refer to the Lord as being our Lord, our Master, I'm

375
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,799
thankful that he's our Savior and our Redeemer, our God, but we begin to think

376
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,119
about the truth that I am not my own, right? I've been bought with a price, and

377
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,639
we go through that process and understanding that, and we find this

378
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:18,319
evening that as we would look at New Testament Christianity, we somehow along

379
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:25,399
the line maybe got our eyes off of the truth of him being our Master, and we

380
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:29,759
we've bought into this lie that we're our own people, we can do our own thing, I

381
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,799
can do what pleases me, and the reality is that all the way back here in the Old

382
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:40,399
Testament, when you use the name for God as Adonai, revealing and giving the

383
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,959
indication to his people that he is Lord or Master, yes, he is our strength, and for

384
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:51,639
that we are thankful, and we find that because he is our Lord or Master, that he

385
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:56,279
rightly deserves our worship and our obedience. Number four in your notes, if

386
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,279
you're taking notes this evening, the fourth name of God is El Shaddai, El

387
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,959
Shaddai. Now, Genesis chapter 17, if you will, just a page or two over in your

388
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:14,239
Bibles, and El Shaddai means the Lord God Almighty. You've often heard me use this

389
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,639
name of God as we find it revealed to Abraham here in Genesis chapter 17,

390
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,559
and you find that in verse number one of this passage, the Bible says, when Abram

391
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,759
was 90 years old and nine, the LORD, again it's all caps in your Bible, right, Yahweh,

392
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:42,599
Jehovah, appeared to Abram and said unto him, I am the Almighty God. El Shaddai. I

393
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:48,199
am the Almighty God. And then he says this, walk before me and be thou perfect.

394
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:54,359
Now, we understand this evening that as we look at this name for God, how that it

395
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,679
would cause us to rejoice greatly, and understanding that he is the most

396
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,479
powerful. We mentioned as we studied the attributes of God, how that he is

397
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:08,599
omnipotent, that he has all power, and the book of Revelation tells us that the Lord

398
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:13,279
God omnipotent reigneth, and how that ought to cause us to rejoice this

399
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,559
evening, and when we understand that he is the Lord God Almighty, that he is El

400
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,839
Shaddai, the all-sufficient one, he is our nourishment, he is the most powerful one.

401
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:32,199
Now, I want you to think about that this evening. How does that impact us? When we

402
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:37,759
know that the Lord God Almighty has revealed himself in the scriptures as

403
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:45,159
being omnipotent, when he says to Abraham here in Genesis 17, he says, I am the

404
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,159
Almighty God, El Shaddai. Now, you understand this evening, when we

405
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,679
understand who he is, when we understand the truth that is revealed to us through

406
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,479
the names that are given to God, that God has given to himself, we find

407
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:07,639
that he's revealing these bits of truth to us to impact our daily living. So, he

408
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:14,279
tells Abraham in Genesis chapter number 17, he appears to Abraham, Yahweh

409
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,679
Jehovah, the Lord appears to Abraham and says, I am the Lord God Almighty, I am El

410
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,199
Shaddai, and then, if you fast-forward in your mind to Genesis chapter number 18,

411
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:30,959
just to really, of course, in our Bibles it's a chapter division, but not long

412
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:37,079
thereafter, after God would reveal himself to Abraham in this way, God asks

413
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:45,319
Abraham this question in Genesis 18 and verse number 14, is anything too hard for

414
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:53,519
the Lord? Now, I'm thankful that God in his wisdom, and he has perfect wisdom, that

415
00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:00,399
God first revealed himself to Abraham as El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty. He

416
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:06,599
revealed himself to Abraham as being the most powerful, the all-sufficient one, El

417
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:16,119
Shaddai, and then he asks Abraham, is anything too hard for me? Now, Abraham has

418
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:21,719
just had this new revelation. Remember, as we've been studying the book of Genesis,

419
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:25,639
we made note, and we'll look at it probably next week because we won't get

420
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:32,759
it to this evening, but how that God had revealed himself to Abram in Genesis

421
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,919
chapter number 14 as being the most high God. Remember that interaction

422
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,839
between Abram and Melchizedek, and the king of Salem came, and he said that he

423
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,599
was the the most high God, and how that was the first usage of the name of God

424
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:51,559
in that manner, and here in Genesis 17, before he asks Abraham, is anything too

425
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,719
hard for me? He says, I want you to know my name, El Shaddai. I want you to know

426
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:01,719
that I'm the Lord God Almighty. In this evening, God has revealed himself to us

427
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:07,519
as being El Shaddai. He has given to us the whole canon of Scripture that's

428
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,639
been preserved for us this evening, and we have not only the declaration of

429
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:15,759
God's power, the fact that He's omnipotent, the names that would support

430
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:22,119
it, but we have ample illustrations, and I mean, just so many examples that we

431
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,559
could go to this evening within the Word of God to show the power of God, and I

432
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,519
wonder this evening if he came to you, or if he came to me, and he said, is there

433
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:39,039
anything too hard for me? I know the right answer that we would give. I know

434
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,519
the Bible answer. The Bible answer is, no. There's nothing too hard for God, correct?

435
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:52,039
You believe that this evening? That's the proper Bible answer, but I wonder this

436
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,719
evening, do I live my life daily understanding that there's nothing too

437
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:02,679
hard for God? Do you live your life daily understanding there's nothing too

438
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,919
difficult for Him? We can sing songs about it. We can reference verses about

439
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,279
it, but the reality is that God is revealing Himself to us. He's using names

440
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,239
in the Old Testament as our study is this evening looking at the names of God.

441
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:22,199
He's using these names in order to reveal these truths about Himself, and in

442
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:26,999
this particular instance, he says to Abraham that he's the Lord God Almighty,

443
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:33,079
then he asks him just a chapter later in our Bibles, is anything too hard for the

444
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:38,279
Lord? Of course, he's speaking contextually about the fact that he and

445
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:45,679
Sarah would have a child. Sarah had just laughed about the promise of God. She was

446
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:54,399
old. He was old. It's past the time for this to happen. God says, I work best in

447
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,319
the times of the impossible, right? Because it's in those times that He's

448
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,559
glorified. It's in those times that He alone will receive the glory that is due

449
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,879
unto His name. Number five, and we'll finish up this evening, and it's a

450
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:14,479
precious one, one in which we are very familiar with, Jehovah Ra. Jehovah Ra, and

451
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,879
we'll go to Psalm 23 for that one, and so you probably already know just by

452
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:26,439
turning to the passage that Jehovah Ra is the Lord is my shepherd. The Lord is my

453
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:33,839
shepherd. That is the Hebrew name of God, the Lord is my shepherd, Jehovah Ra, and

454
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,760
you see it here in verse number one of Psalm 23, and again, it's a compound name

455
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,399
where the Bible says the Lord. Again, you see it as Yahweh Jehovah, all caps in

456
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:52,119
your Bible. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Jehovah Ra, the Lord is

457
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,440
my shepherd. You understand throughout the scriptures, and I will not belabor

458
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,880
the point, we'll get to prayer time here in just a moment, but you understand that

459
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,559
throughout the scriptures that God will use the analogy of people being sheep,

460
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,919
and we find that especially in the New Testament. You'll find it, you find it in

461
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,519
the Old Testament where he speaks about his people not having a shepherd and so

462
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,159
on and so forth, speaking about the leaders and so on and so forth, and here

463
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,519
David, of course, it's a sweet psalm of David, we're familiar with Psalm 23, what

464
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,079
a precious, precious passage it is, but when the Bible says the Lord is my

465
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,679
shepherd, I shall not want, and we understand this evening the way that the

466
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,679
shepherd takes care of the sheep. We understand the role and responsibility, even

467
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:42,799
though we may not live in a herding industry type of a place where we have

468
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,880
ever perhaps even participated in some of the work of a shepherd, you can read

469
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,799
books on it, you can read analogies, you can study the scriptures that deal with

470
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,519
it, and you can understand this evening that when the psalmist, who by him, by the

471
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,919
way, was a shepherd, right?

472
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,759
David was a shepherd, that he understood what his role and responsibility was as a shepherd.

473
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,079
By the way, when the bear and the lion came to take care of the sheep, what did the shepherd

474
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,639
David do?

475
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:16,679
He protected them, did he not?

476
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,039
Now, his shepherd, God, gave him the ability, gave him the power, and he testifies of that

477
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:30,359
when he stands before Saul in 1 Samuel chapter number 17, he gives glory to God for giving

478
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,199
that victory and that deliverance, but we find here as we look at this verse of Scripture

479
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:42,659
that David, as a shepherd, would have understood the profound truth that is found in this name

480
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,439
of God, Jehovah-Ra, that the Lord is my shepherd, and that means he cares for me, he takes care

481
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:53,939
of my needs, he provides for me, he says, I shall not want, and we think about the way

482
00:30:53,939 --> 00:31:01,899
in which the shepherd is providing and protecting, and we think about the presence of a shepherd.

483
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:05,699
Sheep are really, really nervous animals.

484
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:12,499
They really have no built, they have no good defense in and of themselves.

485
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:17,579
Very vulnerable animals, if they get alone by themselves, they're extremely vulnerable,

486
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,019
and so the presence of the shepherd gives them a sense of calmness, and it's amazing

487
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,619
if you read some books on shepherding and understand some of the analogy, it helps us

488
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:31,019
to understand even this truth in the Word of God that the Lord is my shepherd.

489
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,859
I spent some time earlier this year looking through Psalm 23 and speaking about the fact

490
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:41,139
that the Bible does reveal to us that he is the shepherd, he's the good shepherd, the

491
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:47,259
great shepherd, the chief shepherd, but the profound nature of the statement that is made

492
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:53,899
in Psalm 23 when he says, the Lord is my shepherd, it's personal.

493
00:31:53,899 --> 00:32:02,339
And what a blessing to know as God would reveal himself, Jehovah Ra, the Lord is my shepherd,

494
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:10,939
think about the peace that would be in the heart and life of the believer understanding

495
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:14,779
the name of God, Jehovah Ra, the Lord is my shepherd.

496
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:22,059
Oh, it gives me a sense of peace and calmness, understanding that the shepherd knows, listen,

497
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:26,419
the sheep don't have to know where the green pasture is, the shepherd's going to lead them

498
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:29,179
to the green pasture, amen?

499
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:33,859
The shepherd does, excuse me, the sheep, they don't understand where their next meal or

500
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:39,099
their water or their provision, where all of that, but the shepherd is going to provide

501
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,099
for them.

502
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:47,139
And in simple faith, we rest in the fact this evening that the Lord is my shepherd, Jehovah

503
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,379
Ra.

504
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,459
We think about these names of God, I intended to get through ten of them this evening, but

505
00:32:52,459 --> 00:33:00,899
we look at five of them, and as we think about these five, Elohim, Yahweh, or Jehovah, Adonai,

506
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:06,899
and we looked at, what was the fourth one, let me see here, the fourth one was El Shaddai

507
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,939
and then Jehovah Ra.

508
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:14,579
And I hope this evening that just as these Old Testament Bible characters, as they understood

509
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:17,659
the names of God, it would have had an impact in their lives.

510
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:22,259
I hope tonight that as we think about the names of God, these five, we'll study the

511
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,939
next five next Wednesday evening, I hope that it encourages us, I hope that it strengthens

512
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:35,539
our faith, and that we have this sense of peace and calmness, understanding who our

513
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,779
God is, even through studying the names of God.

514
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:40,779
Let's pray.

515
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,059
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us.

516
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:48,259
Thank you for your word, thank you for the way in which the names of God have revealed

517
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,699
to us who you are and what you do.

518
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:56,619
And God, I pray tonight that each person that is gathered here, those that have gathered

519
00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:02,059
and tuned in via live stream, God, that we've been encouraged tonight as we've studied

520
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:06,019
these five names of God.

521
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,659
Help us, Lord, in our time of prayer.

522
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,339
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

523
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,819
I pray that you'd be glorified and we'll thank you for it.

524
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:15,179
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

525
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,459
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
