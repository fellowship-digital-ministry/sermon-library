WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Of course, we're continuing our series here on Ask the Pastor, and just a couple of weeks

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.199
ago, I dealt with the subject matter of Tell Us Plainly was the title of the message and

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:15.479
dealing with why Jesus is God, really dealing with the deity of Christ, and answering the

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:24.200
question with regard to why it seems as if this fundamental truth is masked, if you will.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.440
And I remember the Jews, they said to Jesus, Tell Us Plainly, and He says, I told you and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440
you believe not.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.559
So that was a couple of lessons ago.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.360
And then last week, we answered the question with regard to the ministry of the Holy Spirit

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.959
and dealt with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:51.520
This evening, as we continue our series, the question simply reads this, Explain the Trinity.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.720
Okay, explain the Trinity.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.360
And I only laugh because, let me say this, God's ways are not our ways.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.199
He transcends us, amen?

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:13.519
And so the best that we can do in our finite minds of trying to define and describe an

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.720
infinite God is always going to fall short, amen?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.559
And most people that have an issue with the teaching of God's Word that leads us to the

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:32.120
doctrine or the statement of speaking about the Trinity or a triunity, they say that they

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.720
resist it or reject it because it just doesn't make sense.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.440
And the reality is that if God made sense, then would He really still be God?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.879
We could ask ourselves the question in that way.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.760
In other words, not that God is chaotic or anything like that, but the reality is that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.120
if I could bring God down to my level, if you could bring God down to your level, then

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.440
what makes Him God?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.680
The reality this evening is that as we look at this subject and seek to answer the question

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.039
or really the idea here, Explain the Trinity, I remember a quote that I read years and years

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.600
ago, and I dug out the quote from my files, and it was a quote from Augustine.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.619
And some of you will be mindful of this theologian of yesteryear.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.300
We would not agree, perhaps, with everything, of course, but the reality is that this quote

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.419
is pertinent to the subject matter this evening.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:30.059
Augustine was wrestling in his mind, seeking to explain the Trinity.

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:35.139
He says, one day while walking along the seashore, he saw a little boy digging a trench in the

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.139
sand.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.979
And he asked the lad what meant he to do, and the little boy told Augustine that he

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:47.500
wanted to empty the sea into his trench.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.940
That was perplexing to Augustine as he heard the little boy say that, and Augustine said

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.979
to himself, am I not trying to do the same thing as this child?

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:07.860
Seeking to exhaust, with my reasoning, the infinite God, and to collect within me, to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.259
collect it, the Lord, the infinity of God, within the limits of my own mind.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:21.300
Someone else said this, limiting God to our understanding is making ourselves equal to

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.339
God in understanding.

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:28.419
The reality is that I'm not equal to God in understanding, and neither are you.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.259
And this evening we look at 1 John 5 and verse number 7.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:37.419
The Bible says, for there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.100
the Holy Ghost.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.580
And these three are one.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.419
Understand when he says the Father, we're speaking of God the Father.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.539
When he says the Word, we're speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:53.500
That is a title, a name that is ascribed to Jesus Christ, John 1.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.660
Of course, John would be familiar with that title or that name, and then the Holy Ghost,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.020
the Holy Spirit of God.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.699
You notice the Bible says, and these three are one.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.580
In many of the modern translations of today, you'll find that 1 John 5, 7 is just, in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.539
many of them, it's completely missing.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.220
It's just not even there.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.699
Or they'll just have a very basic statement that does not really capture the truth, the

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.700
1 John 5, 7, that we find in our Bibles.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.019
And then they'll put something like this.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.260
In fact, in some of the study Bibles today, even if you have a King James study Bible,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.220
you understand that the notes aren't preserved or inspired, that the notes in the study Bible,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.820
there's some guy, some man's notes and their thoughts.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.220
In many of the study Bibles, even if it's a King James Bible, many of the study Bibles

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.100
will have a note with regard to 1 John 5, 7, and will say something like this, not found

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.980
in many manuscripts, again, seeking to undermine the teaching and the authority of God's Word

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.019
with regard to the subject matter of the Trinity.

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:53.500
Now let me ask you this.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.220
Why is it that Satan would have an all-out assault on the person of Jesus Christ?

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:05.179
Well, because salvation is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.420
And if you do not have the understanding, the truth of God's Word with regard to the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.859
person of Jesus Christ, you miss it on salvation.

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:17.679
You've just messed up the whole deal.

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:23.299
And so we understand this evening, we can kind of comprehend why there's such an attack

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:28.820
on the person of Jesus Christ, why there's such an attack on the teaching of the Trinity.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:36.140
And we find that here we're not seeking to limit our, limiting God to our understanding.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.739
We readily acknowledge this evening that God, His ways are higher than our ways.

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:47.500
Notice what the Bible says in Isaiah 55, and we're familiar with this portion of Scripture

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.339
in Isaiah 55, but I thought it necessary to read these couple of verses and then read

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.339
a verse over the book of Psalms before we really get into the message this evening.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:04.380
And I give my feeble attempt to try to answer such a great truth of God's Word that must

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.100
be accepted by faith.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.619
And the Bible says that without faith, it's impossible to please Him.

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:15.339
He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and He's a rewarder of them that diligently

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.619
seek Him in Hebrews 11, in verse number 6.

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:25.260
Here in Hebrew, in Isaiah 55, notice what Isaiah 55 says in verse number 8, my thoughts

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:34.260
are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.660
By the way, aren't you thankful?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.540
Aren't you thankful that God's thoughts are not our thoughts?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.779
That God's ways are not our ways?

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.220
I mean, I'm so thankful that He transcends us.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.579
The next verse, verse 9, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.459
higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.059
And we ought to rejoice in that, in understanding that our God, who is an infinite God, a God

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:07.459
who transcends us, and He has given us the revealed Word of God, He sought to give and

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:14.299
to explain to us as human beings, remember the Scriptures tell us that He knows our frame.

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:20.899
He's the one that's created us, He knows us, and He's given us the Word of God to reveal

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.179
Himself to us.

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:30.799
And we find that as we understand this infinite God that transcends us, that He would desire

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:37.739
to have a relationship with us as human beings.

00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:38.739
It's amazing.

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:46.100
It's amazing that God would love us, that God would care so much about us, that God

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.380
would want us to know who He is.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.940
And I think about the statement of Moses, and I think about the statement of Paul when

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.660
they both expressed their desire to know God.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.140
And I think about the truth of if we really want to know God, we need to know His Word,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.299
and we dig into His Word, and we accept by faith what God has told us in His Word regarding

00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:13.420
who He is.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.299
And notice what Psalm 147 says, we'll read that verse and I'll get into some thoughts

00:08:17.299 --> 00:08:18.500
tonight.

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:24.260
Psalm 147 and verse number 5, notice here what the psalmist says, again we would be

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
mindful that just a couple of psalms before, the Bible talks to us about the fact that

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.500
our God is a great God and that His greatness is unsearchable.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.419
But then notice here in Psalm 147, it starts out by giving the truth of praising the Lord.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.340
Praise you the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for it is pleasant and

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.099
praise is comely.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:49.419
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel, He healeth

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:54.820
the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds, He telleth the number of the stars, He calleth

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.059
them all by their names.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.940
Now that's an amazing statement of God's Word, is it not?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.059
There's this new, Ronnie what's the new telescope called?

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:08.700
No, that's the old one.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.179
What is it?

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:11.700
James Webb?

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.780
Have any of you seen any of the images that have come back from that thing?

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.780
Amazing, right?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:26.020
And it's causing a lot of people to be like, oh, maybe what we thought isn't really true.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.619
A lot of scientists that believe the Big Bang all of a sudden are thinking, hmm.

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:33.059
It's phenomenal.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:38.539
And here our God says that He telleth the number of the stars, He calleth them all by

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:40.179
their names.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:50.140
Look at verse 5, great is our Lord and of great power, His understanding is infinite.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.419
Now none of us have understanding that is infinite, amen?

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:59.979
Certainly in a room of any number of people there will be individuals that have a greater

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:04.619
capacity of understanding than others within the room, right?

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:07.539
We understand that from an intellectual perspective.

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:12.579
But the reality is that not one of us have understanding that is infinite.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.299
Our God transcends us.

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:19.319
And so we seek to explain the Trinity and the doctrine of the Trinity.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:25.939
It is a task that we look to the Word of God and we accept by faith what God's Word says.

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:29.939
Let me say this, perhaps at some point in your Christian life you've heard some people

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:35.219
give some analogies and some illustrations as they've sought to explain the Trinity.

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:41.339
And I would say it this way, no illustration or no example that I know, it even comes close

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:46.279
to really giving the fullness of the Trinity.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:51.679
And so we can try in our feeble minds, we can try to seek to explain it, but the reality

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:55.919
is that we accept by faith what God said.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:11:01.139
And notice as we think about the term Trinity and we think about this teaching, Trinity

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:04.579
is not a word that you're going to find in the Bible.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:08.119
The English word Trinity or triunity, you're not going to find it the same way you don't

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:09.399
find the word rapture.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.919
And here's what some people want to attack.

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:13.439
Well, they don't believe in a rapture because they don't see the word rapture.

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.239
Well, the idea of a rapture is certainly there.

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:20.079
They shall be caught up together with Him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.039
The idea, the teaching of a rapture is there.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:25.279
Well, the same is true of the Trinity, but there are some that would attack and say,

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:28.399
the word's not even in the Bible and yet you teach the Trinity.

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.559
Well, the concept, the truth is obviously there.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.859
These three are one, triunity.

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:40.719
Even though the word Trinity or triunity isn't there, the truth is obvious.

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:49.559
And so we think about the term Trinity, it is God is revealed in three distinct persons.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:53.399
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.519
We've used the word triunity.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:12:00.079
You see in the Word of God the phrase, the Godhead.

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:02.839
You'll see that in Acts 17 and verse number 29.

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:07.639
And we find that as we begin to understand the Trinity, as we begin to look at the Word

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:12.199
of God and understand that God is revealed in three distinct persons, what they will

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:16.519
seek to attack when we speak about the Trinity is that you have three gods.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.319
No, we don't have three gods.

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:23.079
We have one God, three distinct persons.

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:27.399
And the reality is that as we look at the Word of God and we take and we, again, just

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:33.679
take what God has told us in His Word, we can see where God has revealed this to us.

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:37.799
We find that when we think of the Trinity, we think of this teaching, this understanding

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:47.359
that God is co-eternal in being, and co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and in glory.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.719
Jesus was not created.

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:53.359
He always has been, okay?

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:54.519
He's God.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.959
The Holy Ghost was not created.

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.519
He always has been.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.519
He's God.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:05.279
And so as we begin to understand the truth of the Word of God, we come to the first page

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:09.639
of the Bible, Genesis 1 and verse number 1.

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:16.639
And the Bible tells us as we read the Word of God, in the beginning, God created the

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.799
heaven and the earth.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.399
Now we understand this is not the beginning of eternity.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:26.719
We understand this is the beginning of creation, as God would give us a record of the creative

00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:29.759
work that He did here in the book of Genesis.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:33.879
And we find that He says in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:38.279
We've often said that God does not seek to prove His existence.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:40.919
He simply declares that He exists.

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:46.319
In fact, the name Jehovah means self-existent one.

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:47.999
And that's the God that we serve.

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:51.759
But here, when the Bible says in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, it's

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:54.079
not the word Jehovah.

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:59.279
The Hebrew word that is used here in Genesis 1 and verse number 1 for God is a word that

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:03.159
is used regularly throughout the Old Testament referring to God.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:06.319
It's the word Elohim.

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:12.139
We think about the word Elohim, we find that here, this truth that is given to us with

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:15.159
regard to Elohim, the strong one.

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:23.239
It's very interesting because Elohim is a plural noun, but here the verb is singular.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:29.359
And again, revealing to us this truth, this teaching, this concept, if you will, of God

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:34.139
being revealed in three distinct persons.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.319
And we find that it's quite interesting.

00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:37.719
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will.

00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:40.519
We'll be back to Genesis here in just a moment, but turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:41.519
will, in chapter number 6.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:46.639
Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 4 is a very familiar verse of Scripture, especially amongst

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.619
the people of Israel, the children of Israel.

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:55.519
This is a verse, a portion of Scripture that would have been very familiar to them, especially

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:59.279
the fourth verse here, Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 4.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:05.519
In Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 4, the Bible says, Here, O Israel, the LORD our God is

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:06.519
one LORD.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:11.759
Now, you see LORD twice in that verse of Scripture, and it's all caps, right?

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:14.079
And your Bible's all caps, and so what does that teach us?

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.319
It reveals to us it's speaking of Jehovah, right?

00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:25.399
And so the LORD Jehovah, our God, Elohim, is one Jehovah.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:31.359
And again, we're seeing that plural aspect with the singular.

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:32.719
And what is God revealing to us?

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:38.599
Again, He's revealing to us this truth of the Trinity that God is revealed in three

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:42.639
distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:47.079
And we see that as we study the Word of God, that this truth or this teaching of the Trinity

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.279
is really revealed to us even in the Old Testament.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:53.979
We find the fullness as we read the entirety of the Word of God, of course, and compare

00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:55.359
Scripture with Scripture.

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:57.639
But notice in Genesis, I said that we'd be back there.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:03.719
In Genesis chapter number 1, I want you to notice as we go through the days of creation,

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:07.039
how that the Trinity is revealed here in the Old Testament.

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:11.799
I'll give you three examples of the Trinity being revealed in the Old Testament.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:17.899
In Genesis 1, in verse number 26, we find that God is going to reveal to us the creation

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:19.579
of man.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:22.999
So the first example of the Trinity being revealed in the Old Testament is with regard

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:24.519
to the creation of man.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:34.759
The Bible says this in verse number 26, and God said, let us, God said, let us make man

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:39.999
in our image after our likeness, and let them, the man that He's going to create, let them

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.519
have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:47.319
and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:51.679
So God created man in His own image.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:56.719
In the image of God created He Him, male and female created He them.

00:16:56.719 --> 00:17:02.319
And so we find that even here in creation, when we speak about the creation of man, Adam

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:07.359
of course, we find here that it says, let us make man in our image.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.379
Again, it's not a polytheistic view.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:15.479
We understand the truth of the Trinity, that there's one God revealed in three distinct

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:17.039
persons.

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:22.039
Notice again in Genesis chapter 11, you skip forward several chapters and you find what's

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:27.719
taking place here in Genesis chapter 11, the Tower of Babel, and we find that here, not

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:33.519
only do we see it in the creation of man, but now also in the confounding of the languages

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:36.079
here in Genesis chapter 11.

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:39.079
Begin reading with me in verse number 5.

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:43.559
And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.839
And the Lord said, behold, the people is one, and they have all one language, and this they

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:48.159
begin to do.

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:51.839
And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

00:17:51.839 --> 00:18:01.439
Go to, let us, let us go down, and there confound their language that they may not understand

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:03.479
one another's speech, verse 8.

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:07.759
So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth, and they left

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:09.519
off to build the city.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:14.399
You find that in verse number 5, when you read when it says, and the Lord came down,

00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:18.879
verse number 6, and the Lord said, in verse number 8, so the Lord scattered, it's all

00:18:18.879 --> 00:18:20.439
Jehovah.

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:25.959
And we come there to verse number 7, he says, go to, let us go down, again, revealing to

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:32.959
us even in the opening pages of the Word of God, this truth of the Trinity.

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:36.599
Think about the call of Isaiah, turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:40.679
The third illustration we'll look at this evening is that of the call of Isaiah.

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:44.119
And by the way, when we look at Isaiah chapter number 6, there's many things that we could

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:51.760
rejoice in there in Isaiah 6 and be not, as we, as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.320
that we understand the importance of being in that same position of Isaiah, seeing God

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.479
in His rightful place, high, holy, and lifted up, and the Bible says that His train did

00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:04.479
fill the temple.

00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:08.839
I'm so thankful that we serve the God of the universe.

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:12.719
And when we look at Isaiah chapter number 6, it tells us, it sets the timing for us,

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:16.159
this is in the year that King Uzziah died, and there's some things that we know about

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:22.159
King Uzziah, we're aware of some things as we study his life, but when we see that this

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:30.959
really life-altering, if you will, nation-altering event takes place, that the king has died,

00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:38.119
that the Bible says that Isaiah's giving his testimony, he says, I saw also the Lord sitting

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:43.719
upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.

00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:47.959
The Bible says that he speaks of the angels that he saw there in verse number 2, above

00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:52.399
it stood the seraphims, each one had six wings, with twain he covered his face, with twain

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:57.599
he covered his feet, with twain he did fly, and one cried unto another and said, holy,

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.959
holy, holy.

00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:01.799
He is the Lord of hosts.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:06.219
The whole earth is full of His glory."

00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:08.599
Aren't you thankful that God is holy?

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:11.759
He's not becoming holy. He is holy.

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:14.119
The psalmist said that we are to give thanks

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:16.999
at the remembrance of His holiness.

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:19.779
We ought to rejoice that our God is holy.

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:21.319
And we rejoice in the fact,

00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:22.479
the nature of our God,

00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:23.839
that He is a holy God,

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:25.379
but we're also mindful that

00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:28.579
this thrice holy God that He has given to us

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:30.979
as people, we read it in the book of Leviticus,

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:32.979
but we also read it in the book of 1 Peter,

00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:34.639
that we are to be holy.

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:37.059
Why? Because our God is holy.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:40.739
And we're to be holy in all manner of conversation,

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.439
according to 1 Peter.

00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:44.759
And what a great truth.

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:47.059
And we see the seraphims there,

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.059
the angels crying out,

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:50.579
holy, holy, holy.

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:52.179
Skip down, if you will,

00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:53.259
in verse number eight,

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:56.659
the Bible says as he's continuing to speak here,

00:20:56.739 --> 00:21:01.019
it says, also I heard the voice of the Lord.

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:02.439
And here's what he heard.

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:03.739
He heard the voice of the Lord saying,

00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:06.979
whom shall I send?

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:11.579
And who will go for us?

00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:16.259
Whom shall I send?

00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:20.179
Who will go for us?

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.419
You see the concept, the teaching,

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:24.859
the truth of the Trinity,

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:26.859
not only in the creation of man,

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.219
the confounding of the languages,

00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:31.379
but here, the call of Isaiah.

00:21:31.379 --> 00:21:33.299
And you find that Isaiah responds,

00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:34.859
and what a great response.

00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:39.019
Then said I, here am I, send me.

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:42.699
What a great response to the call that's been placed.

00:21:42.699 --> 00:21:47.459
There is, as Isaiah would record here in this great book,

00:21:47.459 --> 00:21:50.699
this, the call that God gave him,

00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:53.759
the call that God placed upon his life.

00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:55.399
And he volunteered, listen,

00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:58.039
the reality is that each and every one of us

00:21:58.039 --> 00:22:01.079
ought to be willing to say, here am I, send me.

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.439
Lord, use me.

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:06.519
Use me in any capacity that you'd like to use me.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.839
Because as I understand who he is,

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:11.799
when I get that proper view of who God is,

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:15.719
and I understand who I am in comparison to who God is,

00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:17.639
and God says, whom shall I send?

00:22:17.639 --> 00:22:19.079
Who will go for us?

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:22.599
That our response should be, I'll volunteer.

00:22:22.599 --> 00:22:23.799
Here am I.

00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:25.559
Lord, would you use me?

00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:27.119
Would you use me in some capacity?

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:30.599
See, someone said this, God's looking for availability

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.559
more than he's looking for ability.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.199
See, God is able to equip his people.

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:36.679
He's able to equip his servants.

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:38.419
You know, some of the most gifted people

00:22:38.419 --> 00:22:39.799
that I went to Bible college with

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:41.919
don't even go to church today.

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.599
Honestly, some of the most gifted people

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.839
that I went to Bible college with

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:48.399
don't even attend church regularly today.

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:51.079
That's sad, sad.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.719
God's looking for availability.

00:22:53.719 --> 00:22:55.319
Isaiah said, here am I.

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:56.559
Send me.

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.479
You know, the mission that God gave to Isaiah

00:22:58.479 --> 00:22:59.839
was not an easy mission.

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:04.479
He tells them to go preach to the people

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:06.319
and then tells them they're not gonna listen.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:07.479
Isn't that encouraging?

00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:13.479
It's kind of interesting what he said to Ezekiel.

00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:15.479
He said to Ezekiel, I'm sending you to the people

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:17.239
that speak your own language

00:23:17.239 --> 00:23:18.159
and they're not gonna listen to you,

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:20.479
but if I sent you to somebody else, they'd listen to you.

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:21.519
Isn't that amazing?

00:23:23.399 --> 00:23:26.479
And here we find that the truth of the Trinity

00:23:26.479 --> 00:23:29.599
is revealed when God says, whom shall I send?

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:31.799
Who will go for us?

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:34.599
So we see, when we think about and seek to explain

00:23:34.599 --> 00:23:37.359
this truth, this teaching of the Trinity,

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:38.599
we see it in the Old Testament.

00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:41.399
Notice that the truth is taught in the New Testament as well.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:43.559
The Trinity is taught in the New Testament.

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:48.039
Each distinct person of the Godhead is acknowledged as God.

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:49.799
Again, as I define Trinity,

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:51.879
God is revealed in three distinct persons,

00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:54.839
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Ghost.

00:23:54.839 --> 00:23:56.439
So notice as we go to the New Testament

00:23:56.439 --> 00:23:58.239
that each of those three persons,

00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:00.359
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:03.399
the three distinct persons, of course, one God,

00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:06.839
that they are each acknowledged as and called God.

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:10.759
Go to John 17, if you will, John chapter number 17.

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:13.119
And I want you to look at these verses of Scripture

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.039
and understand that as we look here

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:18.879
and begin to understand the truth of the Word of God

00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:23.079
and the oneness, that triunity that we

00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:26.399
have in the Word of God, three distinct persons,

00:24:26.399 --> 00:24:31.359
and we understand the roles in which they have.

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:34.879
They're co-equal, but they have distinct roles.

00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:36.959
And we find here in John chapter number 17,

00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:38.559
we come to this portion of Scripture,

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:42.439
and Jesus, of course, would soon go to the cross of Calvary.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.279
And it says, these words spake Jesus

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:46.119
and lifted up His eyes to heaven and said,

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.959
Father, the hour is come.

00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:52.279
Glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:53.879
There's much that could be said here.

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:56.199
Number one, the fact that He says the hour is come.

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:57.959
If you study throughout the book of John,

00:24:57.959 --> 00:24:59.639
beginning in the second chapter, you'll

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:01.479
find reference to the hour.

00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:02.879
And He says in the second chapter,

00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:06.279
mine hour is not yet come, the miracle of the marriage

00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:07.519
there at Cana.

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.999
And we find that throughout the Gospel of John,

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:11.999
you'll see reference to the hour.

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:13.519
And now He's saying the hour is come.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:17.159
Listen, the purpose for which Jesus came into the earth,

00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:20.479
the purpose in which He took upon Himself

00:25:20.479 --> 00:25:23.279
the form of a man, came in the likeness of man,

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:25.439
was so that He would go to the cross of Calvary

00:25:25.439 --> 00:25:28.519
to redeem His creation.

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:31.439
And we find that here He says the hour is come.

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.439
Notice in verse number two, as thou

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:36.239
hast given Him power over all flesh,

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:38.119
that He should give eternal life to as many

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.599
as thou hast given Him.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:42.039
And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:44.959
the only true God.

00:25:44.959 --> 00:25:49.239
Jesus is praying to the Father, and He calls Him God.

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:49.759
Why?

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:51.679
Because He is.

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:54.879
He says, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,

00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:57.599
He says, I have glorified Thee on the earth.

00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:02.159
I have finished the work which thou gavest Me to do.

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:06.639
And now, O Father, glorify thou Me with thine own self.

00:26:06.639 --> 00:26:09.119
Notice what He says, with the glory which

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:14.279
I had with Thee before the world was.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:17.079
You see the eternality of Christ.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.719
He says, I have finished the work.

00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:20.719
I have glorified Thee on the earth.

00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:23.039
I finished the work that You gave Me to do.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.599
It was so absolutely certain that Jesus

00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:27.219
was going to go to the cross of Calvary

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:30.319
and do what God had, what the task was,

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:32.599
what the work was there for redeeming mankind,

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:36.079
that He could speak of it, even though it had not taken place,

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.079
as already being fulfilled.

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:40.079
It's amazing.

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:42.639
We find that He says that He was going

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:45.359
to enjoy that glory that He had with the Father

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:47.319
before the world was.

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:51.039
So here, we find that Jesus would refer to God

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.839
as He's praying here.

00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:54.839
We often, many times, people will

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:56.879
use the term in speaking of the Lord's Prayer,

00:26:56.879 --> 00:26:59.399
and they're really speaking of the model prayer, not

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:00.279
the Lord's Prayer.

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:04.119
This here in John 17 is really the Lord's Prayer.

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:06.479
The model prayer that many people call the Lord's Prayer

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:09.679
is when the disciples say, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.799
When you pray, pray like this, our Father,

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:13.279
which art in heaven, hallowed be thy.

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.479
That's not the Lord's Prayer.

00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:16.039
That's the model prayer.

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:19.039
We find here that John 17 is giving us

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.199
the record of the Lord's Prayer, and He's praying.

00:27:21.199 --> 00:27:22.519
And it goes all the way through the chapter,

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:23.319
and you can read it.

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:25.319
It's very powerful, all that takes place here.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.959
But then we remember that when Jesus

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:29.639
is on the cross of Calvary, it's not here,

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:31.679
but in Matthew chapter 27, in verse 46,

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:34.219
if you want to jot it down, I'm not going to turn over there.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.199
But in Matthew 27, in verse number 46,

00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:37.879
Jesus is there on the cross, and He says,

00:27:37.879 --> 00:27:40.639
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani.

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:46.159
That is to say, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:48.319
Now, many times I've heard over the years

00:27:48.319 --> 00:27:50.959
where people were criticized, if Jesus is God,

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.199
why did He call the Father God?

00:27:54.199 --> 00:27:56.079
Well, the same way, the same reason

00:27:56.079 --> 00:28:00.399
the Father calls Jesus God, because they're both God.

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.839
There's no discrepancy for us.

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:04.839
In John chapter 1, in verse number 1,

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:08.159
we find that here in these passages we looked at,

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:11.359
the Father is referred to and acknowledged as being God.

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:12.919
But in John 1, in verse number 1,

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:16.879
down through verse number 4, in the beginning was the Word,

00:28:16.879 --> 00:28:20.239
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.799
It's very interesting to me, and this is a side note.

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:25.079
And as I've taught these lessons,

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:27.399
and I didn't say in every one of the lessons

00:28:27.399 --> 00:28:29.319
and preface it with the same statement,

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:32.359
but really the idea of answering many of these questions that

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.759
have been asked is not so much so

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:37.039
that we can go out there and win an argument.

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:39.519
My desire is really to never win arguments,

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:41.519
because if you win arguments and they still leave

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.319
and they're lost, you really haven't accomplished

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:46.399
a whole lot, but my real purpose is that we would be

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.839
settled and grounded in the faith,

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:50.679
that we would not be tossed to and fro

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.639
with every wind of doctrine.

00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:55.279
And listen, there's a lot of false teaching out there today,

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:57.919
and it is more available than it's ever been.

00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:00.859
Listen, let me tell you, the Watchtower Society,

00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:02.719
the Jehovah Witnesses, I'm just gonna call them out

00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:04.799
by name tonight, I don't do it very often,

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:07.839
but they attack the person of Jesus Christ.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:10.579
And let me just let you know tonight,

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:15.579
they have become more and more subtle about their attack.

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:17.759
The verbiage that they're using,

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.799
the way in which they try to, listen,

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:23.599
they're trying to manipulate, they're trying to deceive.

00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:26.879
And they'll use verbiage, and listen,

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:31.159
they have a powerhouse of production that they do

00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:33.199
of publications.

00:29:33.199 --> 00:29:35.479
Some of you, no doubt, have received publications

00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:38.839
at your house, somebody, Brian sent me an email

00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:41.439
with a picture of, they sent some literature to his house

00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:43.879
of resident of such and such address.

00:29:43.879 --> 00:29:47.319
Listen, they have some really nice material.

00:29:49.379 --> 00:29:52.079
Dean leaves it on my desk occasionally.

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:54.239
He says, look at what they're passing out nowadays.

00:29:54.239 --> 00:29:55.839
Seriously, he does, right?

00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:59.399
And they become more and more subtle,

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:00.399
but that's how the.

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:03.799
enemy is, right? The enemy is more subtle than any… What's it say there in Genesis

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:09.819
3? That the serpent is more subtle than any beast of the field, right? And so we find…

00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:14.879
But here, you know, I've been accused from a Jehovah Witness, I've been accused of

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:18.539
being polytheistic. I'll get to that at the end of the message, which needs to hurry

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:22.859
up and get here, but I'll get to that in just a few moments. The reality is that I've

00:30:22.859 --> 00:30:29.639
been accused of being polytheistic because of the truth of the Trinity. John 1 and verse

00:30:29.639 --> 00:30:32.879
number 1 in our Bible says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and

00:30:32.879 --> 00:30:39.119
the Word was God. In their Bible, it says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:49.599
was with God, and the Word was a God. That's more polytheistic than the Trinity. Now, again,

00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:54.479
I'm not trying to pick a fight. I'm not trying to win an argument. I just want us to be settled

00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:59.639
and ground in the faith, because they're going to try to twist and turn and manipulate,

00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:08.399
and we must understand the truth that God has given us in His Word. The convincing arguments,

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:13.999
the rationale that some will use, and they'll try to take you to some obscure passage, and

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:20.159
they'll try to intimidate you with what they know versus what you may not know. And we

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:25.159
just need to stand on the truth of the Word of God. Just stand on the truth. The same

00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:29.719
was in the beginning with God, verse 3, all things were made by Him. Without Him was not

00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:33.639
anything made that was made, and Him was life, and the life was the light of men, verse 14.

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:38.599
And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glories of

00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:44.759
the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. And how we should rejoice in understanding

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:51.679
this truth, that the Son, the Word was made flesh, the Word is Jesus Christ, and the Word

00:31:51.679 --> 00:32:00.079
is God. In Hebrews chapter number 1, Hebrews 1 is a quote from Psalm 45. In Hebrews chapter

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:05.639
number 1 in verses 8 and 9, we find that as you would look at Psalm 45 and understand

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:10.159
what's taking place here, it would be the Father that is speaking. And the Father is

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:14.639
speaking, and here it's recorded in Hebrews chapter number 1, in verse number 8, the Bible

00:32:14.639 --> 00:32:18.959
says, but unto the Son, He saith, and again, if you go back to Psalm 45, you'd understand

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:24.039
that He's speaking of the Father there. Here's what the Father says of the Son. Thy throne,

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:29.799
O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:34.799
righteousness and hated iniquity. Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed the oil of

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:40.759
gladness above thy fellows. And so we find that here, the Son is called God. Why? Because

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:47.039
He is. So people say, why did Jesus call the Father God? Well, the same reason the

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:52.159
Father called Jesus God, because they're both God. The Holy Spirit, we looked at this last

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:57.119
week, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it, but in Acts 5, in verses 3 and 4, with

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:02.959
the situation there with Ananias and Sapphira, and Peter is given insight here. The Holy

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:09.079
Spirit gives truth to Peter with regard to the portion that was kept back, and they bring

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:13.839
these things to the apostles' feet, and they act as if they had given everything. And we

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:20.039
find that Peter says to Ananias in verse 3 of Acts 5, why hath Satan filled thine heart

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:25.039
to lie to the Holy Ghost? And then in verse 4, at the end of the verse, he says, thou

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:31.439
hast not lied unto men, but unto God. There's no discrepancy between verse 3 and 4. There's

00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:35.719
a complete understanding by Peter as he would be speaking, of course, under the inspiration

00:33:35.719 --> 00:33:39.439
of the Holy Spirit of God as it's scripture and recorded for us, but there's obvious

00:33:39.439 --> 00:33:42.359
acknowledgment here that the Holy Spirit is God.

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:45.999
And so we begin to think about the Trinity being taught in the New Testament. We understand

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:49.959
that each person of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are acknowledged

00:33:49.959 --> 00:33:54.919
and referred to as being God. Think about the instruction that we receive in Matthew

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:59.659
chapter 28 with regard to the gospel and with regard to baptism, the Great Commission as

00:33:59.659 --> 00:34:04.039
we often refer to it as. We find that there in Matthew chapter 28, beginning in verse

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:09.479
number 18, Jesus, after His ascension, the Bible tells us that they went there and they

00:34:09.479 --> 00:34:14.359
worshiped Him, and it tells us in verse number 18 that Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,

00:34:14.359 --> 00:34:19.079
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:22.759
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:29.399
And so again, you see the three distinct persons of the Godhead that are referenced here, teaching

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:33.279
them, verse 20, to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you

00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:39.399
always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. And you can jot down, if you want, 2 Corinthians

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:45.359
chapter 13 and verse number 14. And in that verse of Scripture, it's often been referred

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:50.199
to as the apostolic benediction. The Bible says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:55.639
the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen. And again,

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:01.279
you see this teaching of the Trinity. Now, let me say this very quickly in closing.

00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:09.119
The Trinity is not bold, highlight, underscore. The teaching, the truth, the biblical teaching

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:17.039
of the Trinity is not polytheism. It is not. And that will be an accusation that will be

00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:24.439
cast against you, is that you're polytheistic. We are not polytheistic. There is one God

00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:32.079
revealed, manifested in three distinct persons. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:37.479
so we find, when we think about polytheism, of course we would be familiar with Hinduism.

00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:42.159
Not that Hinduism is the only polytheistic religion. Obviously there are many polytheistic

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:48.599
religions. But when you think about polytheism, they do not believe, they do not teach that

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:53.439
their God is one. They have many gods. And in fact, within their gods, now some of them

00:35:53.439 --> 00:35:57.599
say, no, I only believe in one God. But when you begin to study and dig in, you'll find

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:01.119
that their gods have the ability to fight one against another. They have the ability

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:05.839
to create other gods. They have the ability to destroy other gods, and so on and so forth.

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:10.399
But yet when we find, when we look at the truth of the Word of God, when you think about

00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:16.199
how God has revealed Himself to us and given us this truth of the Trinity or the triunity,

00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:21.159
there is absolute unity. There's unity.

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:28.159
The second thought is this, that polytheism would teach that God can be manifest in a

00:36:28.159 --> 00:36:35.039
multitude of ways. And that's why when you think about a polytheistic culture or religion,

00:36:35.039 --> 00:36:39.599
oftentimes they have absolutely no problem accepting Jesus. Now, not that Jesus is the

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:44.119
Bible, but they have no problem putting Jesus on the shelf with all the other gods that

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:48.879
they would serve when you think about polytheism. And when you begin to think about that polytheistic

00:36:48.879 --> 00:36:54.959
perspective, there's so many different things that could be God, because God can be manifest

00:36:54.959 --> 00:37:00.399
in a multitude of ways. However, the Bible clearly teaches us that God is manifest through

00:37:00.399 --> 00:37:04.119
Jesus Christ. Right?

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:09.799
Let me just read this verse in Colossians 2, in verse number 9. In Colossians 2, in

00:37:09.959 --> 00:37:13.239
verse number 9, the Bible says this,

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:20.239
For in Him, speaking of Christ, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:30.279
Polytheism would also teach that there are various or different levels of deity. In fact,

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:35.639
they would teach that the most powerful gods are the ones that are closest to the temple

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:39.559
guarding it. And the further you get away, the less power they have, and so on and so

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:45.919
forth. But our Bible reveals God to us, and we understand the Trinity teaches that God

00:37:45.919 --> 00:37:51.279
exists in three persons and is co-equal in power and in glory.

00:37:51.279 --> 00:37:55.439
Begin to think about creation. And we don't have time to go through all of these examples.

00:37:55.439 --> 00:38:00.399
I'll just use the example of creation. You look at the truth of creation. The Lord declares

00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:04.679
in the Old Testament that He created all things. And then Jesus declares in the New Testament

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:10.519
that He created all things. We read John 1 already. There's no discrepancy for us. Why?

00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:16.959
Because He's God. He's God. It's very interesting, and again, I'm not seeking to try to provide

00:38:16.959 --> 00:38:23.439
some level of analogy or illustration that would help us to understand the truth or the

00:38:23.439 --> 00:38:27.559
concept of the Trinity, because I think every illustration that we could give, and I've

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:31.719
heard a number of them. In fact, I've used some of them in the past. I will not use any

00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:35.359
of them this evening. But I do want you to think about the universe.

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:42.359
I want you to finish up by looking at Psalm 19. It's very interesting, this thought that

00:38:42.359 --> 00:38:47.399
we have here in Psalm 19. Again, it's a familiar passage of Scripture for us. We find that

00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:53.679
God, of course, created all things. He's the creator of all things. We find that His creation

00:38:53.679 --> 00:39:00.619
reveals His person, right? And we look at the universe, and we find that the Bible tells

00:39:00.619 --> 00:39:08.539
us in Psalm 19, the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:12.199
And we begin to think about the beginning of this portion of Scripture and speaking

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:16.179
about how the heavens declare the glory of God. When we think about the universe, it's

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:20.579
space, time, and matter. If you remove any of them, it's no longer a universe.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:25.979
We begin to think about the way in which the heavens declare the glory of God, and there's

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:30.859
a great connection there with regard to this teaching, this understanding, this biblical

00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:36.979
truth with regard to the Trinity. And so, again, we begin to understand the teaching

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:40.219
of the Trinity. It's obvious throughout the Word of God. We see it in the Old Testament,

00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:45.259
we see it in the New Testament, and the Bible says plainly in 1 John 5, in verse number

00:39:45.259 --> 00:39:49.899
7, the verse that we started out with this evening, the Bible says very plainly, and

00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:54.379
we accept it by faith, that there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the

00:39:54.379 --> 00:40:00.299
Lord, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. It's not that these three agree

00:40:00.299 --> 00:40:06.219
in one, that's how they'll try to change some things, but these three are one, the triunity.

00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:12.539
And just as Augustine said, as I started out the message this evening, I am not going to

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:21.539
try to limit an infinite God to my finite understanding, but I accept and believe by

00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:28.099
faith what the Word of God teaches with regard to the subject of the Trinity. And the Trinity

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:35.339
is critical. It is critical. Because if you leave the teaching of the Trinity, if you

00:40:35.339 --> 00:40:41.699
deny the fact that Jesus is God, then you serve a Jesus that is not the Jesus of the

00:40:41.699 --> 00:40:50.659
Bible, and there is no salvation outside of the Jesus of the Bible, God in flesh. Amen?

00:40:50.659 --> 00:40:55.259
So I'm thankful for the truth of the Trinity, and I hope this evening that we would have

00:40:55.259 --> 00:41:01.179
an ability to be more just settled and grounded. Many other things that I said along the way

00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:05.659
as we looked at some of those passages, and I trust that God would use His Word in the

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:09.059
hearts of His people as only He can. Let's pray together.

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:12.899
Father, we do love You, and we thank You so much for loving us. We thank You that You

00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:21.259
are a great God and that You have revealed Yourself to us. You transcend us. You're infinite.

00:41:22.259 --> 00:41:29.579
And yet You've given us this Bible, and as we study the Word of God, You reveal Your

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:40.379
nature and Your character, Your purpose, Your plan. God, we stand in awe of who You are.

00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:48.739
And then we just wonder why You would love us so, save us, redeem us, and then to think

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:57.599
that You would use us. God, I pray that we'd be willing, as Isaiah was, to serve You.

00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:05.739
You are worthy of our service. Even when it's revealed that the job that I have for You,

00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:11.579
the people will not listen, You, God, are still worthy of our service. We don't serve

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:16.419
You for the results. We don't serve You for the blessings. We serve You because You're

00:42:16.419 --> 00:42:26.259
worthy. God, I pray that You'd help us to stand fast. Lord, to be settled and grounded.

00:42:26.259 --> 00:42:32.619
I pray that tonight we as Your people would rejoice in Thee. I pray that in this moment

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:36.899
of invitation that You would encourage our hearts and strengthen us. We'll thank You

00:42:36.899 --> 00:42:39.019
for it. In Christ's name we pray.
