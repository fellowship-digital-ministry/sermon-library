00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.159
Proverbs, chapter number 15, verse number 1 is our text this evening.

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:29.360
I've titled the message, The Power of Our Words, The Power of Our Words, Proverbs 15

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
verse number 1.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.880
The Bible says this, a soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.360
It's amazing for me and I think for you as well to think about the power of our words.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.639
We can use our words to build up in a positive manner or we can use our words to bring low

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:56.240
in a negative manner.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.319
I think about the positive use of our words to give compliment, to give thanks, to encourage.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.680
We can do all of that with our words.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.080
It's pretty amazing what we can do with our words, how we can encourage someone, how we

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.480
can compliment someone, how we can give thanks, of course, to our God supremely, but also

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
to one another.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.959
And we think about that being used in a positive fashion, but we do understand that our words

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.480
can be used in a negative connotation as well.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.199
We can criticize, complain, attack.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.000
You know, God hears us, all of our words.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He hears us.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.360
It's interesting if you were to study in the Old Testament, especially in the book of Numbers,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.160
you'll find the people complaining regularly, the children of Israel.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.760
The Bible will say often how that God heard their complaint.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760
He heard their words.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.040
I think about the positive and the negative aspect of our words and I think about this

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.279
single verse of Scripture here in Proverbs 15 and verse number 1, and what a great contrast

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.019
that we see here in this verse of Scripture.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:03.919
The Bible says a soft answer.

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:10.279
Notice the thought there, a soft answer, something that is tender or delicate, the answer being

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.279
the response.

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:19.320
And no doubt we can understand how our words can have that tender or delicate answer that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.440
we would provide a response to someone and we find that the Bible says that a soft answer

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.759
turneth away wrath.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.759
That's powerful.

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.960
That's powerful.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:42.039
A soft answer, tender, delicate response, the Bible says turneth away wrath.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:50.679
Not sharp, not harsh, but tender, delicate.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:51.679
Notice the contrast.

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:59.600
The Bible says, but grievous words, grievous words, those are hurtful or painful, that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.720
which would cause grief or sorrow, that which is provoking or offensive, that's what grievous

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
means.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.960
And those grievous words, notice what the Bible says, they stir up anger.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.000
It's interesting because we see a turning away of wrath and we see a stirring up of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.399
anger.

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:32.399
It is the soft answer that turneth away wrath, but it is the grievous words that stir up

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:33.399
anger.

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:40.080
Have you ever heard someone use the expression that they're just adding fuel to the fire?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.679
You've heard someone use that expression before?

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:49.320
You've understood no doubt in your life and I know in my life we absolutely have understood

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.360
the power of our words.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.600
Consider with me the counsel that we see in Proverbs 4 and verse number 24, and you don't

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.639
need to turn to all these verses, I'm going to try to go quickly this evening, it's already

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.639
10 till.

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:08.720
In Proverbs 4 and verse number 24 the Bible says this, put away from thee a froward mouth

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.160
and perverse lips put far from thee.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.720
That's good counsel.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.920
To put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.679
I consider the counsel from Proverbs 4 and verse 24, I consider the truth that God gives

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:32.399
us in Proverbs 18 and verse number 21, where there the Bible says this, death and life

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:35.359
are in the power of the tongue.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.679
They that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:39.119
Did you hear that?

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:44.040
Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.279
Wow.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:52.679
The observation that is given to us in Proverbs 21 and verse 23, where the Bible says, whoso

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.200
keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:02.760
Proverbs 21, 23.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.799
Some of us need to memorize that verse of Scripture, amen?

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:06.799
Seriously.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:07.799
Proverbs 21 and verse 23.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:14.799
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:22.119
I'm sure that on more than one occasion or on more occasions than we'd like to admit,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.160
our words have caused us trouble.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.760
Amen?

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.959
More often than we'd like to admit, our words have caused us trouble.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:37.320
And here we find that the Bible says, whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.160
soul from troubles.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.440
Have you ever had a situation and say, man, I wish I didn't say that?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.880
You're trying to catch your words as they're leaving your mouth, but guess what?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.119
You can't do that.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:54.959
I remember this expression, and we spoke, obviously, today is Mother's Day.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:59.359
This morning, the truth from Proverbs 31, my mother taught me.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:04.079
I remember hearing this often from my mom as I was growing up, and as you know, I didn't

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:05.399
get saved until I was a senior in high school.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:10.160
My parents didn't get saved until I was, I think, eighth grade when they got saved.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.119
And so as a young kid, I would hear, not from a biblical perspective, but just from a moral

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:21.480
perspective, if you don't have anything nice to say, tell me what it says.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.640
Don't say anything at all, right?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.399
You've heard that, no doubt, right?

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.519
And I remember hearing that from my mom at a young age.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:33.720
I also remember hearing this, think before you speak.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.760
Think before you speak.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.279
Now sometimes we have a problem with that.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.399
Because sometimes we just, I mean, our mouth just kind of, I mean, it just rolls, right?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.959
Sometimes something happens in life, something is going on, someone says something to us.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:50.279
You think about that truth of Proverbs 15 and verse number one, where the Bible says,

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:53.920
a soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.959
There are times in your life and in my life when someone has said something to us and

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:05.000
we respond not with a soft answer, but with grievous words, and all of a sudden, wrath

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.519
is stirred up.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.640
Anger is stirred up.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.480
We find here that as we think about the power of our words this evening, and I think about

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.160
those two statements that I often remember my mom sharing with me throughout the years,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.239
I would think of this, that some have put this idea of think before you speak to an

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:30.799
acronym, THINK, T-H-I-N-K.

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:34.040
And in eight minutes, I'm going to try to get through it, amen?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.920
And you guys like to fellowship anyway, so I'll preach a little bit longer tonight, amen?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.239
But no, honestly, let me just try to get through this, T. Here's some questions to

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:47.119
ask ourselves when we are going to use our words, because we understand the power of

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:51.959
our words, and we think about this, and we're going to use this acronym THINK.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.579
Number one, the T, is it truthful?

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:56.579
Is it truthful?

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:02.959
In Ephesians 4 and verse number 15, we are instructed to speak the truth in love, to

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.519
speak the truth in love.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:08.640
Now we think about that, that verse of Scripture and the admonition that is given to us that

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.040
we are to speak the truth, and so we must ensure that what we are saying is truthful,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.160
but God says that we're to speak the truth in love, in love.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.000
So there's a way in which we have to speak the truth, and that is in love.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Think about this, in the book of Zechariah, the Old Testament prophet, I want you to notice

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.320
what Zechariah says in Zechariah 8 and verse number 16.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.599
The Bible says this, these are the things that ye shall do, speak every man the truth

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:43.880
to his neighbor, execute the judgment of truth, and peace in your gates.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.559
And what a difference a society would be if every man spoke truth to his neighbor.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:54.799
Honestly, it would be a different society altogether.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:09:00.159
Zechariah 8 and verse 16 tells us, of course, the passage continues with other things that

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:04.200
we ought to do, but the first one that is mentioned there is that we're to speak every

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.979
man the truth to his neighbor.

00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:08.979
Is it truthful?

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:11.440
Let's say this, is it helpful?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440
Is it helpful?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.640
Ephesians chapter number 4 and verse number 29, the Bible tells us how we can use our

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.599
words, and I've already mentioned that we can use them in a positive fashion, also in

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:27.419
a negative fashion, but we find that in Ephesians 4 and verse number 29, the Bible says there

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:31.559
that we're to let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:38.719
But notice what it says, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it, those

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:45.880
words that we speak, that they may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880
So are our words helpful?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.960
Have you ever been in a situation where maybe you were thinking before you spoke and there

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
was something that came to your mind to say and you said, you know, that's probably not

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
very helpful in this circumstance.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
It's not very helpful in this situation for me to speak.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.260
this thing. And we find that it is to be used, notice, for the use of edifying.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.659
The word edify is such an important word for us to understand as we read through

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:13.460
the New Testament. We see so often that God uses that word

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.620
and how we're to build up one another. I mentioned already by way of introduction

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.819
that we can use our words in a positive manner to build up

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:24.860
or we can use them in the negative to bring low.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.540
Oh, that God would help us to use our words to build people up, to

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.659
edify them. We find that the Bible teaches us in the book of Psalms,

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:39.819
in Psalm 37 and verse number 30, with regard to this thought of whether it's helpful.

00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:44.500
In Psalm 37 and verse number 30, the psalmist says this,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.740
speaking of the righteous man, that the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:56.619
and his tongue talketh of judgment. It's interesting because verse number 31

00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:01.540
gives us the key as to why he speaks wisdom and he talks of judgment,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.739
and that is because the law of his God is in his heart.

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:09.819
None of his steps shall slide. And the more time we spend in God's word,

00:11:09.819 --> 00:11:13.260
the more of God's word that's going to come out of our mouth.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.940
We're going to be able to use God's word. Listen, I believe this evening that God's

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.699
word is helpful. It's profitable.

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:23.819
We understand that. And so we ask ourselves, is this thing truthful?

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:28.620
Is it helpful? I could ask it this way, is it inspiring?

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.900
The I, T-H-I, number three there, is it inspiring?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.699
And we're there in Psalm 37, look over in chapter 35, and notice in verse number 28,

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:41.019
Psalm 35 and verse number 28, the Bible says,

00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:47.419
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:51.300
I want you to think about the psalmist and the manner in which you would use his words.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.379
And he says that my tongue shall speak, and of course of God,

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:58.660
of God's righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.819
That's inspiring. You're going to hear somebody, listen,

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:05.900
I don't like hearing people complain. How many of you like listening to people complain?

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.259
I cannot stand listening to people complain. I want to be honest with you.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:14.220
I don't think God likes listening to us complain. He says it in his word over and over.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.419
He doesn't like complaining. But you know what we're good at as human beings?

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:22.740
Complaining. We really are. We're good at it.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.779
We find here that we think about this thought of inspiring one another.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.419
And if somebody is speaking like the psalmist says here,

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:33.899
that he's speaking of the righteousness of God and praising God all the day long,

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.539
that's inspiring. And guess what?

00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:38.460
All of a sudden that's inspiring me to think about my Savior,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.619
to think about my God and to praise him along with the brother or sister that is praising the Lord.

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:48.740
Psalm 77 and verse number 12 says it this way,

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.179
I will meditate also of all thy work and talk of all thy doings.

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:58.460
You know it's inspiring when someone talks about what God is doing.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.979
It really is. We can talk about what God has done in the past

00:13:02.979 --> 00:13:06.979
and the works that he's done that are contained within the pages of this precious book.

00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:10.339
But we can also talk about what God is doing in our life actively.

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:14.339
We begin to talk about God's doings, God's workings in our lives.

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:19.779
And that's inspiring to people. It's encouraging.

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:25.580
The end, is it necessary? Is it necessary? Is it necessary?

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:33.380
Let me share a few verses with you in the book of Proverbs chapter 11 and verse number 12.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.419
Some people may have a perspective that, well, it was necessary for me to say that, okay?

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:43.740
Let's take everything else into consideration with regard to these biblical truths

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.740
of speaking the truth in love.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.979
And I want you to think about this as we notice these few verses in the book of Proverbs

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:53.979
with whether or not something is necessary for us to speak.

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:56.820
Notice in Proverbs 11 and verse number 12, the Bible says,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.139
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:05.059
But of man of understanding, notice what it says, holdeth his peace.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:08.660
You ever hear somebody say, I'm going to give him peace of my mind?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.779
I always laugh. It's probably going to be the last peace of your mind, right?

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:17.540
I mean, you better be careful when you're giving somebody a peace of your mind.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.339
Typically, what follows when somebody says, I'm going to give you a peace of my mind,

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:25.299
is not necessary. It's something that's not inspiring.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:28.420
It's something that's not helpful. Amen?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.619
I've had people say that to me. Let me give you a peace of my mind.

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:34.299
And I already know what's coming.

00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:40.820
Notice in Proverbs 15, it says here that he that holdeth, a man of understanding holdeth his peace.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.500
Let's look over at chapter 15 and verse number 23.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.339
Proverbs 15 and verse number 23, the Bible says,

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:58.420
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth in a word spoken, notice this phrase, in due season.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.540
How good is it?

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:09.420
I don't always know what the due season is, but the Holy Spirit does.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.380
I don't always know, but the Holy Spirit does.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.500
And as I'm abiding in the Spirit, as I'm walking in the Spirit,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.260
not fulfilling the lust of the flesh, as I'm seeking to follow the Lord,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.540
then something might be necessary to say, but it might not be the due season.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.339
Does that make sense this evening?

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:30.980
It might not be the right place. It might not be the right setting.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.299
And God, the Holy Spirit, communes with our spirit.

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:41.899
We can have that, you know, it's not really the right time to say that to that individual.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.700
That requires that we walk with God. It really does.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.660
That little phrase there, in due season, is impactful.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.059
Notice in Proverbs chapter 25 and verse number 11.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:16:00.179
In Proverbs 25 and verse number 11, going right along with this in due season from Proverbs 15 and verse 23,

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:08.220
here the Bible says this, a word, fitly spoken, is like apples of gold and pictures of silver.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.420
And think about that phrase, fitly spoken.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:16.100
You know what it means, really? It carries with it literally the idea, at the right moment.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.459
At the right moment. That's what it means, fitly spoken.

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:24.339
In due season, fitly spoken.

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:28.660
I want to say this, when I think about this thought of whether it is necessary.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:38.220
At times, what might be necessary to say is also difficult to say.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.579
Have you ever experienced that in your life?

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:48.380
It's necessary to say something, but it's a difficult something that you need to say.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.739
If you've not been in that position in life, I think one day you will be.

00:16:53.739 --> 00:17:02.179
I've been in that position many times, where I know that there's something that's necessary to say, but it's difficult.

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:04.260
It's not easy.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:11.260
And I would say that in moments like those, we must spend much time in prayer,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.140
and we must deliver the words in an appropriate manner.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.859
When the Bible says, speak the truth in love, we think about something that's necessary.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.940
See, sometimes correction is necessary, correct?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.899
I mean, we all need correction at times in our lives.

00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:34.980
And we would say, well, it's necessary that I correct that behavior.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:46.100
You're in a position that you would have the responsibility of correcting the behavior of giving that word, and it's necessary.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.739
It's difficult.

00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:54.459
You're in a situation where you had to talk to someone, and your stomach just bothered you.

00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:59.019
You're just, man, I wish I really didn't have to have this meeting.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:00.339
Have you ever been there?

00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:03.739
I've been there more times than I could tell you.

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:07.859
And in those moments, we've acknowledged it's necessary.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:09.179
It's going to be hard.

00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:10.339
It's necessary.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:17.779
And I would say that we must bathe it in prayer, and we must be careful to deliver the message in an appropriate manner.

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:23.100
Look over at what the book of Proverbs, here in chapter 27, just a couple of chapters from where we were in chapter 25.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:32.460
Notice in chapter 27, in verse number 6, notice what the Bible says.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.979
Speaking on our words, not which is necessary, but yet difficult.

00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:43.780
The Bible says, faithful are the wounds of a friend.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.460
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:54.859
As we're going to think about this verse of Scripture, and begin to consider this evening,

00:18:54.859 --> 00:19:02.780
this truth of what is necessary, and as I consider that which is necessary, but yet difficult at the same time,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.260
and I also understand the Bible says, faithful are the wounds of a friend.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.619
I preached a message a couple of weeks ago on Sunday evening that I entitled, Divisions and Contentions.

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:16.260
And in that message, I was speaking there from the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter number 1,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:23.140
and I mentioned that during times of conflict, there are some things that we must consider so that we would respond properly.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:29.700
And one of those was that we must review what we know to be true.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:37.580
When someone is a friend, I mean, I'm saying truly a biblical friend, the definition of a friend.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:44.179
The Bible says, iron sharpeneth iron, and the Bible says, faithful are the wounds of a friend.

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:51.780
I don't know this evening where you are in your life, but I would say this, that there comes a time in our lives

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:59.500
where there might be the need for a friend to deliver to us a message that is difficult.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:09.619
but necessary. Necessary, but difficult. And in those moments we must understand that the

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:17.840
Bible says faithful are the wounds of a friend. Now, I would not say that someone has the

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.639
liberty to use this verse of Scripture and violate other verses of Scripture that we've

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:28.020
already looked at and say, well, faithful are the wounds of a friend. That's not what

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:34.279
I'm suggesting this evening. But there are times that something is necessary to be said.

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:41.000
And my question at that time, and as we have to deal with it as adults in dealing with

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.680
someone, a friend coming and giving us something that's maybe challenging to receive, do we

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.880
have the humility? Do we understand that they love us and they have our best interest at

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:01.619
heart and at mind? I'll give you a simple, silly illustration. Have you ever heard somebody

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:07.959
public speak that says, um, all the time? Sure you have. Have you ever heard somebody

00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:15.660
that public speaks that says okay a lot? Okay, okay, okay. There's a professor at Bible

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.540
College, not the Bible College that I went to, but a fellow that I worked with after

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.879
I was, actually I was in Bible College at the time, and his professor said okay all

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:27.760
the time. And so he gathered some of the students together and he said, listen, next time he

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.800
says okay, here's what we're going to do. All the class together is going to say, okay,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:39.319
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's just say the professor wasn't very pleased with that,

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:46.099
okay? It was not well received. When I first started preaching, I would say okay quite

00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:52.019
a bit. It was just my thing. I just said okay. And it was almost like a, are you following,

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:57.339
are you tracking, are you where I am, that kind of a thing. And I was doing my internship

00:21:57.339 --> 00:22:02.019
at a church, and I was still in Bible College, and I had to, I had to preach a number of

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:06.339
messages during my internship, and a man in the church, Henry Barfield, he's with the

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:11.460
Lord now, and Henry Barfield came to me and he handed me two dollars worth of quarters.

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:19.860
He said, I want you to put these in your pocket, and I want you to jingle them around. Okay?

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:25.539
So I did it. He said, it's annoying, right? Yeah, actually it is. He said, every time

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:33.259
you say okay, that's what it sounds like. That's what he said to me. And he said, here's

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:38.740
what I want you to know. When I first started, now he wasn't a pastor, he was a, he was an

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:44.419
adult Sunday school teacher in a church for 25 years. Taught adult Sunday school. A deacon

00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:52.220
in a church, just a solid Christian. He said, when I first started teaching, I said um all

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.899
the time. And he said, somebody in the church gave me two dollars worth of quarters, so

00:22:56.899 --> 00:23:00.899
I'm going to put them in my pocket. Now I don't carry two dollars worth of quarters

00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:05.539
in my pocket, but that man, after teaching for all those years, every time he taught

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:12.539
he had quarters in his pocket. And that was his reminder to not say um. I don't have

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:15.779
to carry the quarters to not say okay, at least I think. I don't say it as often as

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:20.300
I used to, that's for sure. But the reality is that, listen, I could have been offended

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.179
by that. Could have been hurtful. But you know what, that man was just trying to help

00:23:25.179 --> 00:23:30.860
me. He was just trying to help me. He was just trying to be a blessing. And it's a silly

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.779
illustration, some simple kind of thing, but nonetheless we find this evening that

00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:42.380
there are times in which we have a message to deliver to somebody that's necessary, but

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:49.779
difficult. And in those times we need the help of God. And we need God's help to be

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:58.699
able to deliver that message. And when that message is delivered, my response is so vital.

00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:08.139
Why? Because a soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger. Number five,

00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:16.220
if I count it right, K, is it kind? Is it kind? How many of you heard little kids running

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:24.500
around and you heard parents say, speak kindly, use kind words. We ask ourselves, is it kind?

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.700
Look over at the book of Ephesians. We've already referenced three verses from Ephesians

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.260
chapter number four, or excuse me, this is the third verse from Ephesians chapter number

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:39.420
four. Notice in chapter four in verse number 32, we find that he said in verse number 15

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.420
that we're to speak the truth in love. We find in verse number 29 that our words are

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.339
to be used for the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And then

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:52.779
here in verse number 32 the Bible says, and be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving

00:24:52.779 --> 00:25:00.940
one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Be kind. Notice Colossians

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.299
chapter number four, and we'll finish with this verse of scripture. In Colossians four

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:10.980
in verse number six, it's a familiar verse. In fact, at the, I believe it was the last

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:17.260
Sunday of 2022, so just five months ago or so, I preached a message from this portion

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.579
of scripture, Colossians four, verse five and six. And I don't remember exactly what

00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:25.459
I titled the message, something with regard to having a successful year, that sort of

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:30.980
thing. And I talked about walking in wisdom toward them that are without and redeeming

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.940
the time. And then I talked about this in verse number six, let your speech, notice

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:46.700
those words, these are difficult words, be always with grace. That little word in Colossians

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.619
four in verse number six where it says, always, that's an important word. It's a difficult

00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:57.459
word. You know why? Sometimes we just don't feel like it. Sometimes our flesh wants to

00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:03.459
just say something. You have the flesh just like I do. We all have the flesh. We're to

00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:09.380
mortify our members, we're to crucify our flesh. But you know, it's very amazing to

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.140
me how quickly our flesh can come alive. Have you ever experienced that? I mean, you're

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.940
walking in the spirit, you're just rejoicing in the Lord and then something happens and

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:24.500
all of a sudden it's like, man, what happened? I was trying to rent a piece of machinery

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.220
probably ten years ago for the church and I was in the place of business trying to rent

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.859
a piece of machinery to do some work here at the church and the owner of that establishment

00:26:31.859 --> 00:26:41.540
just ripped me to pieces. I mean, just criticized me, he questioned my integrity, he questioned,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:49.019
I mean, he just was ugly nasty, just rude. You call yourself a preacher and you're trying

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:54.739
to get away with paying taxes. He was just going after me. All because I tried to give

00:26:54.739 --> 00:27:01.899
him a tax exempt form that is a state of Virginia form to not have to pay taxes for the piece

00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:07.579
of equipment that we're renting. You call yourself a preacher. I mean, he was going

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:12.459
after me. And here's all I could, the Holy Spirit just kept running around. I just, five

00:27:12.459 --> 00:27:17.059
minutes earlier I was just praying this, Lord help me to walk in the spirit today. Lord

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:24.260
help me not to give in to the flesh. Lord help me to walk in the spirit. And I pray

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:30.459
this, Lord help me to be dead to criticisms and to compliments. And it was real in that

00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:35.579
moment because I wanted to tell that guy a few things as well. I'm just being honest

00:27:35.579 --> 00:27:45.019
with you. I mean, he was questioning my integrity. It was, and I just stood there. I just stood

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:53.619
there. And he got done. And I very quietly, very kindly and politely, I said, sir, with

00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:59.140
all due respect, could you just read letter B of this form and let me know why this is

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.579
not, I don't mind paying the taxes, but can you just explain it to me? Ripped the paper

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:08.899
out of my hand, read it, threw it on the table, whatever, I won't charge you the taxes.

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:16.019
I mean, just ugly. But listen, sometimes that happens in our lives. But how do we respond

00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:22.899
to it? How do we respond to it? Talked about divisions and contentions a couple of weeks

00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:26.100
ago. You know, people sometimes respond to that kind of stuff today. They go to their

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:32.020
car and they get some kind of weapon and they do some bad stuff. No, no, no, no. That's

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:40.260
not how we respond. We have to be kind. A soft answer, turn it the way we're at. It's

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:48.700
a biblical promise. Grievous words stir up anger. This evening, our words are powerful.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:56.700
Our words are powerful. And if we're not careful, we don't take heed to the truth of

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:05.099
Proverbs 21 and verse 23. And our words, they cause us trouble, cause us trouble. I hope

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:14.500
this evening that God would help us to understand the power of our words to set a watch, a gate

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:21.099
before our mouth, that we would think before we speak. Say, God, I want to honor you with

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:29.380
my words. I want to build people up with my words. At times, you're going to have to deliver

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.619
a message to someone that's necessary but difficult. And in those moments, oh, you need

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:42.700
to beg God for help, grace and mercy, to be able to communicate effectively and appropriately

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:50.340
that message. Our words are powerful, very powerful. This evening, I hope that each and

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:56.059
every one of us say, God, I want my words to be pleasing to thee. Let me finish. I said

00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:59.140
I was going to finish with this verse, but let me just finish with Psalm 19.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:09.280
Psalm 19. Look there with me. Psalm 19. We're familiar with the psalm, the heavens declare

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.740
the glory of God, the firmament showeth His handiwork, but I want you to notice verse

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:22.360
14. Psalm 19 and verse 14. We actually don't do this very often, but would you read the

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:33.520
verse with me? Psalm 19 and verse number 14. Let's read it together. Let the words of my

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:47.840
mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:59.400
In whose sight? In God's sight. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:07.520
be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.200
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege of being

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.920
able to be gathered in the house of God today. Lord, we thank you for Mother's Day, the opportunity

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:27.800
that we've had to honor the ladies of our church. God, we thank you for your word and

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:34.120
for the truth of your word. It's so applicable in our lives. It's relevant for everyday living.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:43.440
God, this message this evening is one that, I think if we'd be honest, steps on all of

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:53.640
our toes. God, I pray that that verse that we just read in unison together would be the

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.160
motto of our lives, that the words of our mouth, the meditation of our heart would be

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.880
acceptable, O Lord, in thy sight. Lord, help us to please you with our words. Help us to

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:10.040
understand this evening the power of our words. I pray that as we have a moment of invitation

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.740
that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as only you can. Oh, God, I pray that we do

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:21.040
business with you. I pray that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only. We'll

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.240
thank you for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.120
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.
