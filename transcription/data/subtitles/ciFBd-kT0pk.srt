1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,039
We're nearing the end of our study

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,920
through the book of Hebrews and

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,800
we're nearing the end of 2020,

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,880
so we're right on track and our

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,920
theme this year looking unto Jesus.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,079
And I hope that throughout the year

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,800
you have been encouraged and

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,479
strengthened and you have been

9
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,200
regularly reminded on the importance

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,479
of turning your eyes upon the Lord

11
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:20,840
and Savior Jesus Christ,

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,879
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,920
And what a blessing as we look at this.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,200
12th chapter will finish up Hebrews 12

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,280
this morning as we started this

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,959
passage of Scripture a couple of weeks ago.

17
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,319
We were challenged in the first few

18
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,840
verses of Hebrews 12 to run our race

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,319
to run the race and as we looked

20
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:42,200
at that portion of Scripture,

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,799
we understood that we are in a race

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,599
and we are to run the race and we

23
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,599
began to look at the instruction

24
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,840
that was received in this passage

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,360
of Scripture and instruction.

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,119
Regarding the race and first,

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,240
we understood how that there would

28
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,360
be hazards and obstacles that he

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,520
says that were to lay aside.

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,560
Every weight and the sin which

31
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,319
doth so easily beset us,

32
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,480
and we understand that there are

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,279
distractions that abound and how

34
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,839
important it is that we understand that.

35
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,239
And then of course,

36
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,160
the instruction that follows is

37
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,360
regarding not only our approach to

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,319
the race that were to run with patience.

39
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,680
The race that is set before us,

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,040
but also the focus of our race,

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,839
and that is that we would look to Jesus,

42
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,279
the author and finisher of our faith.

43
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,000
We also understood that he,

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,319
the Lord Jesus Christ,

45
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,279
is our example and he finished

46
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,760
the work that he was given to do.

47
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,400
And he said on the Cross of Calvary

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,480
before he gave up the ghost,

49
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
it is finished and I'm so thankful

50
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,000
that he finished the race that he

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
had if we could use that terminology

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,199
this morning and understanding that

53
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,599
he finished the will of God and he

54
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,080
went to the Cross of Calvary.

55
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,000
He was crucified as we've spoken

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,199
about already this morning through song.

57
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,720
He was buried and he rose in victory,

58
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,599
conquering sin, death and the grave.

59
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,839
Now this morning as we finish chapter

60
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,839
number 12 we begin to look at the finish line.

61
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,880
So we started in chapter number 12

62
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,279
looking at run the race run your race.

63
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,320
And if you think about a race,

64
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,800
you would certainly expect that

65
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
there would be a starting block

66
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,880
and that there would be a finish line.

67
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,240
And this morning as we look at verses

68
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,399
18 through 29 and finish up Hebrews

69
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,679
chapter number 12, we will look at

70
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,440
this subject the finish line.

71
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
That's the title for the message.

72
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
The finish line notice with me.

73
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,440
If you look in verse number 18,

74
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,880
the Bible says this for ye are not

75
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,000
come unto the Mount that might be touched.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
And that burned with fire nor unto

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,839
blackness and darkness and tempest

78
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,360
and the sound of a trumpet in the

79
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,720
voice of words which voice they that

80
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,000
heard entreated that the word should

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,559
not be spoken to them anymore for

82
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,240
they could not endure that which was

83
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,000
commanded and if so much as a beast

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,320
touched the mountain it shall be

85
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,839
stoned or thrust through with a dart.

86
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,520
And so terrible was the sight that

87
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,479
Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake.

88
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,520
Notice the next word of verse number 22.

89
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,759
The very first word, but what a great

90
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,279
contrast, a conjunction that is a

91
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,919
change of direction he's speaking here.

92
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,000
About Sinai in those first few verses,

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but you find here in verse 22,

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,520
but ye are come unto Mount Zion and

95
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,360
under the city of the living God,

96
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
the heavenly Jerusalem,

97
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,720
and to an innumerable company of

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,520
angels to the General Assembly and

99
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,279
Church of the firstborn which are

100
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,679
written in heaven and to God,

101
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,600
the judge of all and to the spirits

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,720
of just men made perfect and to Jesus,

103
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,240
the mediator of the New Covenant.

104
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,279
Into the blood of sprinkling that

105
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,440
speaketh better things than that of

106
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,559
able we will go through verse number

107
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,559
29 this morning because we dig into

108
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,039
the message I want you to notice.

109
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,039
First of all with me,

110
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,960
if you're taking notes,

111
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
notice the contrast we've read.

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,839
Verses 18 through 24 is our

113
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,800
introduction this morning,

114
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,039
and in those verses we find that God

115
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,919
is providing us with a contrast.

116
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,720
Of course we are reminded as we've

117
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
studied the book of Hebrews and as

118
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,279
we've gone through the content of

119
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,799
this book and understanding the

120
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,359
original recipients of this book,

121
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,720
that these Hebrew believers,

122
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
these Jewish believers,

123
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,959
that they would have had a very good

124
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,160
understanding, a good grasp on

125
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
Old Testament teaching.

126
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,720
They would have been very familiar with

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,480
that which is mentioned in verses 18,

128
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,359
down through verse number 21,

129
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,720
speaking about the events at Mount Sinai,

130
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
and understanding that

131
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,880
these Jewish believers,

132
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,320
they of course held Moses in high regard.

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,200
They were familiar with the Pentateuch.

134
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,040
They were familiar with the Ten Commandments.

135
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,679
They were familiar with this event

136
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,079
that led to the giving of the law,

137
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,160
the Old Covenant.

138
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,000
We find that as we would look at

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
the description in verses 18 through 21,

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
and we would see that this mountain,

141
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
he says in verse 18,

142
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
ye are not come unto the

143
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,200
mount that might be touched.

144
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,119
And so as we would consider the race

145
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:10,160
and we would consider the finish line,

146
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,519
he starts by telling these believers,

147
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,600
now remember,

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,079
these very believers,

149
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,200
they are considering the thought

150
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,079
of returning to Judaism.

151
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,200
They have been given many instructions

152
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,239
with regard to how that Christ is better.

153
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,320
It's been proven over and over,

154
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,119
and they've been given this challenge,

155
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,600
this command to continue to press on,

156
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,040
to move forward,

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,799
and we find that they are now being told,

158
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,559
listen, this is not what we're coming to.

159
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,359
We're not coming to Mount Sinai.

160
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,200
So he's gonna use that example of the Old Testament,

161
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,600
the mount that might be touched,

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
he says, and that burned with fire,

163
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,040
nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest.

164
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,519
He begins to describe the events at Mount Sinai.

165
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,640
In just a moment, we'll look at Exodus 19

166
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,279
and notice the record that is given there.

167
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,640
But I wanna call your attention

168
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,519
to what the Bible says in verse number 20.

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,239
It says, for they could not endure

170
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,359
that which was commanded.

171
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,559
And if so much as a beast touched the mountain,

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,279
it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart.

173
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,880
It then says this, and so terrible was the sight

174
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,079
that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake.

175
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,760
Hold your place here in Hebrews 12

176
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,239
and turn back to Exodus 19, if you will,

177
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,880
and look at what's taking place.

178
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,559
We're familiar with that Exodus 20

179
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,000
records for us the 10 commandments

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,959
and then goes from there into the law

181
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,480
in a broader spectrum.

182
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,640
But we find here in Exodus chapter number 19

183
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
that God gives us the record

184
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,959
about this which has taken place

185
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,519
that the writer of Hebrews is referring to

186
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,279
in verses 18 through 21 of chapter 12.

187
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,880
And we find that here in Exodus chapter number 19,

188
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,640
we'll pick it up right in the middle of the text,

189
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,920
but look in verse number nine.

190
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,320
The Bible says this, and the Lord said unto Moses,

191
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,079
lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud

192
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,239
that the people may hear when I speak with thee

193
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,079
and believe thee forever.

194
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,040
And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord,

195
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,320
and the Lord said unto Moses,

196
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,679
go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow

197
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,839
and let them wash their clothes

198
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,720
and be ready against the third day.

199
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,679
For the third day, the Lord will come down

200
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:27,160
in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai.

201
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,519
And thou shalt set bounds unto the people,

202
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,440
round about saying, take heed to yourselves

203
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,119
that ye go not up into the mount

204
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,920
or touch the border of it.

205
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,600
Notice this, whosoever toucheth the mount

206
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,079
shall be surely put to death.

207
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,959
Great consequence for not heeding the warning

208
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,000
that is given in verse number 12,

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,839
when he says that you're to set bounds

210
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,839
unto the people, round about,

211
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,500
as a side, not really part of the message,

212
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,519
but just a side thought this morning.

213
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,119
Sometimes we think that fences are a bad thing,

214
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,839
that they're just designed to keep us in,

215
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,779
but they're also designed to keep things out,

216
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,579
and they're there for our protection,

217
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:11,380
and Moses put this bound as the direction of the Lord

218
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,579
and said to the people, take heed to yourselves

219
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,579
that you go not up into the mount

220
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,779
or touch the border of it.

221
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,420
Whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death.

222
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,619
There shall not in hand touch it,

223
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,220
but he shall be surely stoned or shot through,

224
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,940
whether it be beast or man.

225
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,059
It shall not live.

226
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,020
When the trumpet soundeth long,

227
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,679
they shall come up to the mount.

228
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,559
Verse 14, and Moses went down from the mount

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,520
unto the people and sanctified the people,

230
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640
and they washed their clothes.

231
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,960
And he said unto the people,

232
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,700
be ready against the third day,

233
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,159
come not at your wives.

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,580
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning

235
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,559
that there were thunders and lightnings

236
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,000
and a thick cloud upon the mount,

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud,

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,159
so that all the people that was in the camp,

239
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,159
what does it say?

240
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,679
Trembled.

241
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,520
They trembled.

242
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,919
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp

243
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,840
to meet with God,

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,840
and they stood at the nether part of the mount,

245
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,520
and Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,

246
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,000
because the Lord descended upon it in fire,

247
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,880
and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,

248
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
and the whole mount quaked greatly.

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,440
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long,

250
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
and waxed louder and louder,

251
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

252
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,239
We see here in verse number 20,

253
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,440
it says, and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai

254
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
on the top of the mount,

255
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,039
and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount,

256
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,039
and Moses went up.

257
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,880
If you continue looking at the passage,

258
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,679
the Bible says that the Lord said unto Moses,

259
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,919
go down, charge the people,

260
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,159
lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze,

261
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,440
and many of them perish.

262
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,599
Again, another warning that is given

263
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,080
with regard that they're not to come upon this mount.

264
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,159
Verse 22, and let the priest also,

265
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,599
which come near to the Lord,

266
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,719
sanctify themselves,

267
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,799
lest the Lord break through upon them.

268
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,080
And Moses said unto the Lord,

269
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,159
the people cannot come up to Mount Sinai

270
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,239
for their charge is to us,

271
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,479
saying, set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.

272
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,320
The Lord.

273
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,460
unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and Aaron with thee

274
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,500
but let not the priest and the people break through to come up unto the Lord

275
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
lest he break forth upon them so Moses went down into the people and spake

276
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,700
unto them and then we find that the Bible gives us in chapter 20 the

277
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,140
record of the Ten Commandments the broader law as you continue to go

278
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,220
through the next several chapters of the book of Exodus and we find here that the

279
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:31,440
writer of Hebrews is reminding these Jewish believers of this event that took

280
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,940
place as recorded in Exodus 19 and in so doing he's making this contrast because

281
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,760
he says we're not coming to that mount he says for ye are not come unto the

282
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,680
mount that might be touched and he's dealing with that of Mount Sinai of

283
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,080
course to follow the theme that we've discussed through the book of Hebrews up

284
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,680
to this point that Christ is better and we talked about a better covenant

285
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,600
remember several probably at this point months ago as we were looking and

286
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,400
dealing with the better covenant and the fact that that first covenant it was not

287
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,360
faultless and we find that in chapter number eight he deals with that new

288
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,120
covenant a better covenant and what he's referring to here in verses 18 through

289
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,520
21 is that old covenant the law and he reminds them of that mount and then he's

290
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,360
going to use this contrast and as we notice the contrast we come to verse

291
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,600
number 22 and he says but ye are come unto Mount Zion now there's a great

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,400
contrast between Mount Sinai and Mount Zion and we find that the read the

293
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,320
reader as they would receive this instruction that they are being

294
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,600
encouraged to consider the finish line this race that they have been

295
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,640
instructed to run as we began the twelfth chapter that were to run the

296
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,120
race were to run it with patience were to were to keep our eyes upon Jesus were

297
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,840
to consider him and we find that as we live this life this Christian life that

298
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,280
the analogy has been given as the race that there is a finish line and when we

299
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,760
get to that finish line it's not going to be Mount Sinai but Mount Zion heaven

300
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,320
itself and we find here that he says but you're come unto Mount Zion notice as

301
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
the description is given as we continue looking through these verses of

302
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,160
scripture it says this and unto the city of the living God the heavenly

303
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels the Bible says to the general

304
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,040
assembly in church the firstborn we find that here in this first statement of

305
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,000
verse number 23 he's talking about those that have been born again those that

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
have been saved by the blood of the crucified one for he says there which

307
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,640
are written in heaven no doubt a reference to the Lamb's Book of Life and

308
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,040
we consider this morning that as believers that heaven is our home we've

309
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,560
understood as we've studied chapter number 11 already and we've made the

310
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,960
statement that we are strangers and pilgrims that this world is not my home

311
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,120
and we're just a passing through we're not home but we're going home and that's

312
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,920
a tremendous blessing and here as the finish line comes into sight as we

313
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,320
begin to be encouraged with the end of our race and coming to that finish line

314
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,040
he's giving this description he says not only to the general assembly and Church

315
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,880
of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all so you

316
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,120
think about heaven people say what's heaven like what we can begin to give

317
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,320
some descriptions and we can begin to talk about heaven this morning in the

318
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,520
streets of gold and all of that and what a blessing that is but the the real

319
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,480
joy is to understand that for all of eternity we're going to be in the

320
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,440
presence of God Almighty as we find here the Bible says and to God the judge of

321
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
all and it says into the spirits of just men made perfect I believe as we look at

322
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,840
that last statement of verse number 23 really dealing with those Old Testament

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,440
saints and how they looked forward to Calvary and remember as we ended chapter

324
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,440
number 11 and we talked about those that had had run the race that they had

325
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,520
received a good report but Christ had not come in their lifetime and they were

326
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,040
looking toward Calvary we now look back at Calvary but to think about the host

327
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,520
in heaven those that have by faith trusted in Christ those that in the Old

328
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,399
Testament were looking forward to Calvary those of us in the New Testament

329
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:37,920
that are looking back to Calvary and all by faith notice in verse 24 and to

330
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant remember as we spoke about the contrast

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,640
here between Mount Sinai and Mount Zion we would think about the contrast of the

332
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Old Covenant and the New Covenant the Old Covenant being law the New Covenant

333
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,040
being grace and we find here that the Bible says into Jesus the mediator of

334
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,360
the New Covenant again as we studied in the 8th chapter of the book of Hebrews

335
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,320
and began to deal with the subject matter of the New Covenant and we dealt

336
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,640
with many things with regard to that several weeks ago and we find here that

337
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,000
the Bible tells us that when we get to that finish line that we're going to see

338
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,399
our Savior and Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant in that wonderful we sing

339
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,000
songs about seeing Jesus we have songwriters that have gone before us

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,320
that have written great songs about the day that they would see Christ and I'm

341
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,200
reminded even this morning as we were singing and thinking reflecting on our

342
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,080
salvation and the price that was paid for our salvation that one day one

343
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,200
glorious day we shall see him and that wonderful the Bible says here in our

344
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,559
text of Scripture and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the

345
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:59,279
blood of sprinkling notice what it says that speaketh better things than that of

346
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,040
Abel another reference to the blood of Christ and we find that throughout the

347
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,279
book of Hebrews there's been many references to the blood of Christ and to

348
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,520
the the fact that his blood is superior his work is superior of course as Peter

349
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,640
would tell us that it's the precious blood of Christ and it's because Christ

350
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,839
is God in flesh the sinless perfect Lamb of God that shed his precious blood and

351
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,559
what a joy as we look at this and we consider the finish line that we

352
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,160
understand that there's so much more than what this world has to offer I

353
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,520
want you to just for a moment think about the philosophy and the ideologies

354
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,839
of those in our world today those that are void of a biblical worldview those

355
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,679
that would try to live life on this plane and and have the idea what is

356
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,760
their goal what is their finish line what is it that they're working towards

357
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,399
what is it that they're seeking to accomplish he who has the most toys he

358
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,240
who has the most possessions the most riches whatever it may be but the

359
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,279
reality is that they do not have a finish line like we have a finish line

360
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,119
they don't have the hope of heaven the reality is that there are billions of

361
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,679
people in our world today that are going to die and spend eternity in the

362
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,040
lake of fire because they have not trusted Jesus Christ as their personal

363
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,880
Savior and for us that have been redeemed those of us that have trusted

364
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,399
Jesus Christ our personal Savior because we heard the gospel and received the

365
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:37,440
truth of the gospel and we've placed our faith and trust in the finished work of

366
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,480
Christ at Calvary we have this finish line that is so much different than the

367
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,320
end of mankind without Christ see for us this morning if you're saved death is

368
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,880
but a doorway from this life to the next and we leave this world and we go to be

369
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,119
with our Savior we're reminded in 2nd Corinthians 5 in verse number 8 where

370
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,440
Paul makes that declaration that we're confident of this thing what to be

371
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,960
absent from the body is to be present with the Lord Paul understood the

372
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,800
reality and the certainty of heaven and this morning as we begin to look at this

373
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,279
passage of Scripture and we see this contrast our minds race to the scene of

374
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,839
heaven and we think about that glorious finish line I don't know when I'm gonna

375
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,160
reach the finish line and neither do you but one day we're gonna take our last

376
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,720
breath here upon this earth I don't know when that day is but isn't it a joy to

377
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,479
know that Jesus is your Savior listen we're living in a day today where

378
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:42,600
there's much confusion I've said this as we look at all of the events that have

379
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,880
taken place in the last weeks and months and especially in the last days that one

380
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,479
word that could describe the scene in America today is uncertainty there's so

381
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:58,520
much uncertainty oh there's a host of division and all the things that are

382
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,799
going on but as the people of God we have some things that we're certain of

383
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:10,679
and this morning I want to encourage you not to focus upon those uncertainties of

384
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,799
life but to focus upon the certainties that God gives us through His Word to

385
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,679
focus upon Jesus the author and finisher of our faith to know that yes we're

386
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,000
running a race and there's going to be obstacles and adversities and

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,919
difficulties but there's a finish line and when we get there we're gonna be in

388
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,280
heaven and all that ought to cause us to rejoice it changes our perspective we

389
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,200
understand that as I prayed even this morning that we're in the world but

390
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,119
we're not of the world and what a joy to know listen I understand that people can

391
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,440
get down and people can get under the circumstances but oh how we need to lift

392
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
our eyes to Jesus and change our perspective so that we can focus upon

393
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,559
those certainties and we can have the joy and the peace

394
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,439
It's a joy that no man can take from you.

395
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:09,459
It is a peace that passeth all understanding.

396
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,339
Oh, would we rejoice in that this morning.

397
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,419
We find here that there's a great contrast.

398
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,179
Let me remind you,

399
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,059
as we think about this finish line

400
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,259
of what Jesus said in John 14

401
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,059
as He's speaking to His disciples,

402
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,859
and we find that they were troubled

403
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,819
at the message that they had received

404
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,779
in chapter 13 with regard to Christ

405
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,379
going to Calvary and all that

406
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:34,139
had taken place, and Jesus says to them

407
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,099
in John 14 in verse number one,

408
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,299
let not your heart be troubled.

409
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:39,859
Can I tell you this morning

410
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:41,819
that the same message is true

411
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:44,739
for the people of God in 2020

412
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:47,159
as it was for those disciples

413
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,859
as it's recorded here in John 14.

414
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,199
Oh, would you let not your heart be troubled.

415
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,459
You believe in God, believe also in me.

416
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,399
In my Father's house are many mansions.

417
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,219
If it were not so, I would have told you.

418
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,779
He says, I go to prepare a place for you.

419
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:03,819
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

420
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:07,500
I will come again and receive you unto myself

421
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,279
that where I am, there ye may be also.

422
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,459
This morning, we have a whole list

423
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,339
of things that are certain

424
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,259
that we can be confident of,

425
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,139
that we can rejoice in.

426
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,279
I submit to you this morning

427
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,659
that if you focus upon the uncertainties of life,

428
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,779
it's gonna cause you to get down.

429
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,819
It's gonna cause you to become discouraged.

430
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,339
It's gonna cause you to become overwhelmed.

431
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,019
You listen, I said this months ago

432
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,019
when we started this whole COVID crisis

433
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,019
in January, February, March,

434
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:44,500
and things began to kind of spike in March

435
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,540
and come to a head.

436
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,779
And I said to many people at that particular time

437
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,439
that if you're going to watch the news,

438
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,019
that you ought to take the amount of minutes

439
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,639
that you watch the news and multiply it by three

440
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,860
and spend that much time in the word of God.

441
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,899
There's no fancy calculations that I came up with.

442
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,220
I just said that right off the top of my head.

443
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,500
But I would submit to you that even still today,

444
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,259
with all the things going on in our world,

445
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,259
all the confusion and uncertainties,

446
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:11,259
if you spend all your time watching some news agency,

447
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,580
I don't care which one it is,

448
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,819
I don't care how conservative you think they are

449
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,679
or how liberal you think they are,

450
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,099
we don't need that stuff, we need this.

451
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,739
We need the word of God.

452
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:24,959
Because it reminds us of some things that are certain.

453
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,639
Listen, Jesus is king.

454
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,520
He controls everything.

455
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Amen?

456
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,520
You believe that this morning?

457
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,279
He is king of kings and Lord of lords, the great I am.

458
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,399
And his plan is perfect.

459
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,119
We may not understand it, but our God reigns.

460
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,199
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

461
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:46,399
And we have a home reserved in heaven.

462
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,720
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians.

463
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,520
Turn there if you will,

464
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,319
as Paul is encouraging these believers in Thessalonica.

465
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,720
And what a great church this was.

466
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,880
And there was some confusion that was taking place there

467
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,279
in the church of Thessalonica.

468
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,559
There were some false teachers that had come in

469
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,639
and had kind of told them that the day of the Lord

470
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,759
had already taken place.

471
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,000
And we find that in 2 Thessalonians,

472
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,860
he deals with that even in greater specific nature.

473
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,440
But even here in 1 Thessalonians,

474
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,800
Paul is going to give them the word of the Lord.

475
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,759
He's going to give them truth

476
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,539
with regard to the rapture of the church.

477
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,660
Notice in verse 13 of 1 Thessalonians 4.

478
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,099
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren.

479
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,139
Now, I want to pause there and just say this.

480
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:36,020
God doesn't want you to be ignorant.

481
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,139
He wants you to be informed.

482
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:41,699
He's given us this book so that we could be informed,

483
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,660
so that we could have the knowledge

484
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,179
that He wants us to have.

485
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,020
He told us that if any man lack wisdom,

486
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,979
let him ask of God,

487
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:50,220
who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not.

488
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,660
We find that He's given us the written Word of God.

489
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,059
We have the mind of Christ.

490
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,380
Let this mind be in you,

491
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,819
which was also in Christ Jesus.

492
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,300
That's what Paul says in Philippians 2,

493
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,419
in verse 5.

494
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,500
And we need to understand that Paul says,

495
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,699
listen, I don't want you to be ignorant.

496
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:06,819
I want you to be informed.

497
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,979
I want you to understand some things.

498
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,380
He says this.

499
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,139
Contextually, what he's speaking about

500
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,380
are those that have died,

501
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,059
concerning them which are asleep,

502
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,019
that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

503
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,299
Aren't you thankful to not be in the category

504
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,980
of those that have no hope?

505
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,619
A lot of people in our world today that are hopeless.

506
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,739
They're hopeless.

507
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,299
Verse 14.

508
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,459
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

509
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:40,940
do you believe that this morning?

510
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,980
Do you believe that He died?

511
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,779
I mean, Paul says, here's the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 15.

512
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,500
The Gospel is this, that Jesus died

513
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,339
according to the Scriptures,

514
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,540
that He was buried according to the Scriptures,

515
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,019
that He rose again according to the Scriptures.

516
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:52,899
That's the Gospel.

517
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,899
The death, burial, and glorious resurrection

518
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:56,500
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

519
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,419
And here Paul says,

520
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,419
if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

521
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,859
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

522
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,739
will God bring with Him.

523
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,739
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord.

524
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:11,019
Now, again, I pause here to say,

525
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,419
we need to rejoice in the fact,

526
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,019
this isn't just Paul's opinion.

527
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:15,859
You ever have somebody say,

528
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:18,019
hey, would you give me your opinion on this?

529
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,220
Do you know that your opinion doesn't matter?

530
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,700
And neither does mine.

531
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,540
Honestly.

532
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,459
Paul says, I don't want you to be ignorant,

533
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,059
and I want you to understand something.

534
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,419
I'm giving you the word of the Lord.

535
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,540
This isn't just my opinion of last day things.

536
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,779
This isn't just my opinion of what's going to happen

537
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:36,820
to those that have died.

538
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,660
This is the word of the living God.

539
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,739
He says, for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

540
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,820
that we which are alive and remain

541
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
under the coming of the Lord

542
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,500
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

543
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,660
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

544
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,940
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

545
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,260
and with the trump of God,

546
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,100
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

547
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,260
Then we which are alive and remain

548
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,899
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

549
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:02,500
to meet the Lord in the air,

550
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,660
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

551
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,459
Isn't that precious?

552
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:11,899
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

553
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,859
Need comfort today?

554
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:15,779
The word of God will comfort you.

555
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:18,779
God says of Himself in 2 Corinthians chapter number one

556
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,139
that He is the God of all comfort.

557
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:24,980
The Bible tells us that Jesus says this of the Holy Spirit

558
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,579
that He is the comforter

559
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,700
and that He was going to send the comforter to be with us.

560
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,619
Oh, we need comfort.

561
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,940
We have the Holy Spirit of God who comforts us.

562
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,299
God Himself is the God of all comfort.

563
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,179
He gives us His word to comfort us.

564
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:41,980
Let not your heart be troubled.

565
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,579
No, be comforted through the truth of the word of God.

566
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,660
Listen, I don't know when the trumpet of the Lord

567
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,619
is going to sound, but I know one day it's going to.

568
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,179
And there's something else that I know

569
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,419
from the word of God.

570
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,500
The Bible tells us in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

571
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,179
as we begin to understand that

572
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,220
which is going to happen in the last days

573
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,260
and all that's going to take place,

574
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,019
that this world, the inhabitants of this world,

575
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,100
it's going to wax worse and worse.

576
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,619
Evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse,

577
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,579
deceiving and being deceived.

578
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:17,739
And we find that those things are going to happen.

579
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,100
Listen, there will come a time

580
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,899
when men will not endure sound doctrine.

581
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:24,459
But guess what Paul told Timothy anyway?

582
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,419
Preach the word.

583
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,139
Be instant in season, out of season,

584
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:31,260
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine

585
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,820
in one word, continue.

586
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,339
Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

587
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:40,579
and been assured of.

588
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:43,500
And then he goes into the word of God.

589
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,820
That all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

590
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,500
It's profitable.

591
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,540
And we begin to understand this morning

592
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,500
that as we look at this finish line

593
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,380
and we consider the contrast

594
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,779
here in Hebrews chapter number 12

595
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:57,899
and we see how that he's contrasting

596
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,980
the old covenant, the law with Mount Sinai,

597
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,459
with the new covenant,

598
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,980
and that Jesus is the mediator of this new covenant.

599
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,739
Of course, he's the testator as we'd mentioned

600
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:12,139
prior to this study in looking in the book of Hebrews

601
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:16,700
in that he died so that those things could be initiated.

602
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,100
And we find here that as we would consider the contrast

603
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,660
that we're made aware of this finish line,

604
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,260
this new covenant, Mount Zion,

605
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,739
not the old covenant, but the new covenant,

606
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,619
and heaven itself, what a joy.

607
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,539
See, we speak, we ask the question,

608
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,500
are you 100% sure if you were to die today

609
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,859
that heaven is your home?

610
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,979
We ask that question regularly.

611
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:44,539
We ask it in church services.

612
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,140
We ask it when we speak to people

613
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,099
that we come in contact with.

614
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,380
Are you sure of heaven?

615
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,140
And this morning, we have that confidence

616
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,179
that that finish line, when we're running this race,

617
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,059
the finish line is heaven.

618
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,739
We're gonna be with our Savior for all of eternity.

619
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,020
I hope that would change our perspective.

620
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,580
I hope that that would encourage us this morning.

621
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,020
We see that there's a contrast, number two in our notes,

622
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,580
if you continue to look through Hebrews 12

623
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,619
and look at verses 25 through 27,

624
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,219
we notice the contrast, number two,

625
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,460
we notice the caution.

626
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,419
We notice the caution.

627
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:21,099
As we look at these verses of Scripture,

628
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,900
we find that there is a caution here

629
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,820
at the very beginning of verse 25.

630
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,659
The Bible says this,

631
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,659
see that ye refuse not him that speaketh.

632
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,659
Now, it's interesting to think about this word of caution

633
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,340
that begins verse number 25

634
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,539
because it really goes in harmony

635
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,460
with those warnings that we've already received

636
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,700
in the book of Hebrews.

637
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,260
We understand that as we start in Hebrews chapter number one,

638
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,820
the Bible speaks to us about the fact that God speaks.

639
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,140
And of course, we have his word.

640
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,340
Notice in verse number one of Hebrews one,

641
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,140
God who at sundry times and in divers manners

642
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,779
spake in time past under the fathers by the prophets

643
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:01,619
hath in these

644
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:07,079
last days, spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by

645
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:13,359
whom also he made the worlds." He tells them in chapter number two, in verses one

646
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,239
through three, he tells them to listen up. I preached a message that I titled

647
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,719
listen up. It says in verse number one, therefore we ought to give the more

648
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,959
earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let

649
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,879
them slip. And I said this, I remember distinctly making this statement when I

650
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:33,779
preached that message many months ago from Hebrews chapter number two, have you

651
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,699
ever had somebody say to you, listen up? We have. We've had somebody say, a class,

652
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:43,919
a teacher, whatever the context, a parent, say, hey listen up. What I'm gonna tell

653
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,019
you is important. Listen, we need to listen to God. We need to listen to his

654
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:51,659
word. We find that in chapter number three, in verses seven and fifteen, and

655
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:56,019
really the entirety of that latter part of Hebrews chapter number three, the

656
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:00,119
Bible reminds us about hearing and believing. In verse number seven of

657
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,199
Hebrews chapter number three, it says, wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, today

658
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:10,359
if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation in the

659
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,839
day of temptation in the wilderness. Notice in verse number fifteen, while it

660
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,399
is said, today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the

661
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,759
provocation. Remember in chapter number five, we read the warning passage in

662
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:29,079
verses eleven through fourteen. Paul began, or the writer of Hebrews if you

663
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,779
think it's not Paul, began to discuss the subject matter of Melchizedek, and he

664
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,699
began to speak about the high priest or the superiority of Christ's

665
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:43,659
priesthood, and he begins to deal with that subject matter, but then he says to

666
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:49,259
them that they were dull of hearing, in verse number eleven. He said, I have

667
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:53,179
many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing that you're dull of

668
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,279
hearing, and so we've received these warning passages throughout the book of

669
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,919
Hebrews, and we find it as we come to chapter number twelve in verse number

670
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,799
twenty-five, that the Bible, in line with these other warnings, it says, see that

671
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:14,159
you refuse not him that speaketh. Listen, there may be some people that speak that

672
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,940
you can tune off, tune out, and it's not gonna really mess you up too much, but we

673
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,559
need to hear the Word of God. We need to listen up. We need to be in tune. He that

674
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,080
hath ears, let him hear. It says, see that you refuse not him that speaketh, for if

675
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,360
they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth. Now, what's he talking

676
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,119
about? He's using that analogy again, or that illustration again, of verses eighteen

677
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,239
through twenty-one, Mount Sinai, and the giving of the law. Remember, what was it

678
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:48,360
said? There were to be some bounds, and they couldn't cross, and if they touched,

679
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,619
they were gonna die. Hey, if they didn't listen, there was a grave consequence. So

680
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:57,979
we find here that there's this caution about listening and refusing not him

681
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:02,339
that speaketh. It says, for if they escaped not who refused him that spake

682
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,739
on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh

683
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:12,979
from heaven, whose voice then shook the earth. Remember, they trembled at that

684
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,559
scene at Sinai. It says, but now he hath promised, saying, yet once more I shake

685
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,479
not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word yet once more signifieth the

686
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:29,159
removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made, that

687
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,440
those things which cannot be shaken may remain. We begin to really look here as

688
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,199
we have the truth that is given to us, and we think about the giving of the

689
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:44,459
law on Mount Sinai, and really we think about his second coming when the Bible

690
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:48,099
speaks about here that not only the earth only would shake, but also heaven.

691
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:52,339
And we begin to think about the fact that he says, refuse not him that

692
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:57,659
speaketh. This morning I hope that you're thankful for the Word of God. I hope that

693
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,619
you understand that we have the complete canon of Scripture, and that God has

694
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,739
given us his Word, and oh that it would be in our minds this morning to

695
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:10,000
understand that it is in our best interest to obey, to take heed to the

696
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,720
Word of God. Just as it was in Exodus 19, it was in the best interest of those

697
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,479
children of Israel to listen to what the man of God said as he gave them the Word

698
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:27,359
of God. And as we look here and we consider the Bible the Word of God, and

699
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,380
we understand that the Scriptures that are profitable for us. I preached a

700
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,059
message last night at a youth rally about being warned. And you know the

701
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:42,540
the interesting thing in Psalm 19 and in verses 7 through 10 describes the Bible,

702
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,459
the law of the Lord is perfect, and it goes through that section and really

703
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:51,139
just helps us to rejoice in what we have in the Scriptures. And then you come to

704
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:56,579
verse number 11, and the Bible says that by them, moreover by them is thy servant

705
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:01,940
warned. I wonder this morning, when's the last time you've been warned from the

706
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,380
Bible? And when's the last time in your Bible reading, in your daily walk with

707
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,260
God, that you've received warning? And the question is what do you do with it? Do

708
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,660
you take heed? Do you take heed to the warning that you've received from the

709
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,859
Word of God? It is in our best interest. Peter would say this over in 2nd Peter

710
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:25,619
chapter number 1, turn there if you will, many people have this idea, I've heard

711
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,100
many tell me this throughout my years of ministry, well I just wish God would talk

712
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:36,260
to me in an audible voice. He's given us His Word. And as I've mentioned, even as

713
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,699
we study through the book of Genesis, that when we read the Scriptures and we

714
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,940
see where the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Abram, the Lord spake unto

715
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,019
Abram, the Lord spake unto Abraham, we read those verses of Scripture and

716
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,540
really, for that matter, anyone that we read in the Scriptures where it's given

717
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,979
in that manner, we must understand that when we approach the Word of God, because

718
00:35:56,139 --> 00:36:02,179
this is the living Word of God, that God is speaking to us. And God is giving us

719
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:07,660
truth to help us. And Peter says this in 2nd Peter chapter number 1, it says this

720
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,859
in verse 16, we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made

721
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:16,500
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were

722
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:23,220
eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and

723
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,139
glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the excellent glory. And it

724
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:32,220
says this, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. You know what Peter's

725
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,380
talking about? He's talking about the Mount of Transfiguration. He's talking

726
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,459
about when Peter, James, and John had the privilege alone, just them, to go up into

727
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:44,739
the mountain to see the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ when He was

728
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:49,220
transfigured. And of course Peter, he didn't know what to say and he didn't

729
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,179
know what he was saying. He talked about making some tabernacles because there

730
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:55,779
was Moses and Elijah there as well, and let's make one for you and one for

731
00:36:55,779 --> 00:37:00,100
Elijah and one for Moses. And then what happened? Moses and Elijah are gone and

732
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,940
it shone and you heard the voice of God the Father, this is my beloved Son in

733
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:12,820
whom I am well pleased. Peter says this, and this voice which came from heaven we

734
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,220
heard and we were with Him in the Holy Mount. He's given testimony, He's an

735
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,139
eyewitness. The gospel records record this event. Now Peter is speaking about

736
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:29,579
it, but notice what he says in verse number 19. For we have also a more sure

737
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:37,299
word of prophecy. Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that

738
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:42,619
shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your

739
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:46,699
hearts. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scriptures of any

740
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:51,059
private interpretation, for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man,

741
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:56,739
but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. I'm so thankful

742
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:00,540
that we have a more sure word of prophecy. I'm thankful that God has seen

743
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,979
fit to give us the Bible in its entirety. I've often said over the years that no

744
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:13,220
one demanded that God gave us a word or how long this word had to be or what the

745
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,979
content had to be, but God in His grace, His mercy, and in His love for His people,

746
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:24,100
He gave us the Word of God. The very first mention of the book of the law

747
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,859
would be in Joshua chapter number 1. When you read that Moses, of course, the law

748
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,500
of the five books, we refer to it as the Pentateuch, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,

749
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,900
Numbers, and Deuteronomy. That now is finished, and God says to Joshua, this

750
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,179
book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate

751
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:47,179
therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is

752
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:51,460
written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou

753
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,900
shalt have good success. And we find that God has given us a word. Listen, we need

754
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,179
to take heed to the caution. He says this, see that you refuse not Him that

755
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,700
speaketh. This morning, when we're running this race and we're thinking about the

756
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:14,020
finish line, we must be aware of the fact that there is a finish line.

757
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,580
There's this contrast that's given. There's this caution. Listen, there are

758
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,779
some that would give us some bad counsel. There are some that would say,

759
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:25,580
hey, it's not really worth it. Hey, don't put yourself out there in that fashion.

760
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,179
No, we need to hear Him. We need to get into the Word of God and allow the Word

761
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,020
of God to influence us and instruct us and that we would understand that in the

762
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,179
midst of all that's going on, if you were perhaps reading for the very first time

763
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:43,339
the content of 2 Timothy chapter number 3, if you were Timothy receiving in the

764
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,179
first century this letter from Paul giving you all of this description about

765
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,779
the last days and all of these things that are going to come, perilous times

766
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:57,099
and all of these things, you might not expect that the word of advice and

767
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:03,539
counsel would be, continue. That's exactly what it is.

768
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:10,459
And as the people of God, as we're running the race, we find that there's, yes, a contrast,

769
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:14,339
there's a caution, and it finishes with a charge.

770
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,339
Notice number three with me.

771
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:19,119
I want you to notice the charge in verses 28 and 29.

772
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,059
The Bible says this,

773
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:31,579
Wherefore we, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may

774
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:41,439
serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire.

775
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,619
As we look at this passage of Scripture and we've considered the contrast, the caution,

776
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:50,299
we now see that there's a charge we've mentioned during that caution about the way in which

777
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:52,339
the heavens and earth would shake.

778
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,819
Would notice in verse 27, it says,

779
00:40:54,819 --> 00:41:00,099
In this word yet once more signifyeth the removing of those things that are shaken as

780
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:04,279
of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

781
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,739
And then it says in verse 28,

782
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:13,499
Wherefore we, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved.

783
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:19,099
As I begin to look at the first section of verse 28 and consider this charge, we find

784
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:25,619
that it begins really with helping us to realize the surety of our inheritance.

785
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,499
The surety of our inheritance.

786
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:32,299
What a blessing to know that we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved.

787
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:36,139
I want you to think about a few verses of Scripture with me this morning as we consider

788
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:38,979
the surety of our inheritance.

789
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,539
Notice what the Bible says in John chapter number 10.

790
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,619
Look at three portions of Scripture and look at what the Word of God says with regard to

791
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:53,399
the surety of our inheritance.

792
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:59,679
In verse number 27 of John chapter number 10, Jesus says this,

793
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:08,079
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

794
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,079
Notice verse 28,

795
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:17,639
And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man

796
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,199
pluck them out of my hand.

797
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,479
The Bible says that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

798
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:26,839
Jesus Christ our Lord.

799
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,839
And here Jesus says,

800
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,239
I give unto them eternal life, that's the gift of God, and it says they shall never

801
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,839
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

802
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:39,279
My Father, verse 29, which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck

803
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,519
them out of my Father's hand.

804
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,839
I and my Father are one.

805
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,279
We find that not only here do we see this truth of the surety of our inheritance, but

806
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:52,679
I want you to notice what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter number 1.

807
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,919
In Ephesians chapter number 1, Paul is writing to this church that he had the privilege of

808
00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:02,839
being able to minister in, and seeing established, and as he's writing back to these believers,

809
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,559
this book of Ephesians really begins, and the first several chapters deal with our position

810
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,359
in Christ, who we are in Christ.

811
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,599
And we find that in verse number 13 of Ephesians 1, the Bible says this,

812
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:23,679
In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.

813
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:25,359
Now let me pause there just for a moment.

814
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,959
The Bible says that the gospel, as we've already declared and discussed this morning, is the

815
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,639
death, burial, and glorious resurrection of Jesus.

816
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:38,159
The Bible says that Paul, he says to the church in Rome, to the believers there in Rome, I

817
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,379
am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone

818
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:45,339
that believeth, the Jew first and also the Greek.

819
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,839
And so here, he's preached the gospel.

820
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,739
By the way, the Bible says, So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word

821
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:51,739
of God.

822
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:55,379
Remember Romans 10 and verse number 13, For whosoever shall call upon the name of the

823
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:56,659
Lord shall be saved.

824
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,959
How then shall they call on him in whom they've not heard?

825
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,939
How shall they hear without a preacher?

826
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:06,819
And so we see that the word of God, the gospel was preached in Ephesus, and there were people

827
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:10,699
that believed, they trusted the Lord.

828
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:17,899
It says this, In whom also, after that ye believed, notice this phrase, ye were sealed

829
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:23,339
with the Holy Spirit, that Holy Spirit of promise.

830
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,339
Aren't you thankful for the Holy Spirit?

831
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:30,779
The Bible tells us that at the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit indwells every believer.

832
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:38,739
And it says in verse number 14, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption

833
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:43,699
of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory.

834
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,579
I've been bought with a price.

835
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,759
And if you're saved this morning, you've been bought with a price as well.

836
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:50,299
And you know what Jesus did?

837
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:51,959
You know what God did?

838
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:58,819
He said that I'm going to give you the Holy Spirit as the earnest of our inheritance.

839
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,939
Until the day, until the redemption of the purchased possession.

840
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:05,979
Listen, one day he's going to come to get us because he owns us.

841
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:09,659
And whether that's that we die, remember what did Paul say, for me to live is Christ

842
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:11,819
and to die is gain.

843
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:16,859
And we understand here that this surety of our inheritance, notice what Peter says in

844
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,659
first Peter chapter number one.

845
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:24,399
In first Peter chapter number one, verses three through five, notice what the scriptures

846
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:28,539
tell us about this inheritance and the surety of our inheritance.

847
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:32,619
Remember, the Bible is, we're looking here at Hebrews chapter number 12, that he says

848
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:36,019
that we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved.

849
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:40,179
In verse number three of first Peter chapter number one, it says, blessed be the God and

850
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:47,139
father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again

851
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:51,859
unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

852
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:55,739
That's talking to somebody that's saved, amen, and someone that's been born again.

853
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:03,899
And it says this, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved

854
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,419
in heaven for you.

855
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:08,859
And that sounds awfully sure, does it not?

856
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:14,099
The surety of our inheritance, it says this in verse number five, who are kept by the

857
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:19,699
power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.

858
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:26,299
I'm so thankful the word of God would teach us this morning the truth of eternal security,

859
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:28,859
the truth of the surety of our inheritance.

860
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:33,579
I believe this morning that as you'd look at the broad spectrum of Christendom, and

861
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:38,219
you begin to look historically even at those that would oppose the teaching of eternal

862
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:43,619
security, that in many of those cases it's used as a power chip.

863
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:44,779
What do I mean by that?

864
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:48,899
Well, I can tell you you have to do all of these things in order to be saved, in order

865
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:52,339
to keep your salvation, you've got to do all of these things, and if you fall out of

866
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:56,259
doing these things, then you're going to lose your salvation.

867
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:58,479
It's a power thing.

868
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:03,979
But God has bought us, He possesses us, He's given us the Holy Spirit of God, which is

869
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:06,539
the earnest of our inheritance.

870
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,339
What a blessing.

871
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,339
What a blessing.

872
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:15,739
There are people all around churches in this world today that are hearing messages that

873
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:20,059
tell them you have to do all of these things in order to be saved.

874
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:25,699
A work-based salvation followed by a work-based keeping your salvation.

875
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:29,259
If I couldn't get it in the first place, there's no way I could keep it.

876
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:34,339
Listen, if you'd be honest this morning, if you'd be honest this morning, if you could

877
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:38,979
lose your salvation, you would have lost it the day you got it.

878
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:40,919
Amen.

879
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:46,719
But I'm so thankful that we, it says here, wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot

880
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,839
be moved, it helps us to be mindful of that surety of our inheritance, notice as it continues,

881
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:52,839
let us have grace.

882
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:55,039
I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

883
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,519
The Bible speaks about His saving grace, about His serving grace.

884
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,479
We find here that it says, really the context is dealing with His serving grace, for it

885
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:10,599
says whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God as a

886
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,039
consuming fire.

887
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:16,799
As we notice here in our text of Scripture, we think about this charge, we find that really,

888
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:21,319
as we are reminded of the surety of our inheritance, remember, we're not doing these things to

889
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:26,719
keep our salvation, we're not serving God so we can keep our salvation, we have this

890
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:31,659
kingdom we've been given, we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved, we have this surety

891
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:39,239
of our inheritance, but we find that we, by the grace of God, may serve Him acceptably.

892
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:44,719
I want to serve God, not so that I can earn something, but because of all that He's done

893
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:45,719
for me.

894
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:48,679
It's a completely different perspective.

895
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:51,880
We find that the Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith, that not of yourselves

896
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,279
but the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast, and then it says, for we

897
00:48:55,279 --> 00:49:00,199
are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus, we're created unto good works.

898
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:08,119
We are to serve Him, and notice what the charge is, that we may serve God acceptably.

899
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,479
We know that it is a privilege to serve God.

900
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:18,559
We sing the song, there is joy in serving Jesus, and there is.

901
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,559
Does that mean it's always easy?

902
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,880
No.

903
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,279
Just read about Paul a little bit, amen?

904
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:29,559
We know what he says, though the outward man perish, the inward man is renewed day by day,

905
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,559
amen?

906
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,559
Why?

907
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,320
Because we're serving the Lord, and we've got our eyes, listen, when we're serving the

908
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,159
Lord, we deal with obstacles and difficulties and adversities, and maybe the very people

909
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,320
that we're serving, as Paul says as he's speaking to the churches in Galatia, he said, hey,

910
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,279
at one point you would have given me your eyesight, and now you want to, you know, you

911
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:51,599
don't want to be my friend anymore, so to speak, and all of these things, you're not

912
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,880
going to hear the truth, and the reality is that, listen, it doesn't matter how the people

913
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:01,919
would respond if we're serving Christ, we want to serve Him acceptably, that He would

914
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:03,440
be pleased with our service.

915
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,920
Not that some person would be pleased with our service, we're not looking, we're

916
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,640
not seeking the applause of man, we're seeking the the acceptable nature of our

917
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,840
God saying, this is well done, this is acceptable, this is pleasing in my sight,

918
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,800
whereby, how is it that we serve God acceptably? And notice what it says,

919
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,640
with reverence and with godly fear. With reverence and godly fear. It's

920
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,320
interesting that verse number 29 would help us to understand how it is that we

921
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:44,040
have that fear of God. It says, for our God is a consuming fire. And he is. You

922
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:52,040
know our God is holy. He's holy. It's amazing to me when you read through the

923
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:58,720
scriptures and you find instances of God's righteous judgment. You read about

924
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,000
the righteous judgment of God and you find how that it has a profound impact

925
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,959
upon other believers. In fact, it has a profound impact even upon lost people.

926
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:14,319
One such example, and my time has gone this morning, but I want to share with

927
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:19,080
you this truth from Acts chapter number 5. You remember with Ananias and Sapphira?

928
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:25,639
They lied to God. They lied to the Holy Ghost. What happened? They died.

929
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:34,560
They died. That's serious. And the Bible says that she, we'll skip right through it

930
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,760
because we don't have time, in verse number 10 of Acts 5, that she fell down

931
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,560
straight with his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came and

932
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,480
found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear

933
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,880
came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things. We want to

934
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:56,920
serve God acceptably. We want to serve God with reverence and with godly fear.

935
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,600
And this morning, it's a privilege to serve the Lord and we ought to thank God

936
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,360
for the privilege that is ours to serve him and we ought to serve him

937
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,720
acceptably. We ought to seek to serve him acceptably. You know, this morning as we

938
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,800
think about the opportunity that we have to serve Christ, it's because we're not

939
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,600
under that law anymore that we're under grace. It's by the grace of God that he

940
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:26,199
enables me to serve him. The finish line. In every race, there's a starting block

941
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,279
and there's a finish line. Where did you start this race? When you trust that

942
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:36,199
Christ is your Savior. When do you finish this race? When you take your last breath

943
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:41,919
here upon this earth. And the finish line is heaven. And oh that God would help us

944
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:48,919
to finish our race, to finish our course. You know, I never ran track and field

945
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:53,160
surprise. Amen. I was always playing a different sport. Amen. But the

946
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,639
reality is that you keep your eyes on the finish line. You keep your eyes on

947
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:03,240
the finish line. You want to get to that, you want to reach that goal. And as we

948
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,240
mentioned several weeks ago, Paul said that I might finish my course with joy.

949
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,119
And I hope this morning that we could say, I got my eyes on the finish line. I

950
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,680
don't know when I'm gonna reach it, but I want to take this charge and I want to

951
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,960
serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. Let's pray. Father, we love

952
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,680
you this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God and

953
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,919
for the truth that is contained therein. We thank you for this passage of

954
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:35,199
Scripture that contains for us a contrast. We're so thankful that as we

955
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,600
would understand these Jewish believers in this first century receiving this

956
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:45,559
this letter, this book that we call Hebrews, that they would be reminded that

957
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,520
they're not going to a mount that could be touched, Mount Sinai, but to Mount

958
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:58,360
Zion. We'd find this truth this morning that the finish line is heaven itself.

959
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,400
God, we thank you for the caution that we would listen, take heed, that we'd refuse

960
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,240
not him that speaketh. And then for this charge, God help us to serve you

961
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,199
acceptably. We know that it's by the grace of God that we are what we are. We

962
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:18,080
know that it's your grace that enables us to serve you and I pray that we'd

963
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,200
serve you acceptably with reverence and with godly fear, understanding your

964
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,360
holiness that you are a consuming fire. I pray that you'd bless, that you'd work

965
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,320
in hearts and lives. Help us, Lord, this morning to be encouraged with all of the

966
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,080
uncertainties that abound in this world. Would you help us to focus upon the

967
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:45,239
certainties of thy word, knowing that you reign and you rule, that one day

968
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,360
you're going to come again, having the certainty of heaven, that heaven is our

969
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,600
home. I've been bought with the price to be absent from the bodies to be present

970
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,640
with the Lord. I pray, God, that you'd help us this morning to be encouraged.

971
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Help us to make commitments to serve you. I pray that you'd work as only you can

972
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,760
for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes

973
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,559
are closed, no one's looking around. Would you allow God to have his way in your

974
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:19,000
life this morning? Would you rejoice in the certainty of heaven? Would you make a

975
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,519
commitment to serve the Lord acceptably? As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
