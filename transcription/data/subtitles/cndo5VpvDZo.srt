1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,879
and we'll get back to the Book of Colossians.

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,079
We will finish it up this year,

3
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:06,360
but thinking about Thanksgiving,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,520
this upcoming week on Thursday,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,720
and seeking the Lord with regard to direction for message.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,180
And I hope that between this morning and this evening,

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,920
that you will leave church today

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,559
with a whole list of reasons to rejoice, amen?

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,120
And so get your fingers ready.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,479
We're gonna begin here in 1 Peter 2.

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,280
It's just gonna be our launching spot,

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,639
and we'll look at a number of passages of scripture

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,959
throughout the morning and this evening as well.

14
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,680
And I am so thankful for the Word of God, amen?

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
And we have much to be thankful for.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,799
The Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so,

17
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,880
and we ought to have a song in our hearts.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,560
We ought to have praise on our lips.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,400
The Bible says, let everything that hath breath,

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,299
praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord, amen?

21
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,240
And man, I was encouraged by the children this morning,

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,259
memorizing Psalm 100,

23
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,139
and what a blessing to hide the Word of God in your heart,

24
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:02,979
and the songs that they sang.

25
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,339
God is good, amen?

26
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,379
He is good all the time,

27
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:09,339
and what a blessing to know the Lord.

28
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:10,900
The songwriter said this,

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,339
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

30
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,699
I agree with the songwriter, amen?

31
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:22,699
When you hear the name Jesus, something just happens.

32
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,580
I mean, you hear the name of Jesus,

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,019
it's as if when His name is spoken,

34
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:32,620
that immediately my mind, my heart, my soul

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,620
fills with thoughts that both encourage me and comfort me.

36
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,739
The name of Jesus.

37
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,339
We have a wonderful Savior.

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,580
And we find this morning that as we look

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,300
at this portion of Scripture in 1 Peter 2,

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,120
and really just as a launching point as I mentioned,

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,419
notice in verse number one, the Bible says,

42
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:55,220
wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile

43
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,339
and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings,

44
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:02,620
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word,

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,339
that ye may grow thereby.

46
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,139
I noticed in verses one and two

47
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,820
that we're immediately confronted with the fact

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,479
that we're dealing with believers.

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,179
We're dealing with those that have trust at Christ

50
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,020
as their Savior.

51
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,520
Of course, you can find that in chapter one as well,

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,660
but you find that there's some things

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,179
that need to be laid aside according to verse number one.

54
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:24,139
There's a growth process in the Christian life,

55
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,179
and we find that detailed for us in verses one and two.

56
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:29,500
We find that in verse number three,

57
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,539
how similar the statement is to what David says

58
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,619
in Psalm 34, but notice here it says,

59
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:39,619
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

60
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,059
Aren't you thankful that our God is gracious?

61
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,860
He continues to whom coming as unto a living stone,

62
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,699
disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious.

63
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,619
Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house

64
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:58,699
and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices

65
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:02,139
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

66
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,979
Oh, if we had the time this morning to detail

67
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,539
all that is given to us in verses four and five

68
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:10,139
and understanding our position in Christ

69
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,500
and understanding because of redemption,

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,899
because of what he did on that cruel cross

71
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:17,460
and as he conquered sin, death, and the grave

72
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,539
by rising triumphantly from that borrowed tomb,

73
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,020
we find that he has told us here

74
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,220
that we're in holy priesthood,

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,500
that we're to offer up spiritual sacrifices

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,059
that are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

77
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:35,380
I mean, it's an amazing truth of God's word,

78
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,580
the transformation that takes place at salvation.

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,699
He continues and says,

80
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,580
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture,

81
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,100
behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,059
elect, precious, and he that believeth on him

83
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,860
shall not be confounded.

84
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,259
Notice verse number seven,

85
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,779
it'll be the text for our message

86
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,419
both this morning and this evening.

87
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,380
Unto you, therefore, which believe.

88
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,619
Do you believe?

89
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,979
Have you trusted Christ as your Savior?

90
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,699
The Bible says, unto you, therefore, which believe,

91
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,740
he is precious.

92
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,500
We've seen that word precious used three times.

93
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,059
We've seen it in verse number four.

94
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,500
We've seen it in verse number six.

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,019
And now we see it again in verse number seven.

96
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,420
It's amazing to me how the Lord uses

97
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,100
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,540
Peter, to write this book.

99
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,619
And in my mind, I think of Peter,

100
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:28,260
of this fisherman, I mean, a tough guy,

101
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,820
just a man of a man, so to speak,

102
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,980
and yet he's using the term precious.

103
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,820
Why?

104
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,299
Because Jesus is precious.

105
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,579
He's precious.

106
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,899
The word precious is an interesting word.

107
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,540
It carries with it the idea of that honor

108
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,339
which one has by reason of rank

109
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,459
and state of office which he holds.

110
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,739
By using the definition of this word

111
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,660
that is translated precious here

112
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,260
in our text of Scripture,

113
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,899
of the honor which one has by reason of rank,

114
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,260
he is King of kings and Lord of lords, amen?

115
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,339
He is God, it says this,

116
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,100
and state of office which he holds.

117
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,220
And you could name all sorts of things

118
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,820
about our Lord this morning,

119
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,899
but indeed, if there is a word

120
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,179
that sums up so beautifully our Savior,

121
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:23,339
it is this word, He is precious.

122
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,019
He's precious.

123
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,059
And this morning, we find that as we think

124
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,660
about the Lord Jesus Christ

125
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,579
and His name is so wonderful,

126
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,500
and definitely we agree, as the songwriter said,

127
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,019
His name, Jesus, it is the sweetest name I know.

128
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm mindful this morning of the times

129
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,380
in which Jesus, during His earthly ministry,

130
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,859
He interacted with those religious leaders of the day.

131
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,739
In John 8, they were contending with Jesus,

132
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,779
and they say in verse 53,

133
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,619
art thou greater than our father Abraham?

134
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,579
They had no idea.

135
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,540
Amen?

136
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,820
In just a little while,

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,260
He would say, before Abraham was, I am!

138
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,899
He is God.

139
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,260
He is precious.

140
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,299
We find that in Matthew 12,

141
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,700
that Jesus declares,

142
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,459
behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

143
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,660
Now you think about the place of Abraham

144
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,940
in the mind of a Jewish individual.

145
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,739
You think of the place of Solomon

146
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:23,019
and Solomon's temple and all of the beauty

147
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,660
and all of the things that would be

148
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,739
wrapped up in the mind,

149
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,619
and Jesus says, behold,

150
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,339
a greater than Solomon is here.

151
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,299
Jesus asked His disciples,

152
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,899
as it's recorded in Matthew 16,

153
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:42,299
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

154
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,980
And Peter says, well,

155
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,540
some say that you're one of the prophets.

156
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,140
Elijah.

157
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,619
John the Baptist.

158
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,019
And Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

159
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,619
And Peter stands with great confidence,

160
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,380
and he says, thou art the Christ,

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,019
the Son of the living God.

162
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,459
Man, we serve a great God.

163
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,380
He is precious.

164
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,820
This morning, we're gonna look at two thoughts.

165
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,299
This evening, we're gonna deal with a final thought.

166
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:18,980
So I hope you come back this evening

167
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,339
so you get part two of the message.

168
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,980
But part one here this morning,

169
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,820
He is precious, part one.

170
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,579
I want you to be thankful this morning

171
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,739
for His person, for who He is.

172
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,299
So often in our lives,

173
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,540
we get wrapped up in being thankful

174
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,059
and having gratitude in what someone does for us.

175
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,579
And certainly this morning,

176
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,619
there are scores of reasons

177
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,100
that we should be thankful

178
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,700
for the things that He does for us.

179
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,619
Amen?

180
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,540
But this morning, for just a few moments,

181
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,899
I want us to consider

182
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,019
that we should be thankful for His person,

183
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,299
for who He is.

184
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,739
From the book of Revelation, if you will,

185
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,940
in the first chapter,

186
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,899
and listen, we're just gonna list

187
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,739
a whole lot of things this morning.

188
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,700
I hope that you get as many of them as you can,

189
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,779
and I hope that you leave here encouraged

190
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,100
as we seek to exalt and magnify

191
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,579
the Lord Jesus Christ.

192
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,700
And since this morning,

193
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,059
the thought of my message is simply this,

194
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,019
He must increase, and we must decrease.

195
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,579
He is precious.

196
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,100
And here are some things

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,500
that we ought to be thankful for.

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,980
Number one, if you're taking notes

199
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,100
under this particular point for who He is,

200
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
He is Alpha and Omega.

201
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,339
Notice in verse number eight,

202
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,540
Jesus says, I am Alpha and Omega,

203
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,500
the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,

204
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,059
which is, and which was, and which is to come,

205
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,299
the Almighty.

206
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,219
We find that our God has no beginning and no ending.

207
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,979
We find that the Bible tells us

208
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,859
of the life of Christ

209
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,700
and the life of John the Baptist,

210
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,580
that John the Baptist testifies

211
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,219
that He was before me.

212
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,739
But earthly speaking, from a human perspective,

213
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:56,619
Jesus Christ was born physically

214
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,460
after John the Baptist.

215
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,580
Why was it that John the Baptist would say,

216
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,099
He is before me,

217
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,140
and He is preferred above me?

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,979
Why? Because of the eternality

219
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,219
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

220
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,140
He is Alpha and Omega.

221
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,539
He's the beginning and the end.

222
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,859
He is, He was, and He is to come.

223
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:16,380
And we ought to rejoice in who He is.

224
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,659
We find that also here in this verse of Scripture,

225
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,820
it says that He is Almighty.

226
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,020
Notice the very last phrase there.

227
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,500
The Almighty.

228
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,099
You think about the Lord God omnipotent reigneth,

229
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,419
the Bible tells us in Revelation 19

230
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,979
in verse 6, He is Almighty.

231
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,020
And when you begin to think about who He is,

232
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,940
and you begin to rejoice and be thankful

233
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,260
in who He is, and we are mindful this morning

234
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,979
that He has no beginning and no ending,

235
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,700
that He is Almighty,

236
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,140
that there's nothing, there's nothing,

237
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,299
no situation, no circumstance,

238
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,859
no mountain, nothing that's too hard for our God.

239
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,539
He is the Almighty.

240
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:56,900
And we ought to rejoice in that.

241
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,099
We ought to be thankful in who He is.

242
00:09:59,099 --> 00:09:59,940
By the way,

243
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,020
This evening, I'll talk about being thankful for the Bible.

244
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,940
All of these things that we find about the Lord

245
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,880
are found in His precious book, the Bible.

246
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,500
Aren't you so thankful He gave us a Bible?

247
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,720
Without it, we would not know

248
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,820
the list of things that I'll provide for you this morning.

249
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,620
He's Alpha and Omega.

250
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,740
He is Almighty.

251
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,140
He is the Creator.

252
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,700
Colossians 1, we've studied through the book of Colossians

253
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
this year in our Sunday morning services,

254
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
and we found that Colossians 1

255
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,540
probably in all of Scripture,

256
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,340
if you're gonna go to one passage of Scripture

257
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,580
to deal with the person of Jesus Christ

258
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,260
and the exalted Christ, it's here in Colossians 1,

259
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,920
in verse 15 and following,

260
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,500
you find that the Apostle Paul,

261
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,780
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

262
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,020
gives us a portrait of Jesus Christ

263
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,260
that is like no other in all of the Scriptures.

264
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,740
We find in just a few verses of Scripture,

265
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,880
He exalts Him in such an amazing way.

266
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,800
We're thinking this morning at this point

267
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
that He is Creator.

268
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,520
Notice in verse number 15,

269
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
who is the image of the invisible God,

270
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,240
the firstborn of every creature,

271
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,760
for by Him were all things created

272
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,840
that are in heaven and that are in earth,

273
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,400
visible and invisible,

274
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
whether they be thrones or dominions

275
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,160
or principalities or powers,

276
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,720
all things were created by Him and for Him.

277
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Aren't you thankful that He's the Creator?

278
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,279
Indeed, when you think about creation,

279
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,840
we understand this morning

280
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,560
that there's all kinds of debates

281
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
with regard to creation,

282
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440
and we understand this morning

283
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,100
that the enemy wants to deny the Creator

284
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,360
because if they can deny the Creator,

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
they deny their responsibility to God.

286
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,840
We see that in Romans 1,

287
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,560
but indeed, the Word of God,

288
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
it's not just exclusive to Genesis 1-3,

289
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
dealing with creation.

290
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,380
We find the record of creation

291
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,240
all throughout the Scriptures,

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,400
and we find that He is the Creator.

293
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
He is the Creator.

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,279
He is the sustainer.

295
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,319
In Hebrews 1 and verse number 3,

296
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,960
the Bible tells us this great truth

297
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,479
with regard to not only the creative work of God

298
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,839
that He is the Creator,

299
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,279
but understanding that He upholds all things,

300
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,119
that He is the sustainer of all things.

301
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,919
The Bible says this in Hebrews 1

302
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,080
and verse number 3,

303
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,119
who being the brightness of His glory

304
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,199
and the express image of His Person

305
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,559
and upholding all things

306
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,199
by the Word of His power,

307
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,839
when He had by Himself purged our sins,

308
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,639
sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,

309
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,880
and what great truth is given to us

310
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
in verse number 3,

311
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,760
not only that of creation

312
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,520
and the sustaining work of God,

313
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,559
but that of redemption as well

314
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,919
is given to us at the end of verse number 3.

315
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,919
But we find that He is the sustainer.

316
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,919
Why is it that we have the laws

317
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,639
that we have in nature?

318
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,119
It's because our God sustains all things.

319
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,800
Without Him, you remove Him

320
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,279
and it falls apart,

321
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,639
but you find that He upholds all things

322
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,400
by the Word of His power.

323
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,160
Phenomenal.

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,080
He's precious.

325
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,360
He's Alpha and Omega.

326
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,199
He's Almighty.

327
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,720
He's Creator.

328
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,839
He is the sustainer.

329
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,880
Notice He is compassionate.

330
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,600
I love the fact that you find

331
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,320
throughout the Word of God

332
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
and in Matthew 9,

333
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
we'll look there at this portion of Scripture,

334
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
but you find the compassion of Christ.

335
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,160
You find that our God is compassionate.

336
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
And here in Matthew 9,

337
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,760
the Bible tells us that there was a multitude

338
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,479
and Jesus saw the multitudes

339
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,919
in verse number 36

340
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,080
and it tells us that He was moved

341
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,600
with compassion on them.

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
Why?

343
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,119
Because they fainted and were scattered abroad

344
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,919
as sheep having no shepherd.

345
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,360
He was moved with compassion.

346
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,479
We mentioned this morning

347
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:56,680
in our Sunday school hours,

348
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,520
we're studying the miracles of Christ

349
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,080
that we were able to witness

350
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,119
the compassion of Christ

351
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:04,119
and the power of Christ.

352
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm thankful here that as you note here

353
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,000
that He's moved with compassion,

354
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,360
you find this referenced

355
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,720
in other portions of Scripture as well

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,040
that He is compassionate.

357
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
He is gracious.

358
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,799
Faith sang about God's grace this morning.

359
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,640
We understand that many of us,

360
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,920
even as we sang at the conclusion of our service

361
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,080
last Sunday morning,

362
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,119
amazing grace,

363
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,760
that we are very thankful for the grace of God.

364
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,519
In our text of Scripture in 1 Peter 2,

365
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,200
in verse number 3,

366
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,839
we read it just a moment ago,

367
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,880
and the Bible says this

368
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
with regard to the grace of God,

369
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,040
if so be that ye have tasted

370
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,239
that the Lord is gracious.

371
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,360
It's part of His nature.

372
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,679
It's who He is.

373
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,600
He's gracious.

374
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
And you think about the grace of God.

375
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
His saving grace.

376
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,200
His serving grace.

377
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,839
And you find that we sing about His amazing grace.

378
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,880
Paul speaks about His abundant grace.

379
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,000
And you find that as we understand

380
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,279
the grace of God,

381
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,799
and we understand this morning

382
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,080
that we have been the recipients of His grace.

383
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,160
For by grace are you saved through faith.

384
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480
And that not of yourselves,

385
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,839
it is the gift of God,

386
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,679
but not of works,

387
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,880
lest any man should boast.

388
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Oh, the grace of God.

389
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
How precious our God is.

390
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,600
He's merciful.

391
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,239
Grace and mercy are often used together.

392
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,679
And we find that when you speak

393
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,360
of these two attributes of our God,

394
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,040
that yes, indeed, they are similar,

395
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,600
yet there are contrasts between the two.

396
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,119
God giving us what we do not deserve

397
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,640
in one aspect,

398
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,080
and then God not giving us

399
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,279
what we do deserve.

400
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,119
Turn over to Ephesians 2.

401
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:53,679
The reality is that we deserve punishment.

402
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,959
Listen, we are guilty.

403
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:56,880
Amen?

404
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
We're sinners. We're guilty.

405
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,799
The reality is that Paul begins

406
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,480
this great passage of Scripture

407
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
by speaking about those that were saved,

408
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,119
but he reminds them of their past.

409
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,000
In Ephesians 2 and verse 1,

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
"...and you hath He quickened

411
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,080
who were dead in trespasses and sins."

412
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,119
By the way, we were dead

413
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:20,600
in our trespasses and sins.

414
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,880
"...you hath He quickened."

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,519
If you've been born again this morning,

416
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,119
if you've trusted Jesus Christ

417
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,000
as your personal Savior this morning,

418
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,760
you've been made alive.

419
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,279
You were dead spiritually.

420
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,119
He says this,

421
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,600
"...wherein in time past

422
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,360
ye walked according to the course of this world.

423
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,480
According to the Prince of the power of the air,

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
the Spirit that now worketh

425
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,559
on the children of disobedience,

426
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,440
among whom also we all had our conversation

427
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
in times past in the lust of our flesh."

428
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,080
Can we identify with what's being said?

429
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,559
There was a time in your life

430
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,600
that you were not saved.

431
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,880
And that time in your life when you were not saved

432
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,360
is described here that we all

433
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,040
were in this same condition in time past.

434
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,320
We're following the lust of our flesh.

435
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,239
"...fulfilling the desires of the flesh

436
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,320
and of the mind,

437
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,279
for we're by nature the children of wrath

438
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,559
even as others."

439
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,959
But God.

440
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,600
But God.

441
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,760
"...who is rich in mercy

442
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
for His great love

443
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
wherewith He loved us."

444
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,320
Aren't you thankful for the mercy of God?

445
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,559
He's merciful.

446
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,600
Who He is.

447
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,320
As we look at these,

448
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,440
just a list of things that I've put together

449
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,200
to encourage my heart,

450
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,320
to trust that it would be an encouragement

451
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,519
to your heart as well,

452
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,080
that we're mindful this morning,

453
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,600
we're thankful for His Person,

454
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,559
for who He is.

455
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,880
Yes, that I'm a recipient of His grace,

456
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,959
and yes, that I'm a recipient of His mercy,

457
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,320
but why am I a recipient?

458
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,559
Because that's what He is.

459
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,119
That's who He is.

460
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,119
It's part of His very nature.

461
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,679
He's gracious.

462
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,480
And He's merciful.

463
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,760
We find that He's long-suffering.

464
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,200
Aren't you thankful that our God is long-suffering?

465
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,760
Often times in our lives,

466
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
we enjoy the long-suffering of God.

467
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,600
2 Peter 3.

468
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
There are times, however,

469
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,000
when others perhaps may be enjoying

470
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
the long-suffering of God

471
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,040
that we don't seem to understand

472
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,239
why God isn't dealing with them.

473
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,440
But when God's being long-suffering to us,

474
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,880
oh, we're so grateful for His long-suffering.

475
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,080
I've often said over the years

476
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,039
that we ought never mistake

477
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,039
the long-suffering of God for His permission.

478
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,080
God's never okay with sin. Never.

479
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,799
But God is long-suffering to us.

480
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,359
He's patient with us.

481
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,320
And you begin to think here,

482
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,200
the Bible within the context of 2 Peter 3

483
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,559
is speaking of His promise

484
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,880
with regard to His coming,

485
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,479
but it says,

486
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,520
"...the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

487
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
as some men cannot slacken His notice,

488
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,280
but is long-suffering to us-ward,

489
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
not willing that any should perish,

490
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,520
but that all should come to repentance."

491
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,239
I'm thankful that God is long-suffering.

492
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,080
We sing a song with the children

493
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,880
about God created all things.

494
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,200
And He created all things in just six days.

495
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,919
You go through all of the various aspects of creation,

496
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,359
but then the song deals with,

497
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,599
but He's still working on me.

498
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,799
And He is! He's still working on us.

499
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,760
He's long-suffering to us-ward.

500
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,159
He's patient with us.

501
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,840
By the way, aren't you thankful

502
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,479
that He is long-suffering?

503
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,000
He's not becoming any of these things.

504
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
He is all of these things.

505
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,080
He is precious.

506
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,640
He's long-suffering to us.

507
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,919
I believe, as I mentioned earlier,

508
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,280
as I gave you the definition of precious

509
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,440
and spoke about the office or rank

510
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
that one holds.

511
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,480
I've made this statement that He is King of kings

512
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,060
and Lord of lords.

513
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,500
The Bible tells us in Psalm 2,

514
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
if you turn back over there just for a moment

515
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,680
in how prophetic this particular portion of Scripture is

516
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
even for the day in which we're living.

517
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,840
In Psalm 2,

518
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,040
the Bible speaks here with regard

519
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,480
to the kings of the earth.

520
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,560
In Psalm 2, in verse 1, it says,

521
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,200
why do the heathen rage

522
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,440
and the people imagine a vain thing?

523
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,880
The kings of the earth set themselves

524
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,600
and the rulers take counsel together

525
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,120
against who?

526
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,760
Against the Lord!

527
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,520
And against His anointed saying,

528
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,800
let us break their bands asunder

529
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,560
and cast away their cords from us.

530
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,280
Listen, we're living in a time

531
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,600
where there's so much prophetic nature

532
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,120
of this particular portion of Scripture.

533
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
The kings of the earth set themselves,

534
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,120
the rulers take counsel together

535
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,720
against the Lord and against His anointed,

536
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,560
but He, verse 4,

537
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,560
that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.

538
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,480
The Lord shall have them in derision.

539
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,520
Why does He laugh?

540
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,440
Because He's King of kings and Lord of lords.

541
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
No one's ever going to conquer Him.

542
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,639
No one's going to defeat Him.

543
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,720
No one's going to alter His plan.

544
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,400
His plan will be fulfilled

545
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
exactly as He has told us it will be fulfilled.

546
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,080
He is King of kings, Lord of lords,

547
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,720
the only potentate.

548
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
We find that there are men,

549
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,639
there are people upon this earth

550
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:41,080
that have titles and have positions

551
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,000
and we find that the Bible says in Proverbs

552
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
that the heart of the king is where?

553
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,520
It's in the hand of the Lord.

554
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,420
And He turns it however He desires

555
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,800
because He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

556
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,600
All the kings of the earth,

557
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,959
they can set themselves against the Lord

558
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,639
and they can come up with their plans

559
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:02,080
and they can devise all that they want to devise,

560
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,020
but He is not in their hand.

561
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,860
Amen?

562
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,319
Listen, we ought to be thankful for that this morning.

563
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,440
We ought to be thankful that He is King of kings

564
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,800
and Lord of lords,

565
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,400
that He is the great I Am.

566
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,199
Let me say this, He is victorious.

567
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,600
He never loses.

568
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,199
Never.

569
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,279
He is victorious.

570
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,760
Satan thought he defeated Him, did he not?

571
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,000
Pilate and all the Romans, the Jews,

572
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,320
gave all the instruction with making that grave

573
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,520
as sure, as secure as they could.

574
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,440
Didn't matter what they did at that grave.

575
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
As we sing on Easter morn,

576
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
up from the grave He arose.

577
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,800
Amen?

578
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,680
He is victorious.

579
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Notice back in the Old Testament, if you will,

580
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,360
1 Chronicles 29,

581
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,440
I love the way that this particular portion of Scripture

582
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,559
is the wording here.

583
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,559
And what a joy when you think about the greatness

584
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,820
and the power of our God.

585
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,360
And in 1 Chronicles 29, in verse number 11,

586
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
just a powerful verse of Scripture,

587
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,600
perhaps a verse that you'd like to commit to memory

588
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,040
and to be encouraged by the truth contained therein.

589
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,600
The Bible says in 1 Chronicles 29, in verse number 11,

590
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,919
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power

591
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,040
and the glory and the victory and the majesty

592
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,919
for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine.

593
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,320
Thine is the kingdom, O Lord,

594
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,320
and Thou art exalted as head above all.

595
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,040
Isn't that a powerful verse of Scripture?

596
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,119
I mean, you ought to memorize that verse of Scripture.

597
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,160
Seriously.

598
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,320
You see what, as David is worshiping,

599
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,880
as David is giving the offering

600
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,400
and as they're worshiping here,

601
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,760
he gives us under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

602
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,760
this great truth with regard to who our God is.

603
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,360
Isaiah 25.

604
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,559
Notice here in this portion of Scripture

605
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,800
when we think about the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ

606
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,880
and we think about Him conquering sin, death, and the grave.

607
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Isaiah 25 is prophetic, no doubt.

608
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,920
As we look at the truth of Isaiah 25 in verse number 8

609
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,360
and we find that Paul will use this portion of Scripture

610
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,440
at the end of 1 Corinthians 15,

611
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
but here in Isaiah 25 in verse number 8,

612
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,279
the Bible says He will swallow up death in what?

613
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,399
In victory.

614
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,160
The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces

615
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,519
and the rebuke of His people

616
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,959
shall He take away from off all the earth

617
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,640
for the Lord hath spoken it.

618
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,279
Aren't those good words at the end of verse number 8?

619
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:55,399
For the Lord hath spoken it.

620
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,080
What He says, He does.

621
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Always.

622
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,640
And here we find that the first aspect

623
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
of this verse of Scripture when it says

624
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,080
He will swallow up death in victory.

625
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,200
Again, we see that Paul references this

626
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,920
in 1 Corinthians 15 in verse 54, 55, 56,

627
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,959
and then you come to verse 57,

628
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,880
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

629
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,119
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

630
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,360
And what's the chapter of 1 Corinthians 15,

631
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,239
what's it all about?

632
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,959
It's about the resurrection.

633
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,440
If there's one place in all of God's word

634
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,519
that you wanna run to in understanding the resurrection

635
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,040
and the blessedness of the truth

636
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,040
that then impacts us as the hope of the resurrection

637
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,480
is 1 Corinthians 15.

638
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
It's the chapter that deals with the resurrection

639
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,040
like no other chapter.

640
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,799
And we find that He is victorious.

641
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,519
Listen, He swallowed up death in victory.

642
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,720
We can read in Hebrews chapter number two.

643
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,480
We can read in 1 John how that He destroyed the enemy,

644
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,799
the devil who had the power of death,

645
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,720
how that He destroyed him.

646
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,640
How did He do that?

647
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,959
On the cross.

648
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,519
In the very place where the enemy thought He had Him.

649
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
But He proved to be victorious.

650
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,920
Our God is victorious.

651
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
He always is.

652
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,239
He always wins.

653
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,640
He never fails.

654
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,679
He is victorious.

655
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,720
The Curtis Hudson used to sing all the time

656
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,160
at the end of messages, I mean regularly,

657
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,720
he would sing, I'm on the winning side.

658
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,880
And he'd sing that wonderful song

659
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,920
and he'd talk about being on the winning side.

660
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,640
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

661
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,600
that I'm on the winning side.

662
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,920
I've read the book of Revelation, amen?

663
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,239
And guess what?

664
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,440
We're victors.

665
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,399
We're conquerors.

666
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,160
We're more than conquerors through Christ.

667
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,640
He is victorious and because He is victorious

668
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,559
and because I am His, I too can be victorious.

669
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,160
The book of Joshua is not a picture of going to heaven.

670
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,160
Some have purported that over the years.

671
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,600
But the book of Joshua is a picture

672
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,440
of the victorious Christian life.

673
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,360
There's death in the book of Joshua.

674
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,600
There's war in the book of Joshua.

675
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,160
There's not gonna be war or death in heaven, amen?

676
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,640
So it's not a picture of heaven.

677
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
It's a picture, however, of the victorious Christian life.

678
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,399
And oh, how we can have victory

679
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,119
because He is victorious.

680
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,600
He is faithful.

681
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
He is faithful.

682
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,760
Faithful is He that calleth you who also will do it

683
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,959
is what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 24.

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
But I wanna draw your attention

685
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,760
to what the Bible says in Revelation 19.

686
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,399
In Revelation 19, this portion of scripture

687
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,200
gives us a glimpse as to the second coming of Christ

688
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,160
at the end of the tribulation period,

689
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,440
not when He just comes in the air at the rapture

690
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,959
to take the church with Him,

691
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,839
but at the end of the tribulation period

692
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,760
when He comes all the way back to the earth

693
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,720
and He's going to establish His millennial kingdom.

694
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,679
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 11,

695
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,519
and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse

696
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,519
and He that sat upon Him was called Faithful and True.

697
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,959
And in righteousness He doth judge and make war.

698
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,839
His eyes was a flame of fire

699
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,559
and on His head were many crowns

700
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,959
and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself.

701
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:29,040
He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood

702
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,440
and His name is called the Word of God.

703
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,799
The armies which were in heaven

704
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,239
followed Him upon white horses,

705
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,159
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

706
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,760
You know what?

707
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I'm gonna be there.

708
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
I'm gonna be on one of those horses.

709
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,880
Amen?

710
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,760
And if you've been saved, you are too.

711
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,359
I told Holly just a little while ago,

712
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,840
I can't remember, just a couple of weeks ago,

713
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,080
I said, you know, horseback riding is one of those things

714
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,359
that I'm thankful I checked it off of my list,

715
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,039
but really I have no interest in ever doing it again.

716
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,619
Some of you like horseback riding and I'm not against it,

717
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,720
it's just not what I was comfortable with.

718
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,960
But I did it, it's off my list.

719
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,880
I've done it one time

720
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,679
and I'm happy to have been able to do it.

721
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,859
But there's coming a day that I'm gonna ride a horse.

722
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,720
I'm glad I'm not gonna be in this body.

723
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,559
Amen?

724
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,159
But I'm gonna ride a horse.

725
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,599
It's gonna be exciting.

726
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,960
The Bible says that the armies which were in heaven

727
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,000
followed Him upon white horses,

728
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,320
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

729
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,679
Out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword

730
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,679
that with it He should smite the nations

731
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,720
and He shall rule them with a rod of iron

732
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,760
and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

733
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,720
and wrath of Almighty God

734
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,720
and He hath on His vesture and on His thigh

735
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,440
a name written King of kings and Lord of lords.

736
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,359
In verse number 11 it says that His name

737
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,840
was called Faithful and True.

738
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,900
I'm thankful that my God is faithful.

739
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,919
He's faithful.

740
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,419
He's trustworthy.

741
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,520
He's dependable.

742
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,119
We've mentioned that He's victorious, He never fails.

743
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,919
We sing this morning about Him.

744
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,019
Now, great is thy faithfulness.

745
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,639
And oh, how we ought to be thankful

746
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,319
that our God is faithful.

747
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,919
He is wonderful.

748
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,759
Joy Clemens sang a song

749
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,579
when she was here a number of years ago.

750
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,179
The song, I think it was titled,

751
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,599
He is More Than Wonderful.

752
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,599
I mean, when all that we can imagine,

753
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:29,059
all that we can wrap our minds around

754
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,399
by studying this book

755
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,139
and conclude that He's wonderful,

756
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,339
the reality is that He's more than wonderful.

757
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,079
I stood in that foyer years ago

758
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,379
and I said to an individual,

759
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,499
they were struggling and asking questions,

760
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,219
and I said, listen, let me ask you this morning,

761
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,759
in your mind, in your heart,

762
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,539
in your mind this morning,

763
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,379
how great is God?

764
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,959
And they gave me an answer.

765
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,619
And I said, with all due respect, He's greater.

766
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,539
Why?

767
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,339
Because our mind cannot fully comprehend Him.

768
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,399
He transcends us.

769
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,159
My finite mind cannot comprehend

770
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,279
an infinite God.

771
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,259
But I can agree with 1 Peter 2

772
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,359
in verse 7,

773
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,179
when the Bible says,

774
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,759
unto you therefore which believe,

775
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,179
He is precious.

776
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,259
I say, I agree with that.

777
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,319
I've believed on Him.

778
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,059
I've put my faith and trust in Him.

779
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,159
And He is precious.

780
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,859
This morning, we're going to be thankful

781
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,199
for His Person, for who He is.

782
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,519
This morning, we're going to be thankful

783
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,739
for His presence.

784
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,559
Not only for His Person, for who He is,

785
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,259
but for His presence.

786
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:43,139
I'm so thankful.

787
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:46,619
The Bible tells us that He is with us.

788
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,459
What joy and comfort,

789
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:51,219
what peace floods my soul

790
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:52,479
when I consider this morning

791
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,799
the presence of God Almighty.

792
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,419
Notice, if you will, back in Psalm 23.

793
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,679
We're just going to look at a few more verses.

794
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,599
Psalm 23, it's a very familiar psalm.

795
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:15,139
One in which we have heard many times.

796
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,419
We want to be mindful of the presence of God,

797
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:19,059
the presence of My Shepherd

798
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:20,839
as it's mentioned in verse 4.

799
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:23,439
Yea, though I walk through the valley

800
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,319
of the shadow of death,

801
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,739
I will fear no evil.

802
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,239
Why?

803
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,299
For Thou art with Me.

804
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,599
Thy rod, Thy staff,

805
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,039
they comfort Me.

806
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,839
The presence of the Shepherd

807
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,319
says to the sheep,

808
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,159
I will fear no evil,

809
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,119
because you're with Me.

810
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,759
You're with Me.

811
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,499
Notice in Psalm 139.

812
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,619
And really, you could look at a number of verses

813
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:56,819
throughout Psalm 139

814
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:01,359
dealing with the presence of God.

815
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,659
But I'm just going to look at one verse of Scripture

816
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,119
and it's really a question,

817
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,259
but it's an obvious answer to the question.

818
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,199
If you read the following verses,

819
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,219
you'll understand it.

820
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:15,379
But in Psalm 139 in verse 7,

821
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:15,919
it says,

822
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,599
Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?

823
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,199
For whither shall I flee from Thy presence?

824
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:27,819
Hebrews 13 and verse 5

825
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,259
tells us that we're to be content

826
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,439
with such things we have.

827
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,599
And then it tells us this,

828
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,759
for He hath saith,

829
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,239
I will never leave Thee,

830
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,279
nor forsake Thee.

831
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,919
I will never leave Thee, nor forsake Thee.

832
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,359
What a precious truth of the Word of God.

833
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,639
And this morning when I think about His presence,

834
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,479
I'm mindful of His person

835
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,679
and I rejoice greatly

836
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,919
and I'm thankful for who He is.

837
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:53,199
But then when I think about His presence,

838
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,059
I'm going to take you on a journey

839
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,959
through the Scriptures here just for a moment.

840
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,559
We're not going to turn to any passages.

841
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,679
We've turned to enough.

842
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,039
Our time is short.

843
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,359
But I want you to just think about

844
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:07,039
these biblical accounts for just a moment.

845
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,599
And I want you to consider with me

846
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,679
the presence of God.

847
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,279
And I want to challenge you this morning

848
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,119
with the list that I've provided,

849
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,919
I want to challenge you to

850
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,119
go find some other references.

851
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,399
Go find some other truths

852
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,599
within the Word of God

853
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,439
where we consider the presence of God.

854
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:31,159
It was God who was in the ark with Noah.

855
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,279
In fact, when you read,

856
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:35,919
the Bible says that God says,

857
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,439
come into the ark.

858
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:43,159
Come into the ark.

859
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,839
That's significant.

860
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,519
It doesn't even say go into the ark.

861
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,799
Amen?

862
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:52,679
Come into the ark.

863
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,199
Because He's there.

864
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,399
Because God is there.

865
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:59,559
Noah and his wife and his three sons

866
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:03,399
and their wives and all the animals.

867
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,279
But God was there.

868
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,919
God was in that ark with Noah.

869
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:11,439
God was in the pit with Joseph

870
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,559
when his brothers wanted to kill Him.

871
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,759
And then Reuben says,

872
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,959
let's just throw Him in the pit.

873
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:16,879
And He throws Him in the pit

874
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,639
and they're trying to figure out

875
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,639
what they're going to do.

876
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,719
It was God who was in the pit with Joseph.

877
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,599
It was God that was in the prison with Joseph

878
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,759
after He's brought up out of that pit

879
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,439
and after He's sold into slavery

880
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:31,359
and we find that He's purchased

881
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,839
and He's there and He's in Potiphar's home

882
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,239
and we find that there are false accusations

883
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,319
that are made against Him

884
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,639
and with those false accusations,

885
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:44,279
the sentence is given to prison you go.

886
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:48,999
It was God that was with Joseph in the prison.

887
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,599
As awful as the pit and the prison are,

888
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,919
I would submit to you this morning

889
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:56,879
that it was God who was with Joseph in the palace.

890
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:59,959
Because just as God is with us in the hard times,

891
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,599
He's with us in the good times.

892
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,639
And just as Joseph went from the pit to the prison,

893
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,999
He also went to the palace,

894
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,239
but it was God that was with Him in the palace.

895
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,439
You see the character and the behavior,

896
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:16,119
the nature of Joseph and you understand

897
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,319
that Joseph was a man that lived in the presence of God.

898
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:22,079
Joseph was a man that understood

899
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,639
though he was in Egypt,

900
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,839
he lived in the very presence of God Almighty.

901
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:30,199
It was God who was in the wilderness with Moses.

902
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,599
It was God who was there

903
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,239
that was providing the leadership.

904
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,319
Remember that as Moses would be the human individual,

905
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:39,879
the person that would be responsible

906
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,479
for leading the children of Israel

907
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,559
through the wilderness,

908
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,559
it was God who was leading them.

909
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,919
It was that pillar of cloud by day

910
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:49,119
and it was the pillar of fire by night.

911
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,439
It was God who led them.

912
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,599
Though they would complain and they would murmur

913
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,439
and they would say,

914
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,039
Moses, why did you bring us here?

915
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,799
The reality is that he was following God.

916
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,959
It was God that was with him in the wilderness.

917
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,799
We sing the song,

918
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:06,399
my Lord knows the way through the wilderness.

919
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:09,439
All you have to do is follow.

920
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:13,759
It was God who was with Moses there in the wilderness.

921
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:17,439
It was God who was in the land of promise with Joshua.

922
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,959
You remember at the beginning

923
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,039
of all that was taking place

924
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,359
as Joshua has got the responsibility

925
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,039
and God is encouraging him

926
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,519
and God is telling him

927
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,199
that he's going to give him the land

928
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,679
and that he's going to be with him

929
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,359
and all that takes place

930
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,439
and you come to the latter part of the fifth chapter

931
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,239
and you find that Joshua comes

932
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,279
and he's over there by Jericho

933
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,279
and he's looking and it says that he comes

934
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,559
and he says to this one,

935
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,399
art thou for us or for our adversaries?

936
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,599
The captain of the Lord's army was the Lord.

937
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,439
He says,

938
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:54,199
nay, but as captain of the host of the Lord

939
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,119
am I now come

940
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,039
and Joshua fell on his face to the earth.

941
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,239
It was God who was with Joshua

942
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,399
in that land of promise.

943
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:05,639
It was God who was with David in the wilderness

944
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,079
when he's fleeing,

945
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,799
he's running and Saul has made him his continual enemy

946
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,839
and Saul is seeking David

947
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,879
through all the thousands of Israel.

948
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,959
It was God who was with him.

949
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,159
It was God who was with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego

950
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,679
in that fiery furnace.

951
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,719
We're mindful of Daniel three

952
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,039
and we read and we rejoice in what took place

953
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,079
and we find that Nebuchadnezzar says,

954
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,440
hey, how many did we put in that fire?

955
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,479
Three that were bound.

956
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,880
But there are four that are walking around

957
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,279
and the fourth is like the Son of God.

958
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:46,880
It was God who was in that fiery furnace

959
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,279
with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

960
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:51,479
It was God and just a few chapters later

961
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,519
that was with Daniel in that den of lions.

962
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,039
It was God who was with Jeremiah

963
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,760
when he was in the dungeon,

964
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,479
when he was in the pit.

965
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,760
It was God who was with Jeremiah.

966
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,000
It was God who was with Peter

967
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,719
when he was in prison, fast asleep.

968
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,519
The church is praying.

969
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,200
It was God who was with them.

970
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,959
It was God who was with Paul and Silas

971
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:18,359
when they were in prison there in Philippi.

972
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,059
Listen this morning, God is with you.

973
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,359
God is with you.

974
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,399
He's promised His presence.

975
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:29,079
And this morning, we could go on and on

976
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,159
with illustration after illustration,

977
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:34,519
account after account of the very presence of God

978
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,359
and how God has promised His presence to His people

979
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,479
this morning.

980
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,200
As we think about this Thanksgiving week,

981
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,559
we say He is precious, He is.

982
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,479
He is precious.

983
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:53,519
I'm thankful this morning for His person, for who He is.

984
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,039
I won't repeat all of those things

985
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,599
but I'm so thankful for who He is.

986
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,959
By the way, you can add to that list as well.

987
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:07,999
well. These lists are not exhaustive. We'd be here a lot longer, and then we'd still

988
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:15,319
miss some things, right? For his person, I'm thankful this morning for his presence. He'll

989
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:24,439
never leave me nor forsake me. Paul said this, everyone left me, but the Lord stood with

990
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:33,239
me. Man, the presence of God. You think about all of those accounts that we briefly referenced.

991
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:40,519
God was with them. And this morning, God is with you. Think about all the things that

992
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:45,239
we deal with in life, and you think of all the trials and tribulations. Oh, if we could

993
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,199
just change our attention for just a little while, more than just the week of Thanksgiving,

994
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:58,639
by the way, but just let's change our attention to He is precious. Just get filled up and

995
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:08,199
overwhelmed with the person, who He is. Begin to rejoice in His presence. This evening,

996
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:14,839
we're going to look at His promises. I hope that you'd come back. Again, could not be

997
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:20,079
an exhaustive list, but I'm going to give you 15 promises this evening that are to

998
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:29,679
cause us to rejoice greatly. I agree. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. I've believed,

999
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:39,139
and I agree. He is precious. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank

1000
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:48,819
you for this book, the Bible. I thank you for how you have given us a portrait of who

1001
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:55,139
you are. I know, as I've already admitted publicly this morning, that we could never

1002
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:06,619
fully comprehend who you are. I agree with the psalmist when he says, I know the Lord

1003
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:16,039
is great. Then later on, no contradiction, however, he says the greatness of God is unsearchable.

1004
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:23,339
I know you're great, but we just simply scratch the surface of your greatness. I pray this

1005
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:30,059
morning that you'd help us to just get our attention focused upon thee. Help us to be

1006
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:36,819
thankful for your person, for who you are. Help us to be thankful for your presence.

1007
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:43,339
There's one that's not sure of heaven. God, it's our prayer that today they'd be saved.

1008
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:52,979
They don't know who Jesus is. They've not believed, and therefore they've not concluded

1009
00:42:53,019 --> 00:43:02,019
that he's precious. Today is the day of salvation. There'd be one that's in that condition. Oh,

1010
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:05,899
God, would you move and work, draw them to yourself as only you can. Pray that the Holy

1011
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:12,899
Spirit of God would convict of sin and judgment of Christ's righteousness. I pray, Father,

1012
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:21,379
that you'd be with each of your people here this morning. Would you help us to just get

1013
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:29,619
our eyes upon you and say, as the psalmist said in Psalm 33, I stand in awe of you.

1014
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:32,659
Move and work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with

1015
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:38,219
me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. It's our custom to have an invitation at the end

1016
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:42,659
of our services to give you an opportunity to respond. Perhaps you want to come to this

1017
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,379
old-fashioned altar and just thank God for who he is, for the book that he gave us that

1018
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:53,379
provides to us these great truths. Maybe this morning you're not sure of heaven, and

1019
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:56,919
we could take a Bible and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home.

1020
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:58,939
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
