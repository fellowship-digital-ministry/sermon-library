WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
and we'll get back to the Book of Colossians.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.079
We will finish it up this year,

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:06.360
but thinking about Thanksgiving,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.520
this upcoming week on Thursday,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.720
and seeking the Lord with regard to direction for message.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.180
And I hope that between this morning and this evening,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.920
that you will leave church today

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.559
with a whole list of reasons to rejoice, amen?

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.120
And so get your fingers ready.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.479
We're gonna begin here in 1 Peter 2.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.280
It's just gonna be our launching spot,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.639
and we'll look at a number of passages of scripture

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.959
throughout the morning and this evening as well.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:34.680
And I am so thankful for the Word of God, amen?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.840
And we have much to be thankful for.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799
The Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.880
and we ought to have a song in our hearts.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.560
We ought to have praise on our lips.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.400
The Bible says, let everything that hath breath,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.299
praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord, amen?

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.240
And man, I was encouraged by the children this morning,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.259
memorizing Psalm 100,

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.139
and what a blessing to hide the Word of God in your heart,

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:02.979
and the songs that they sang.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.339
God is good, amen?

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.379
He is good all the time,

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.339
and what a blessing to know the Lord.

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:10.900
The songwriter said this,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.339
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.699
I agree with the songwriter, amen?

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:22.699
When you hear the name Jesus, something just happens.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.580
I mean, you hear the name of Jesus,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.019
it's as if when His name is spoken,

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:32.620
that immediately my mind, my heart, my soul

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.620
fills with thoughts that both encourage me and comfort me.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.739
The name of Jesus.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.339
We have a wonderful Savior.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580
And we find this morning that as we look

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.300
at this portion of Scripture in 1 Peter 2,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.120
and really just as a launching point as I mentioned,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.419
notice in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.220
wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.339
and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings,

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:02.620
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.339
that ye may grow thereby.

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:06.139
I noticed in verses one and two

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.820
that we're immediately confronted with the fact

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.479
that we're dealing with believers.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.179
We're dealing with those that have trust at Christ

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:14.020
as their Savior.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.520
Of course, you can find that in chapter one as well,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.660
but you find that there's some things

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.179
that need to be laid aside according to verse number one.

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.139
There's a growth process in the Christian life,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.179
and we find that detailed for us in verses one and two.

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.500
We find that in verse number three,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.539
how similar the statement is to what David says

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.619
in Psalm 34, but notice here it says,

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.619
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.059
Aren't you thankful that our God is gracious?

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.860
He continues to whom coming as unto a living stone,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.699
disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.619
Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:58.699
and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.139
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.979
Oh, if we had the time this morning to detail

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.539
all that is given to us in verses four and five

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.139
and understanding our position in Christ

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.500
and understanding because of redemption,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.899
because of what he did on that cruel cross

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.460
and as he conquered sin, death, and the grave

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.539
by rising triumphantly from that borrowed tomb,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.020
we find that he has told us here

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.220
that we're in holy priesthood,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.500
that we're to offer up spiritual sacrifices

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.059
that are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.380
I mean, it's an amazing truth of God's word,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.580
the transformation that takes place at salvation.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.699
He continues and says,

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.580
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.100
behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.059
elect, precious, and he that believeth on him

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.860
shall not be confounded.

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.259
Notice verse number seven,

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:52.779
it'll be the text for our message

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:54.419
both this morning and this evening.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.380
Unto you, therefore, which believe.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.619
Do you believe?

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.979
Have you trusted Christ as your Savior?

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.699
The Bible says, unto you, therefore, which believe,

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.740
he is precious.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.500
We've seen that word precious used three times.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.059
We've seen it in verse number four.

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.500
We've seen it in verse number six.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.019
And now we see it again in verse number seven.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.420
It's amazing to me how the Lord uses

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.100
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.540
Peter, to write this book.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.619
And in my mind, I think of Peter,

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:28.260
of this fisherman, I mean, a tough guy,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.820
just a man of a man, so to speak,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.980
and yet he's using the term precious.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.820
Why?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.299
Because Jesus is precious.

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.579
He's precious.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:40.899
The word precious is an interesting word.

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.540
It carries with it the idea of that honor

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.339
which one has by reason of rank

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.459
and state of office which he holds.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.739
By using the definition of this word

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:55.660
that is translated precious here

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.260
in our text of Scripture,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.899
of the honor which one has by reason of rank,

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.260
he is King of kings and Lord of lords, amen?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.339
He is God, it says this,

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.100
and state of office which he holds.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.220
And you could name all sorts of things

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.820
about our Lord this morning,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.899
but indeed, if there is a word

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.179
that sums up so beautifully our Savior,

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:23.339
it is this word, He is precious.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.019
He's precious.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.059
And this morning, we find that as we think

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.660
about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.579
and His name is so wonderful,

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.500
and definitely we agree, as the songwriter said,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.019
His name, Jesus, it is the sweetest name I know.

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:39.100
I'm mindful this morning of the times

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.380
in which Jesus, during His earthly ministry,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.859
He interacted with those religious leaders of the day.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.739
In John 8, they were contending with Jesus,

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:51.779
and they say in verse 53,

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.619
art thou greater than our father Abraham?

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.579
They had no idea.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:58.540
Amen?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.820
In just a little while,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.260
He would say, before Abraham was, I am!

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.899
He is God.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.260
He is precious.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.299
We find that in Matthew 12,

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.700
that Jesus declares,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.459
behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.660
Now you think about the place of Abraham

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.940
in the mind of a Jewish individual.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.739
You think of the place of Solomon

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:23.019
and Solomon's temple and all of the beauty

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.660
and all of the things that would be

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.739
wrapped up in the mind,

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:28.619
and Jesus says, behold,

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:31.339
a greater than Solomon is here.

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.299
Jesus asked His disciples,

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:37.899
as it's recorded in Matthew 16,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:42.299
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.980
And Peter says, well,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.540
some say that you're one of the prophets.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.140
Elijah.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.619
John the Baptist.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.019
And Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.619
And Peter stands with great confidence,

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.380
and he says, thou art the Christ,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.019
the Son of the living God.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.459
Man, we serve a great God.

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:12.380
He is precious.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.820
This morning, we're gonna look at two thoughts.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.299
This evening, we're gonna deal with a final thought.

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:18.980
So I hope you come back this evening

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.339
so you get part two of the message.

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.980
But part one here this morning,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.820
He is precious, part one.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.579
I want you to be thankful this morning

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.739
for His person, for who He is.

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:31.299
So often in our lives,

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.540
we get wrapped up in being thankful

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.059
and having gratitude in what someone does for us.

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:39.579
And certainly this morning,

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:42.619
there are scores of reasons

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:44.100
that we should be thankful

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.700
for the things that He does for us.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.619
Amen?

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.540
But this morning, for just a few moments,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.899
I want us to consider

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.019
that we should be thankful for His person,

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:56.299
for who He is.

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.739
From the book of Revelation, if you will,

00:07:57.739 --> 00:07:58.940
in the first chapter,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.899
and listen, we're just gonna list

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.739
a whole lot of things this morning.

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:04.700
I hope that you get as many of them as you can,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.779
and I hope that you leave here encouraged

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:09.100
as we seek to exalt and magnify

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.579
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.700
And since this morning,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.059
the thought of my message is simply this,

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:18.019
He must increase, and we must decrease.

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.579
He is precious.

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:21.100
And here are some things

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.500
that we ought to be thankful for.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.980
Number one, if you're taking notes

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.100
under this particular point for who He is,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.100
He is Alpha and Omega.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.339
Notice in verse number eight,

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:31.540
Jesus says, I am Alpha and Omega,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.500
the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.059
which is, and which was, and which is to come,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.299
the Almighty.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.219
We find that our God has no beginning and no ending.

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:43.979
We find that the Bible tells us

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.859
of the life of Christ

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.700
and the life of John the Baptist,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.580
that John the Baptist testifies

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.219
that He was before me.

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:53.739
But earthly speaking, from a human perspective,

00:08:53.739 --> 00:08:56.619
Jesus Christ was born physically

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.460
after John the Baptist.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.580
Why was it that John the Baptist would say,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.099
He is before me,

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:04.140
and He is preferred above me?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.979
Why? Because of the eternality

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:07.219
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:09.140
He is Alpha and Omega.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.539
He's the beginning and the end.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.859
He is, He was, and He is to come.

00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:16.380
And we ought to rejoice in who He is.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.659
We find that also here in this verse of Scripture,

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.820
it says that He is Almighty.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.020
Notice the very last phrase there.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.500
The Almighty.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.099
You think about the Lord God omnipotent reigneth,

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:31.419
the Bible tells us in Revelation 19

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.979
in verse 6, He is Almighty.

00:09:33.979 --> 00:09:36.020
And when you begin to think about who He is,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.940
and you begin to rejoice and be thankful

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.260
in who He is, and we are mindful this morning

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.979
that He has no beginning and no ending,

00:09:41.979 --> 00:09:43.700
that He is Almighty,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.140
that there's nothing, there's nothing,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.299
no situation, no circumstance,

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:52.859
no mountain, nothing that's too hard for our God.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.539
He is the Almighty.

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:56.900
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.099
We ought to be thankful in who He is.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:09:59.940
By the way,

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.020
This evening, I'll talk about being thankful for the Bible.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.940
All of these things that we find about the Lord

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.880
are found in His precious book, the Bible.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.500
Aren't you so thankful He gave us a Bible?

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.720
Without it, we would not know

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.820
the list of things that I'll provide for you this morning.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.620
He's Alpha and Omega.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.740
He is Almighty.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.140
He is the Creator.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.700
Colossians 1, we've studied through the book of Colossians

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.900
this year in our Sunday morning services,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.700
and we found that Colossians 1

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.540
probably in all of Scripture,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.340
if you're gonna go to one passage of Scripture

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.580
to deal with the person of Jesus Christ

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.260
and the exalted Christ, it's here in Colossians 1,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.920
in verse 15 and following,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.500
you find that the Apostle Paul,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.780
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.020
gives us a portrait of Jesus Christ

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.260
that is like no other in all of the Scriptures.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.740
We find in just a few verses of Scripture,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.880
He exalts Him in such an amazing way.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.800
We're thinking this morning at this point

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800
that He is Creator.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.520
Notice in verse number 15,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.760
who is the image of the invisible God,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.240
the firstborn of every creature,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.760
for by Him were all things created

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.840
that are in heaven and that are in earth,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.400
visible and invisible,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.200
whether they be thrones or dominions

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.160
or principalities or powers,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.720
all things were created by Him and for Him.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.440
Aren't you thankful that He's the Creator?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.279
Indeed, when you think about creation,

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:29.840
we understand this morning

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.560
that there's all kinds of debates

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.040
with regard to creation,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.440
and we understand this morning

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.100
that the enemy wants to deny the Creator

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.360
because if they can deny the Creator,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.800
they deny their responsibility to God.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.840
We see that in Romans 1,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.560
but indeed, the Word of God,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.560
it's not just exclusive to Genesis 1-3,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.680
dealing with creation.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.380
We find the record of creation

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.240
all throughout the Scriptures,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.400
and we find that He is the Creator.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.200
He is the Creator.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.279
He is the sustainer.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.319
In Hebrews 1 and verse number 3,

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:08.960
the Bible tells us this great truth

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.479
with regard to not only the creative work of God

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:13.839
that He is the Creator,

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.279
but understanding that He upholds all things,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.119
that He is the sustainer of all things.

00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:20.919
The Bible says this in Hebrews 1

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.080
and verse number 3,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.119
who being the brightness of His glory

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.199
and the express image of His Person

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:28.559
and upholding all things

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:31.199
by the Word of His power,

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:33.839
when He had by Himself purged our sins,

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.639
sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.880
and what great truth is given to us

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.080
in verse number 3,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.760
not only that of creation

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.520
and the sustaining work of God,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.559
but that of redemption as well

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:47.919
is given to us at the end of verse number 3.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.919
But we find that He is the sustainer.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:51.919
Why is it that we have the laws

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:53.639
that we have in nature?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.119
It's because our God sustains all things.

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:58.800
Without Him, you remove Him

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.279
and it falls apart,

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.639
but you find that He upholds all things

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:07.400
by the Word of His power.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.160
Phenomenal.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.080
He's precious.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.360
He's Alpha and Omega.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.199
He's Almighty.

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.720
He's Creator.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.839
He is the sustainer.

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:18.880
Notice He is compassionate.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.600
I love the fact that you find

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.320
throughout the Word of God

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.440
and in Matthew 9,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.680
we'll look there at this portion of Scripture,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.880
but you find the compassion of Christ.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.160
You find that our God is compassionate.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.960
And here in Matthew 9,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.760
the Bible tells us that there was a multitude

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.479
and Jesus saw the multitudes

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:39.919
in verse number 36

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.080
and it tells us that He was moved

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.600
with compassion on them.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.040
Why?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.119
Because they fainted and were scattered abroad

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.919
as sheep having no shepherd.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.360
He was moved with compassion.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.479
We mentioned this morning

00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:56.680
in our Sunday school hours,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.520
we're studying the miracles of Christ

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.080
that we were able to witness

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.119
the compassion of Christ

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.119
and the power of Christ.

00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:07.160
I'm thankful here that as you note here

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.000
that He's moved with compassion,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.360
you find this referenced

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.720
in other portions of Scripture as well

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.040
that He is compassionate.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.519
He is gracious.

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:20.799
Faith sang about God's grace this morning.

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.640
We understand that many of us,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.920
even as we sang at the conclusion of our service

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.080
last Sunday morning,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.119
amazing grace,

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:29.760
that we are very thankful for the grace of God.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.519
In our text of Scripture in 1 Peter 2,

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:34.200
in verse number 3,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.839
we read it just a moment ago,

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.880
and the Bible says this

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.760
with regard to the grace of God,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.040
if so be that ye have tasted

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.239
that the Lord is gracious.

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:47.360
It's part of His nature.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.679
It's who He is.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.600
He's gracious.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.000
And you think about the grace of God.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.920
His saving grace.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.200
His serving grace.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.839
And you find that we sing about His amazing grace.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.880
Paul speaks about His abundant grace.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.000
And you find that as we understand

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.279
the grace of God,

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.799
and we understand this morning

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:11.080
that we have been the recipients of His grace.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.160
For by grace are you saved through faith.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.480
And that not of yourselves,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.839
it is the gift of God,

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:17.679
but not of works,

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.880
lest any man should boast.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.480
Oh, the grace of God.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.480
How precious our God is.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.600
He's merciful.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.239
Grace and mercy are often used together.

00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:31.679
And we find that when you speak

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:34.360
of these two attributes of our God,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.040
that yes, indeed, they are similar,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.600
yet there are contrasts between the two.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.119
God giving us what we do not deserve

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:42.640
in one aspect,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.080
and then God not giving us

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.279
what we do deserve.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.119
Turn over to Ephesians 2.

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:53.679
The reality is that we deserve punishment.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.959
Listen, we are guilty.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:56.880
Amen?

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.720
We're sinners. We're guilty.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.799
The reality is that Paul begins

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.480
this great passage of Scripture

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.480
by speaking about those that were saved,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.119
but he reminds them of their past.

00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:10.000
In Ephesians 2 and verse 1,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.600
"...and you hath He quickened

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.080
who were dead in trespasses and sins."

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:17.119
By the way, we were dead

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:20.600
in our trespasses and sins.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.880
"...you hath He quickened."

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.519
If you've been born again this morning,

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.119
if you've trusted Jesus Christ

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:27.000
as your personal Savior this morning,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.760
you've been made alive.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.279
You were dead spiritually.

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.119
He says this,

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.600
"...wherein in time past

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.360
ye walked according to the course of this world.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.480
According to the Prince of the power of the air,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.720
the Spirit that now worketh

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.559
on the children of disobedience,

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:48.440
among whom also we all had our conversation

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.440
in times past in the lust of our flesh."

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.080
Can we identify with what's being said?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.559
There was a time in your life

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:57.600
that you were not saved.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.880
And that time in your life when you were not saved

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.360
is described here that we all

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.040
were in this same condition in time past.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.320
We're following the lust of our flesh.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.239
"...fulfilling the desires of the flesh

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.320
and of the mind,

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.279
for we're by nature the children of wrath

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:18.559
even as others."

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:20.959
But God.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:22.600
But God.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.760
"...who is rich in mercy

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
for His great love

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.760
wherewith He loved us."

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.320
Aren't you thankful for the mercy of God?

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.559
He's merciful.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:36.600
Who He is.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.320
As we look at these,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.440
just a list of things that I've put together

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.200
to encourage my heart,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.320
to trust that it would be an encouragement

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.519
to your heart as well,

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.080
that we're mindful this morning,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.600
we're thankful for His Person,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.559
for who He is.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:53.880
Yes, that I'm a recipient of His grace,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.959
and yes, that I'm a recipient of His mercy,

00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:57.320
but why am I a recipient?

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.559
Because that's what He is.

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:00.119
That's who He is.

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:02.119
It's part of His very nature.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.679
He's gracious.

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.480
And He's merciful.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.760
We find that He's long-suffering.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.200
Aren't you thankful that our God is long-suffering?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.760
Often times in our lives,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.480
we enjoy the long-suffering of God.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.600
2 Peter 3.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.040
There are times, however,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.000
when others perhaps may be enjoying

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.440
the long-suffering of God

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.040
that we don't seem to understand

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.239
why God isn't dealing with them.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.440
But when God's being long-suffering to us,

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.880
oh, we're so grateful for His long-suffering.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.080
I've often said over the years

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.039
that we ought never mistake

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:44.039
the long-suffering of God for His permission.

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:47.080
God's never okay with sin. Never.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.799
But God is long-suffering to us.

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:52.359
He's patient with us.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:54.320
And you begin to think here,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.200
the Bible within the context of 2 Peter 3

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.559
is speaking of His promise

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:00.880
with regard to His coming,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.479
but it says,

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:03.520
"...the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.440
as some men cannot slacken His notice,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.280
but is long-suffering to us-ward,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.760
not willing that any should perish,

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:12.520
but that all should come to repentance."

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.239
I'm thankful that God is long-suffering.

00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:17.080
We sing a song with the children

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.880
about God created all things.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.200
And He created all things in just six days.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.919
You go through all of the various aspects of creation,

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.359
but then the song deals with,

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:30.599
but He's still working on me.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:32.799
And He is! He's still working on us.

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:35.760
He's long-suffering to us-ward.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.159
He's patient with us.

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:38.840
By the way, aren't you thankful

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.479
that He is long-suffering?

00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:44.000
He's not becoming any of these things.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.200
He is all of these things.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.080
He is precious.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.640
He's long-suffering to us.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.919
I believe, as I mentioned earlier,

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:56.280
as I gave you the definition of precious

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.440
and spoke about the office or rank

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440
that one holds.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.480
I've made this statement that He is King of kings

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.060
and Lord of lords.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.500
The Bible tells us in Psalm 2,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500
if you turn back over there just for a moment

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.680
in how prophetic this particular portion of Scripture is

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.040
even for the day in which we're living.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.840
In Psalm 2,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.040
the Bible speaks here with regard

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.480
to the kings of the earth.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.560
In Psalm 2, in verse 1, it says,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.200
why do the heathen rage

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.440
and the people imagine a vain thing?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.880
The kings of the earth set themselves

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.600
and the rulers take counsel together

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.120
against who?

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.760
Against the Lord!

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.520
And against His anointed saying,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.800
let us break their bands asunder

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.560
and cast away their cords from us.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.280
Listen, we're living in a time

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.600
where there's so much prophetic nature

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.120
of this particular portion of Scripture.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.680
The kings of the earth set themselves,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.120
the rulers take counsel together

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.720
against the Lord and against His anointed,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.560
but He, verse 4,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.560
that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.480
The Lord shall have them in derision.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.520
Why does He laugh?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.440
Because He's King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.360
No one's ever going to conquer Him.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.639
No one's going to defeat Him.

00:21:24.639 --> 00:21:26.720
No one's going to alter His plan.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.400
His plan will be fulfilled

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.120
exactly as He has told us it will be fulfilled.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.080
He is King of kings, Lord of lords,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.720
the only potentate.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.040
We find that there are men,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.639
there are people upon this earth

00:21:38.639 --> 00:21:41.080
that have titles and have positions

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.000
and we find that the Bible says in Proverbs

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.080
that the heart of the king is where?

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.520
It's in the hand of the Lord.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.420
And He turns it however He desires

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.800
because He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.600
All the kings of the earth,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.959
they can set themselves against the Lord

00:21:57.959 --> 00:21:59.639
and they can come up with their plans

00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:02.080
and they can devise all that they want to devise,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.020
but He is not in their hand.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.860
Amen?

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.319
Listen, we ought to be thankful for that this morning.

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:10.440
We ought to be thankful that He is King of kings

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.800
and Lord of lords,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.400
that He is the great I Am.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.199
Let me say this, He is victorious.

00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:20.600
He never loses.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.199
Never.

00:22:23.199 --> 00:22:25.279
He is victorious.

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:27.760
Satan thought he defeated Him, did he not?

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:32.000
Pilate and all the Romans, the Jews,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.320
gave all the instruction with making that grave

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.520
as sure, as secure as they could.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.440
Didn't matter what they did at that grave.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.760
As we sing on Easter morn,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.960
up from the grave He arose.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.800
Amen?

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.680
He is victorious.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.520
Notice back in the Old Testament, if you will,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.360
1 Chronicles 29,

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.440
I love the way that this particular portion of Scripture

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.559
is the wording here.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:00.559
And what a joy when you think about the greatness

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:01.820
and the power of our God.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.360
And in 1 Chronicles 29, in verse number 11,

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.760
just a powerful verse of Scripture,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.600
perhaps a verse that you'd like to commit to memory

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.040
and to be encouraged by the truth contained therein.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.600
The Bible says in 1 Chronicles 29, in verse number 11,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.919
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:27.040
and the glory and the victory and the majesty

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.919
for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine.

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.320
Thine is the kingdom, O Lord,

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.320
and Thou art exalted as head above all.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.040
Isn't that a powerful verse of Scripture?

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:46.119
I mean, you ought to memorize that verse of Scripture.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.160
Seriously.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.320
You see what, as David is worshiping,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.880
as David is giving the offering

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.400
and as they're worshiping here,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.760
he gives us under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.760
this great truth with regard to who our God is.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.360
Isaiah 25.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.559
Notice here in this portion of Scripture

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.800
when we think about the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.880
and we think about Him conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.720
Isaiah 25 is prophetic, no doubt.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.920
As we look at the truth of Isaiah 25 in verse number 8

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.360
and we find that Paul will use this portion of Scripture

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.440
at the end of 1 Corinthians 15,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.200
but here in Isaiah 25 in verse number 8,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.279
the Bible says He will swallow up death in what?

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.399
In victory.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.160
The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.519
and the rebuke of His people

00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:46.959
shall He take away from off all the earth

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:49.640
for the Lord hath spoken it.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.279
Aren't those good words at the end of verse number 8?

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:55.399
For the Lord hath spoken it.

00:24:55.399 --> 00:24:58.080
What He says, He does.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080
Always.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.640
And here we find that the first aspect

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.160
of this verse of Scripture when it says

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.080
He will swallow up death in victory.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.200
Again, we see that Paul references this

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.920
in 1 Corinthians 15 in verse 54, 55, 56,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.959
and then you come to verse 57,

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:19.880
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.119
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:24.360
And what's the chapter of 1 Corinthians 15,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.239
what's it all about?

00:25:25.239 --> 00:25:26.959
It's about the resurrection.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.440
If there's one place in all of God's word

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.519
that you wanna run to in understanding the resurrection

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:36.040
and the blessedness of the truth

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.040
that then impacts us as the hope of the resurrection

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.480
is 1 Corinthians 15.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.480
It's the chapter that deals with the resurrection

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.040
like no other chapter.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.799
And we find that He is victorious.

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.519
Listen, He swallowed up death in victory.

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:55.720
We can read in Hebrews chapter number two.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.480
We can read in 1 John how that He destroyed the enemy,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.799
the devil who had the power of death,

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:02.720
how that He destroyed him.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.640
How did He do that?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.959
On the cross.

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:08.519
In the very place where the enemy thought He had Him.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.040
But He proved to be victorious.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.920
Our God is victorious.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920
He always is.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.239
He always wins.

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:19.640
He never fails.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.679
He is victorious.

00:26:22.679 --> 00:26:25.720
The Curtis Hudson used to sing all the time

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.160
at the end of messages, I mean regularly,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.720
he would sing, I'm on the winning side.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.880
And he'd sing that wonderful song

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.920
and he'd talk about being on the winning side.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.640
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.600
that I'm on the winning side.

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.920
I've read the book of Revelation, amen?

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.239
And guess what?

00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:44.440
We're victors.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.399
We're conquerors.

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:48.160
We're more than conquerors through Christ.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.640
He is victorious and because He is victorious

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.559
and because I am His, I too can be victorious.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.160
The book of Joshua is not a picture of going to heaven.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.160
Some have purported that over the years.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.600
But the book of Joshua is a picture

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.440
of the victorious Christian life.

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:14.360
There's death in the book of Joshua.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.600
There's war in the book of Joshua.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.160
There's not gonna be war or death in heaven, amen?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.640
So it's not a picture of heaven.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
It's a picture, however, of the victorious Christian life.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.399
And oh, how we can have victory

00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:29.119
because He is victorious.

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:30.600
He is faithful.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600
He is faithful.

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:34.760
Faithful is He that calleth you who also will do it

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.959
is what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 24.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.440
But I wanna draw your attention

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.760
to what the Bible says in Revelation 19.

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:46.399
In Revelation 19, this portion of scripture

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:50.200
gives us a glimpse as to the second coming of Christ

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.160
at the end of the tribulation period,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.440
not when He just comes in the air at the rapture

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.959
to take the church with Him,

00:27:55.959 --> 00:27:57.839
but at the end of the tribulation period

00:27:57.839 --> 00:27:59.760
when He comes all the way back to the earth

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.720
and He's going to establish His millennial kingdom.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.679
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 11,

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.519
and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:14.519
and He that sat upon Him was called Faithful and True.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:18.959
And in righteousness He doth judge and make war.

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:20.839
His eyes was a flame of fire

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.559
and on His head were many crowns

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:25.959
and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself.

00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:29.040
He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.440
and His name is called the Word of God.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.799
The armies which were in heaven

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.239
followed Him upon white horses,

00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:37.159
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:38.760
You know what?

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760
I'm gonna be there.

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:43.039
I'm gonna be on one of those horses.

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:43.880
Amen?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.760
And if you've been saved, you are too.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.359
I told Holly just a little while ago,

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.840
I can't remember, just a couple of weeks ago,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.080
I said, you know, horseback riding is one of those things

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.359
that I'm thankful I checked it off of my list,

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:56.039
but really I have no interest in ever doing it again.

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:58.619
Some of you like horseback riding and I'm not against it,

00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:00.720
it's just not what I was comfortable with.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:03.960
But I did it, it's off my list.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.880
I've done it one time

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.679
and I'm happy to have been able to do it.

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.859
But there's coming a day that I'm gonna ride a horse.

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:12.720
I'm glad I'm not gonna be in this body.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.559
Amen?

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:15.159
But I'm gonna ride a horse.

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:16.599
It's gonna be exciting.

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:18.960
The Bible says that the armies which were in heaven

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.000
followed Him upon white horses,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.320
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.679
Out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.679
that with it He should smite the nations

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:29.720
and He shall rule them with a rod of iron

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.760
and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.720
and wrath of Almighty God

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.720
and He hath on His vesture and on His thigh

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.440
a name written King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.359
In verse number 11 it says that His name

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:47.840
was called Faithful and True.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.900
I'm thankful that my God is faithful.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.919
He's faithful.

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:54.419
He's trustworthy.

00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:55.520
He's dependable.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.119
We've mentioned that He's victorious, He never fails.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.919
We sing this morning about Him.

00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:05.019
Now, great is thy faithfulness.

00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:06.639
And oh, how we ought to be thankful

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:09.319
that our God is faithful.

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:11.919
He is wonderful.

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:14.759
Joy Clemens sang a song

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:17.579
when she was here a number of years ago.

00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.179
The song, I think it was titled,

00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:22.599
He is More Than Wonderful.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:26.599
I mean, when all that we can imagine,

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:29.059
all that we can wrap our minds around

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:31.399
by studying this book

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:33.139
and conclude that He's wonderful,

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:36.339
the reality is that He's more than wonderful.

00:30:36.339 --> 00:30:38.079
I stood in that foyer years ago

00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:39.379
and I said to an individual,

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.499
they were struggling and asking questions,

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:44.219
and I said, listen, let me ask you this morning,

00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:46.759
in your mind, in your heart,

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:48.539
in your mind this morning,

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:50.379
how great is God?

00:30:50.379 --> 00:30:52.959
And they gave me an answer.

00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:56.619
And I said, with all due respect, He's greater.

00:30:56.619 --> 00:30:57.539
Why?

00:30:57.539 --> 00:31:01.339
Because our mind cannot fully comprehend Him.

00:31:01.339 --> 00:31:04.399
He transcends us.

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:08.159
My finite mind cannot comprehend

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:11.279
an infinite God.

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:14.259
But I can agree with 1 Peter 2

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:16.359
in verse 7,

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:18.179
when the Bible says,

00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:20.759
unto you therefore which believe,

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:22.179
He is precious.

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:24.259
I say, I agree with that.

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:25.319
I've believed on Him.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:27.059
I've put my faith and trust in Him.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:30.159
And He is precious.

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.859
This morning, we're going to be thankful

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:34.199
for His Person, for who He is.

00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:35.519
This morning, we're going to be thankful

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.739
for His presence.

00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:39.559
Not only for His Person, for who He is,

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.259
but for His presence.

00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:43.139
I'm so thankful.

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:46.619
The Bible tells us that He is with us.

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:48.459
What joy and comfort,

00:31:48.459 --> 00:31:51.219
what peace floods my soul

00:31:51.219 --> 00:31:52.479
when I consider this morning

00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:55.799
the presence of God Almighty.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:59.419
Notice, if you will, back in Psalm 23.

00:31:59.419 --> 00:32:03.679
We're just going to look at a few more verses.

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:08.599
Psalm 23, it's a very familiar psalm.

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:15.139
One in which we have heard many times.

00:32:15.139 --> 00:32:17.419
We want to be mindful of the presence of God,

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:19.059
the presence of My Shepherd

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:20.839
as it's mentioned in verse 4.

00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:23.439
Yea, though I walk through the valley

00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:26.319
of the shadow of death,

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:27.739
I will fear no evil.

00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:29.239
Why?

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:31.299
For Thou art with Me.

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:34.599
Thy rod, Thy staff,

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:38.039
they comfort Me.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:41.839
The presence of the Shepherd

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:44.319
says to the sheep,

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:46.159
I will fear no evil,

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:48.119
because you're with Me.

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:49.759
You're with Me.

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:53.499
Notice in Psalm 139.

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:55.619
And really, you could look at a number of verses

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:56.819
throughout Psalm 139

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:01.359
dealing with the presence of God.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:03.659
But I'm just going to look at one verse of Scripture

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:06.119
and it's really a question,

00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:08.259
but it's an obvious answer to the question.

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:10.199
If you read the following verses,

00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:12.219
you'll understand it.

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:15.379
But in Psalm 139 in verse 7,

00:33:15.379 --> 00:33:15.919
it says,

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:18.599
Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:24.199
For whither shall I flee from Thy presence?

00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:27.819
Hebrews 13 and verse 5

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.259
tells us that we're to be content

00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:30.439
with such things we have.

00:33:30.439 --> 00:33:31.599
And then it tells us this,

00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:32.759
for He hath saith,

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:35.239
I will never leave Thee,

00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:37.279
nor forsake Thee.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:39.919
I will never leave Thee, nor forsake Thee.

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:43.359
What a precious truth of the Word of God.

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:45.639
And this morning when I think about His presence,

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:47.479
I'm mindful of His person

00:33:47.479 --> 00:33:48.679
and I rejoice greatly

00:33:48.679 --> 00:33:50.919
and I'm thankful for who He is.

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:53.199
But then when I think about His presence,

00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:55.059
I'm going to take you on a journey

00:33:55.059 --> 00:33:56.959
through the Scriptures here just for a moment.

00:33:56.959 --> 00:33:58.559
We're not going to turn to any passages.

00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.679
We've turned to enough.

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.039
Our time is short.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.359
But I want you to just think about

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:07.039
these biblical accounts for just a moment.

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.599
And I want you to consider with me

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:10.679
the presence of God.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.279
And I want to challenge you this morning

00:34:13.279 --> 00:34:15.119
with the list that I've provided,

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.919
I want to challenge you to

00:34:16.919 --> 00:34:19.119
go find some other references.

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:21.399
Go find some other truths

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:22.599
within the Word of God

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:26.439
where we consider the presence of God.

00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:31.159
It was God who was in the ark with Noah.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.279
In fact, when you read,

00:34:34.279 --> 00:34:35.919
the Bible says that God says,

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:39.439
come into the ark.

00:34:39.439 --> 00:34:43.159
Come into the ark.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.839
That's significant.

00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:48.519
It doesn't even say go into the ark.

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:49.799
Amen?

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:52.679
Come into the ark.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.199
Because He's there.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.399
Because God is there.

00:34:57.399 --> 00:34:59.559
Noah and his wife and his three sons

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:03.399
and their wives and all the animals.

00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:05.279
But God was there.

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:07.919
God was in that ark with Noah.

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:11.439
God was in the pit with Joseph

00:35:11.439 --> 00:35:13.559
when his brothers wanted to kill Him.

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:14.759
And then Reuben says,

00:35:14.799 --> 00:35:15.959
let's just throw Him in the pit.

00:35:15.959 --> 00:35:16.879
And He throws Him in the pit

00:35:16.879 --> 00:35:17.639
and they're trying to figure out

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:18.639
what they're going to do.

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:22.719
It was God who was in the pit with Joseph.

00:35:22.719 --> 00:35:25.599
It was God that was in the prison with Joseph

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.759
after He's brought up out of that pit

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.439
and after He's sold into slavery

00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:31.359
and we find that He's purchased

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:33.839
and He's there and He's in Potiphar's home

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:36.239
and we find that there are false accusations

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:37.319
that are made against Him

00:35:37.319 --> 00:35:39.639
and with those false accusations,

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:44.279
the sentence is given to prison you go.

00:35:44.319 --> 00:35:48.999
It was God that was with Joseph in the prison.

00:35:48.999 --> 00:35:51.599
As awful as the pit and the prison are,

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.919
I would submit to you this morning

00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:56.879
that it was God who was with Joseph in the palace.

00:35:56.879 --> 00:35:59.959
Because just as God is with us in the hard times,

00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:02.599
He's with us in the good times.

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:05.639
And just as Joseph went from the pit to the prison,

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:06.999
He also went to the palace,

00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:10.239
but it was God that was with Him in the palace.

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:12.439
You see the character and the behavior,

00:36:12.439 --> 00:36:16.119
the nature of Joseph and you understand

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:20.319
that Joseph was a man that lived in the presence of God.

00:36:20.319 --> 00:36:22.079
Joseph was a man that understood

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.639
though he was in Egypt,

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:26.839
he lived in the very presence of God Almighty.

00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:30.199
It was God who was in the wilderness with Moses.

00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:31.599
It was God who was there

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:33.239
that was providing the leadership.

00:36:33.239 --> 00:36:37.319
Remember that as Moses would be the human individual,

00:36:37.319 --> 00:36:39.879
the person that would be responsible

00:36:39.879 --> 00:36:41.479
for leading the children of Israel

00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:42.559
through the wilderness,

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:44.559
it was God who was leading them.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:46.919
It was that pillar of cloud by day

00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:49.119
and it was the pillar of fire by night.

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:51.439
It was God who led them.

00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:53.599
Though they would complain and they would murmur

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:54.439
and they would say,

00:36:54.439 --> 00:36:56.039
Moses, why did you bring us here?

00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:58.799
The reality is that he was following God.

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:01.959
It was God that was with him in the wilderness.

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:02.799
We sing the song,

00:37:02.799 --> 00:37:06.399
my Lord knows the way through the wilderness.

00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:09.439
All you have to do is follow.

00:37:10.399 --> 00:37:13.759
It was God who was with Moses there in the wilderness.

00:37:13.759 --> 00:37:17.439
It was God who was in the land of promise with Joshua.

00:37:17.439 --> 00:37:18.959
You remember at the beginning

00:37:18.959 --> 00:37:21.039
of all that was taking place

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:23.359
as Joshua has got the responsibility

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:25.039
and God is encouraging him

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:26.519
and God is telling him

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:28.199
that he's going to give him the land

00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:29.679
and that he's going to be with him

00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:31.359
and all that takes place

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:34.439
and you come to the latter part of the fifth chapter

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:36.239
and you find that Joshua comes

00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:38.279
and he's over there by Jericho

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:40.279
and he's looking and it says that he comes

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:41.559
and he says to this one,

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:44.399
art thou for us or for our adversaries?

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:50.599
The captain of the Lord's army was the Lord.

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:51.439
He says,

00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:54.199
nay, but as captain of the host of the Lord

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:55.119
am I now come

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:58.039
and Joshua fell on his face to the earth.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:00.239
It was God who was with Joshua

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.399
in that land of promise.

00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:05.639
It was God who was with David in the wilderness

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:07.079
when he's fleeing,

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:10.799
he's running and Saul has made him his continual enemy

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:12.839
and Saul is seeking David

00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:14.879
through all the thousands of Israel.

00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:16.959
It was God who was with him.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:22.159
It was God who was with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:23.679
in that fiery furnace.

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.719
We're mindful of Daniel three

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:30.039
and we read and we rejoice in what took place

00:38:30.039 --> 00:38:32.079
and we find that Nebuchadnezzar says,

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:34.440
hey, how many did we put in that fire?

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.479
Three that were bound.

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:40.880
But there are four that are walking around

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.279
and the fourth is like the Son of God.

00:38:44.279 --> 00:38:46.880
It was God who was in that fiery furnace

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.279
with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

00:38:49.279 --> 00:38:51.479
It was God and just a few chapters later

00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:54.519
that was with Daniel in that den of lions.

00:38:55.799 --> 00:38:58.039
It was God who was with Jeremiah

00:38:58.039 --> 00:38:59.760
when he was in the dungeon,

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.479
when he was in the pit.

00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:03.760
It was God who was with Jeremiah.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.000
It was God who was with Peter

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.719
when he was in prison, fast asleep.

00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:10.519
The church is praying.

00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:12.200
It was God who was with them.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.959
It was God who was with Paul and Silas

00:39:14.959 --> 00:39:18.359
when they were in prison there in Philippi.

00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:21.059
Listen this morning, God is with you.

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:23.359
God is with you.

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:26.399
He's promised His presence.

00:39:26.399 --> 00:39:29.079
And this morning, we could go on and on

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:31.159
with illustration after illustration,

00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:34.519
account after account of the very presence of God

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:38.359
and how God has promised His presence to His people

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:40.479
this morning.

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:43.200
As we think about this Thanksgiving week,

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.559
we say He is precious, He is.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.479
He is precious.

00:39:50.479 --> 00:39:53.519
I'm thankful this morning for His person, for who He is.

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.039
I won't repeat all of those things

00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:59.599
but I'm so thankful for who He is.

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.959
By the way, you can add to that list as well.

00:40:01.959 --> 00:40:07.999
well. These lists are not exhaustive. We'd be here a lot longer, and then we'd still

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:15.319
miss some things, right? For his person, I'm thankful this morning for his presence. He'll

00:40:15.319 --> 00:40:24.439
never leave me nor forsake me. Paul said this, everyone left me, but the Lord stood with

00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:33.239
me. Man, the presence of God. You think about all of those accounts that we briefly referenced.

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:40.519
God was with them. And this morning, God is with you. Think about all the things that

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:45.239
we deal with in life, and you think of all the trials and tribulations. Oh, if we could

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:50.199
just change our attention for just a little while, more than just the week of Thanksgiving,

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:58.639
by the way, but just let's change our attention to He is precious. Just get filled up and

00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:08.199
overwhelmed with the person, who He is. Begin to rejoice in His presence. This evening,

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:14.839
we're going to look at His promises. I hope that you'd come back. Again, could not be

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:20.079
an exhaustive list, but I'm going to give you 15 promises this evening that are to

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:29.679
cause us to rejoice greatly. I agree. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. I've believed,

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:39.139
and I agree. He is precious. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank

00:41:39.139 --> 00:41:48.819
you for this book, the Bible. I thank you for how you have given us a portrait of who

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:55.139
you are. I know, as I've already admitted publicly this morning, that we could never

00:41:55.139 --> 00:42:06.619
fully comprehend who you are. I agree with the psalmist when he says, I know the Lord

00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:16.039
is great. Then later on, no contradiction, however, he says the greatness of God is unsearchable.

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:23.339
I know you're great, but we just simply scratch the surface of your greatness. I pray this

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:30.059
morning that you'd help us to just get our attention focused upon thee. Help us to be

00:42:30.059 --> 00:42:36.819
thankful for your person, for who you are. Help us to be thankful for your presence.

00:42:36.819 --> 00:42:43.339
There's one that's not sure of heaven. God, it's our prayer that today they'd be saved.

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:52.979
They don't know who Jesus is. They've not believed, and therefore they've not concluded

00:42:53.019 --> 00:43:02.019
that he's precious. Today is the day of salvation. There'd be one that's in that condition. Oh,

00:43:02.019 --> 00:43:05.899
God, would you move and work, draw them to yourself as only you can. Pray that the Holy

00:43:05.899 --> 00:43:12.899
Spirit of God would convict of sin and judgment of Christ's righteousness. I pray, Father,

00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:21.379
that you'd be with each of your people here this morning. Would you help us to just get

00:43:21.379 --> 00:43:29.619
our eyes upon you and say, as the psalmist said in Psalm 33, I stand in awe of you.

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:32.659
Move and work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with

00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:38.219
me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. It's our custom to have an invitation at the end

00:43:38.219 --> 00:43:42.659
of our services to give you an opportunity to respond. Perhaps you want to come to this

00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:47.379
old-fashioned altar and just thank God for who he is, for the book that he gave us that

00:43:47.379 --> 00:43:53.379
provides to us these great truths. Maybe this morning you're not sure of heaven, and

00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:56.919
we could take a Bible and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:43:56.919 --> 00:43:58.939
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
