WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
5 through 11 this morning as we continue with our study

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.920
through the book of 2 Corinthians.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.300
Our theme of course, God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.159
Our theme for 2025 and looking here at preaching

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.640
through the book of 2 Corinthians.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.440
It'll be in chapter two this morning.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.639
The subject of forgiveness is addressed

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.239
throughout the Bible.

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.840
First we discover the glorious truth

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.760
and it is a glorious truth that our God

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.639
is a God who is ready to forgive.

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.280
Our God is a God who is ready to pardon.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.040
Our God, the Bible says that with him there is forgiveness.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.720
And the reality is that that is a wonderful,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.400
glorious truth of the Bible.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.979
And this morning when we understand that God

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.200
has revealed that truth to us as his creation

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.000
because he wants us to know that he is a God who forgives.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Now we understand the balance and the character

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.759
and nature of God that he forgives but he also judges.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:02.360
And we understand that forgiveness is made available

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.199
but if you reject God's forgiveness

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.599
then you stand in judgment.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.040
And that is the truth.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.760
See God judged Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.239
when he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:21.760
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.040
and the wrath of God will not be poured upon me

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.400
for Jesus took my place and if you're saved here

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
this morning he took your place and I'm so glad

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.599
that I can stand here this morning as a recipient

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.040
of God's forgiveness and I can stand with assurance

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.160
and with confidence and say I have been forgiven.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.220
No, I wasn't forgiven because I deserve forgiveness

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.160
and you're not forgiven because you deserve forgiveness

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.839
but we have been forgiven this morning

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:55.559
because our God is a God who is ready to forgive

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:57.199
and ready to pardon.

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:58.919
I'm reminded of the wonderful truth

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:01.080
and we think about forgiveness in the context

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.559
of a believer in coming to Christ

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:07.000
and accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal savior

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.119
and being forgiven of our sin and being given

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.639
the gift of eternal life but you know as believers

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.279
the reality is that at the moment of salvation

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.460
our sin nature is not eradicated.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.240
The old man is not just kind of no longer,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.940
no, the Bible says that we're to put on the new,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.539
we're to put off the old and we understand this put off

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.020
and put on principle that God teaches us in his word

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.899
and the reality is that as believers you sin.

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.059
You say oh not me, well you better get in the Bible amen

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.380
because if you say not me then the Bible says this of you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.660
that you're a liar and you've made God a liar

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.380
and his truth is not in you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.179
and that's a pretty serious indictment.

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.179
1 John's pretty clear that if we say that we have no sin

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.820
that we've deceived ourselves and his truth is not in us

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.179
and we make God a liar.

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.759
So the reality is that even as saved people we sin

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.580
but here's the wonderful truth.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.339
The Bible says if we confess our sin

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.580
he is faithful and just to what?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.259
To forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.279
The Bible goes on in 1 John chapter number two

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.320
to tell us that we have an advocate with the father,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.199
Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.199
Literally he is in that capacity of being our advocate.

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.559
He is our defense attorney

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.179
and never does he argue for your innocence, why?

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.720
Because we're guilty, he simply says I paid for it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.479
and that's a wonderful truth of God's word.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.080
This morning we think about the subject of forgiveness

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.679
and we're reminded immediately as we think about

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.479
the subject that first we discover

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.199
that our God is a God of forgiveness.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.479
Then as we study the scriptures we discover

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.660
that as God's people, as the recipients of God's forgiveness

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.039
that we too have been instructed to forgive.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.940
We've been given the instruction to forgive.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.399
We'll look at some passages this morning in Matthew

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.399
and in Luke but let me just read for you

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.399
one verse of scripture before we dive in here

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.160
to 2 Corinthians two and it's a familiar verse,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.240
Ephesians four and verse number 32

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.399
where the Bible says this and be kind one to another,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.679
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:24.679
notice even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:29.200
God has given to us as the people

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.679
that have been the recipients of his grace and his mercy

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:34.399
that we have been forgiven,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.920
that we are to be a people that forgive.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.959
And this is so important as we come to this passage

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:43.480
in 2 Corinthians chapter number two,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.480
the title of the message is simply that, forgiveness.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.399
And we come to 2 Corinthians chapter number two

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.640
in verses five through 11, notice what the Bible says.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.760
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.600
but in part that I may not overcharge you all.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.380
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.279
which was inflicted of many.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.440
So that contrary wise he ought rather to forgive him

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.839
and comfort him lest perhaps such in one

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.799
should be swallowed up with over much sorrow.

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:16.200
Wherefore, I beseech you

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.320
that you would confirm your love toward him.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.079
For to this end also did I write

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.480
that I might know the proof of you

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.600
whether you be obedient in all things.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.559
To whom you forgive anything, I forgive also.

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.959
For if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:36.040
for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.160
And then notice this verse,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.440
lest Satan should get an advantage of us

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.160
for we are not ignorant of his devices.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.440
Obviously, as we begin our study of 2 Corinthians,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.839
we understand there's much history

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.720
between the Apostle Paul and the church at Corinth.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.000
It was God that used the Apostle Paul to go to Corinth

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.640
to see a church established

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.239
and God used Paul in a great way.

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:01.440
Paul writes to the church in Corinth

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.959
and we have the letter of 1 Corinthians

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.640
and we find that in that letter,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.559
the Apostle Paul deals with many things

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.519
that are taking place within the church.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.399
We find that he begins to deal with the divisions

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.920
and the carnality and all that's present

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.320
in the church at Corinth.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.359
He then begins to address problems

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:19.480
in the church in Corinth

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.480
and we'll reference one said problem

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.200
that's in 1 Corinthians 5 this morning

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.720
in this text of scripture in 2 Corinthians 2.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.839
And then Paul goes on as you continue to read

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.399
through the book of 1 Corinthians

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:34.040
and he kind of makes this transition

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:36.640
and you can read it this way in chapter number seven

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.480
in verse number one.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.519
He says, now concerning the things

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.480
whereof you wrote unto me.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.959
And so the Apostle Paul gives them truth.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.399
Of course, it's all under the inspiration

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:46.760
of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.160
but he's dealing with what's going on at Corinth.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.959
He's addressing the matters,

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.279
but then evidently the church in Corinth,

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.440
some part of the church at Corinth

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.760
had sent Paul a letter

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.640
and had inquired about certain things.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.359
So beginning in chapter number seven,

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:06.200
Paul begins to give answers to the questions

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.359
that were asked of him by the church in Corinth

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:11.239
in order to provide them with counsel,

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:13.320
with direction, with truth.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.200
And because this was a church that was carnal.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.000
This was a church that was divided.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.600
This was a church that had all kinds of problems

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.440
and we find that God is instructing them.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.119
As we mentioned a couple of weeks ago,

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:28.679
and really if we take the whole

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:31.420
of what we've studied thus far in 2 Corinthians,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.540
we had an introductory message from the 12th chapter

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.459
that God's grace is sufficient,

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.220
but then we got right into the fact

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.260
that where there are sorrows, there is God's comfort.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.179
And what a blessing to know that though we deal

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:49.019
with hardships and difficulties in life,

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:51.859
that our God is the God of all comfort

00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:55.420
and that he comes and he brings to us exactly what we need

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.140
and he comforts us, yes, through his spirit

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.679
and yes, through his word,

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.480
but we also understand that he'll provide comfort to us

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.040
through one another as believers,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.559
as brothers and sisters in Christ

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:09.839
and what a blessing that is.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:13.000
A couple of weeks ago, we attempted to look at the passage

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.440
and deal with the subject of when you are misunderstood

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.559
because Paul was misunderstood by these believers in Corinth.

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:23.079
See, Paul didn't come like he said he was gonna come

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:25.480
and there was good reason for him not coming,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.959
but because he did not come, Paul was judged.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.079
Paul was criticized.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.619
Paul was spoken evil of.

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:34.200
Paul was kind of painted in this view.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.580
He says one thing, but he does something else.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.719
He says yes, but he really means no.

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.679
He says no, but he really means yes

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.119
and it was a real mess.

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:45.539
And so Paul begins to provide for us

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:47.919
a beautiful passage of scripture

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:51.359
that helps us to understand when you are misunderstood

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:54.440
and when I am misunderstood, how do we approach that?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.080
How do we deal with that?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.000
And I said this, we must first examine ourselves.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.479
Before we ever try to begin to explain ourselves,

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:05.599
we better examine ourselves

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.739
and Paul was able to stand before the Lord

00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:10.320
with a pure conscience and be able to say,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.479
I've examined myself and I've not done anything wrong here

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.320
and then provide explanation.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.599
We now come into this text of scripture

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:21.080
and Paul once again is going to begin

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.280
addressing a matter that had been previously addressed

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.679
in the first book.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.840
I gave you all of that background information

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.739
so that it all makes sense this morning

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:34.000
when we take these few verses of scripture

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.739
and study them, we want to make sure

00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:40.380
that we're getting the truth within the greater context

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.239
of what's going on at Corinth.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.119
So begin to look at this passage

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:46.479
and I want you, if you're taking notes,

00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:50.239
to note number one, the conflict in Corinth.

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:52.239
And by the way, Corinth was a place

00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:54.159
where conflict was regular

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.679
and this was nothing new for there to be conflict

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.039
in Corinth, but we find specifically

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.440
with regard to what we're.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.040
looking at here in verses 5 and 6 of our text of Scripture, that there was some conflict

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.600
in Corinth over this matter that had been previously addressed. Notice Paul says in

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.160
verse number 5, but if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part. In other

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.240
words, Paul says, yes, there was some level of offense to me, but it was to the whole

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.440
body, to the whole church. And what Paul's dealing with, and he's referring back to that

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.560
matter in 1 Corinthians chapter number 5, this wickedness, this sin was going to have

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.000
an effect on the whole body, not just on Paul as an individual, but on the whole body. He

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.080
says that I may not overcharge you all. Sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:52.760
inflicted of many. So Paul begins to address not only the sin or the offense, but he deals

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.920
with the punishment, and this is where the conflict in Corinth enters in. And by the

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.920
way, if you live any number of days on earth, you find that conflict at times cannot be

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.560
avoided. In fact, Paul says it this way to the church, to the believers in Rome, as much

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.120
as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Have you ever been in a situation where you

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.480
said, man, everything within me I've tried to live at peace, and I just don't know what's

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.120
going on here? There's conflict. And so how do we deal with it? Well, there's conflict

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:31.240
here, and Paul addressed back again in 1 Corinthians chapter 5, the wicked behavior of that man.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.240
And that man was in gross, immoral sin, and we find that Paul addresses it. In fact, Paul

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.880
says it this way, I'm not there, and I've judged already. And that's all those people

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.200
who say judge not, go read that and just kind of consider that for a few moments.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.200
Because the reality is that Paul says, I've already judged. And he lays out what the punishment

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.639
should be for this offender. By the way, the Lord Jesus Christ is the one in the Gospel

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:08.400
of Matthew that provided for the disciples that would be the early church leaders the

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:15.520
pattern for church discipline. And so God is, listen, the reality is that as individual

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.720
believers, we understand that whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. Right? God is not,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:30.639
he forgives, but he doesn't turn a blind eye to your sin. Amen? He forgives if we confess

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:37.160
our sin. Listen, this morning we must understand that here as Paul is dealing with this, yes,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.040
as individual believers, we deal with the chastening of God, but as a church, there's

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:50.800
a responsibility for church discipline if needed. And it was needed in Corinth. It was

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.440
needed in Corinth. And so Paul says, as he writes in 1 Corinthians chapter 5, he addressed

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.600
the wicked behavior, but then he provides the church with counsel in addressing the

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.600
matter. It appears that as we read 2 Corinthians chapter number 2, that the church at Corinth

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.960
had accepted and followed the counsel. The Bible says in verse number 6, sufficient to

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.199
such a man as the punishment, this punishment, which was inflicted of many. And so Paul,

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:22.960
as we begin reading here, it appears that they had gone through and they gave the punishment

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.240
as it had been prescribed. It appears as you read through the passage of Scripture, and

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.440
we understand the purpose as we compare Scripture with Scripture, that discipline is always

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:44.119
for the purpose of restoration. Discipline is not, the purpose of discipline in the church

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:53.240
is not excommunication. It is restoration. You remember the wonderful 23rd Psalm? He

00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:02.240
restoreth my soul. What is Galatians 6? He that are spiritual, restore such in one. Is

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.400
that not what the Bible says? And the purpose of church discipline this morning, as we

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.479
look here in the church in Corinth, is not excommunication, but restoration. And so as

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:18.200
we read this, and we understand the goal or the purpose of church discipline, it seems

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.480
as if this offender, this one that was guilty, according to 1 Corinthians chapter 5, that

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:33.519
was involved in this gross immoral sin, it appears that he repented. He repented. Although

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:40.519
he had repented, he had not yet been restored. And therein lies the conflict in Corinth.

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:46.080
See, it's as if, as you look here and begin to see what Paul is saying in verses 5 and

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.399
6, and even as we dig further into the text this morning, that there were some perhaps

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:54.799
within the church in Corinth that thought that there should be more severe punishment

00:14:54.799 --> 00:15:00.959
that would be laid upon this offender, that there would be no opportunity for restoration,

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:07.799
etc., etc. And Paul is going to address this conflict. Listen, this is sufficient what

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:15.839
has happened. And see, here this morning, the reality is our God is interested in restoration.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:20.320
Our God is interested in restoration. Let me be careful to say this this morning. It

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:28.399
is absolutely the truth that an offended, or an offender, can be restored, but may not

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:35.360
be restored to the same position. Because the position may have qualifications that

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.160
they no longer qualify for. Does that make sense to you this morning? The Bible lays

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.880
out very plainly qualifications for pastors and for deacons. Beyond that, our God gives

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.440
us not only truth in His Word, but He gives us the Holy Spirit to give us discernment

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.920
and understanding, and He gives us good sense. And the reality is that there are some times

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.440
that someone could offend in a particular area that they may not be able to work with

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:08.200
a certain group of people any longer. Does that make sense? They can be restored, but

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:15.040
they may not be able to have that same place of service. But the reality is that they must

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.959
be restored if they are repented. If they have repented, the goal of church discipline

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:27.839
is restoration, not excommunication. So there's this conflict that's here within the church,

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:32.959
and this conflict had to be addressed. Why? Because once again, the conflict within the

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:38.519
church is keeping the church from doing the will of God. The conflict within the church

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:44.420
has the church focused on something other than what they need to be focused on. They're

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.720
not concerned about the discipleship and the growth of the believers in the church. They're

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.839
not concerned about reaching their community with the gospel. No, why? Because there's

00:16:53.839 --> 00:17:01.279
conflict within. And so the conflict in Corinth must be addressed. Number two in our notes

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:06.880
this morning, as we look at verses 7 through 10, we see Paul's counsel, Paul's counsel.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.160
I'm thankful this morning that the Apostle Paul provided the church in Corinth with a

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:19.440
straightforward plan. I'm thankful this morning that God's Word is counsel for us, that we

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:27.959
go to the Bible to understand how we're to deal with matters and address and go forward

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:33.440
in life. We understand that our Bibles teach us that His name shall be called Wonderful

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:41.000
Counselor. Amen? And it goes on from there. There's not the only two names that are listed,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.839
but I want you to think about the truth that our God gives us counsel. He's given us His

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:53.399
Word, and His Word is profitable. The reality is that as we begin to examine issues and

00:17:53.399 --> 00:17:59.000
matters and we begin to face conflicts, that we must go to the Bible and seek the mind

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.320
of Christ to know the counsel that God would give us for moving forward, for doing the

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.679
will of God. It must not be that we sit back and we begin to, well, what are your thoughts?

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:17.399
What's your opinion? And how should we? No, no, we must make sure the Bible is the text

00:18:17.399 --> 00:18:24.360
that we go to in order to determine the path forward. Notice this morning, Paul says in

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.640
verse number seven, so that contrary wise, you ought rather, here's the first point of

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:37.159
Paul's counsel, to forgive Him. To forgive Him. Now think about that. There were some,

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:41.119
it seems, as you look at the conflict there in Corinth, there were some that probably

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:46.359
sat back and said, I don't believe that He's sincere. I'm not going to forgive. He doesn't

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:50.599
deserve to be forgiven. I'm being a little fastidious this morning, but that's sometimes

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:56.640
how people talk. Is it not? You've lived life long enough. I'm not preaching the junior

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.000
church this morning. You understand how this thing works. And the reality is that we come

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.400
in and Paul says, hey, you ought to forgive Him. You ought to forgive Him. But then notice

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:20.679
he goes on from there. He says, and comfort Him. Well, I'm going to forgive Him, but I

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:25.599
can't forget. It doesn't mean I have to talk to Him anymore. It doesn't mean I have to

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:37.720
be nice to Him. I mean, God tells me I have to forgive Him. Comfort Him. Comfort Him.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.760
We dealt with that in 2 Corinthians 1, that God comforts us. What do we say that it means?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:54.119
It means that He comes alongside us to encourage us and to strengthen us. Comfort Him. Comfort

00:19:54.119 --> 00:20:00.479
Him. That goes beyond sometimes what we have drawn a circle.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:03.479
or a boundary, if you will, around us and say,

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:05.479
that's as far as I'm going.

00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:11.479
He says, forgive him, comfort him.

00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:14.479
And I want you to notice the end of verse number seven

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:19.479
because it's so important where the Apostle Paul

00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:22.479
is trying to help us.

00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:25.479
Obviously, God giving us the truth here this morning.

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:28.479
He's trying to help us, yes, to understand a situation

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:31.479
and circumstance in Corinth, but also to understand

00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:34.479
how we would handle said matters in our own lives.

00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:37.479
And here's what he says, to forgive him

00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:39.479
and to comfort him in verse number seven,

00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:41.479
lest, notice the end of the verse,

00:20:41.479 --> 00:20:46.479
perhaps such in one should be swallowed up

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:49.479
with over much sorrow.

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:53.479
I want to ask you a question this morning.

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:58.479
I almost said if, but I'm going to say when.

00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:01.479
Because it's not a matter of if, it's going to happen in life.

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.479
You're going to offend somebody.

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:07.479
You're going to be the one that's wrong.

00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:11.479
And let me ask you this morning, do you want to be forgiven?

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:16.479
Do you want to be comforted?

00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:20.479
Do you want to know that you've been restored?

00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:27.479
And this morning Paul says, forgive him, comfort him.

00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:31.479
But then he goes on, there's a third point that he makes

00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:34.479
in verse number eight.

00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:36.479
He says, wherefore I beseech you.

00:21:36.479 --> 00:21:38.479
Now let me just pause there for a moment

00:21:38.479 --> 00:21:40.479
because we understand that language.

00:21:40.479 --> 00:21:42.479
The Apostle Paul had used that language

00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:44.479
in other portions of Scripture.

00:21:44.479 --> 00:21:47.479
One of the ones that's probably the most familiar to us

00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:49.479
is Romans chapter number 12, when he says,

00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:52.479
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God,

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.479
that you present your body as a living sacrifice,

00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:58.479
holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service,

00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:00.479
and be not conformed to this world,

00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:02.479
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

00:22:02.479 --> 00:22:04.479
that you may prove what is that good and perfect

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:06.479
and acceptable will of God.

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:08.479
And the reality is that we come to this,

00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:10.479
and Paul says, I beseech you.

00:22:10.479 --> 00:22:13.479
Literally, I'm begging you

00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:18.479
that ye would, notice what it says,

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:23.479
confirm your love toward him.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:29.479
So look at this three-step plan

00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:32.479
that is provided to the church in Corinth

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:37.479
that serves for us this morning as a great example

00:22:37.479 --> 00:22:40.479
of how we too are to forgive.

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:43.479
He says, forgive him.

00:22:43.479 --> 00:22:46.479
Comfort him.

00:22:46.479 --> 00:22:51.479
Confirm your love toward him.

00:22:53.479 --> 00:22:57.479
Sometimes we may think that if we do step one,

00:22:57.479 --> 00:22:59.479
we're really something.

00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:02.479
I mean, we have forgiven them.

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:05.479
And it's kind of like, Peter, Lord,

00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:07.479
how often shall we forgive them?

00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:09.479
Until seven times?

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:10.479
Right?

00:23:10.479 --> 00:23:12.479
Why did he say that?

00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:16.479
The understanding that we have as we read some historical

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.479
and understand some of the cultural things

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:22.479
is that really the common thought

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:25.479
within the religious sect of people

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:27.479
was that if you were to forgive someone

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:31.479
like three or four times, that was really something.

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:33.479
Till seven?

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:35.479
I say not unto you till seven times,

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:40.479
but till 70 times seven.

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:43.479
Is that what the Bible says?

00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:45.479
So you get your little notebook out,

00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:47.479
and you keep track,

00:23:47.479 --> 00:23:49.479
and they get to number 489,

00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:51.479
and you're like, man, one more time,

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:53.479
and I don't have to forgive them anymore.

00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.479
Can I tell you, if that's your approach,

00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:59.479
you do not understand what Christ is saying.

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.479
You just keep forgiving.

00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:04.479
And you keep forgiving.

00:24:04.479 --> 00:24:07.479
And you keep forgiving.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:10.479
Because you have been forgiven.

00:24:10.479 --> 00:24:14.479
And every time you go to God,

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:16.479
today when you sin,

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:18.479
and you go to God, and you say,

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:20.479
God, I confess it.

00:24:20.479 --> 00:24:23.479
It's not a matter of, God, if I did something wrong.

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:26.479
No, you know you did.

00:24:26.479 --> 00:24:33.479
He is faithful and just to forgive us.

00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:36.479
And so this idea where we might think

00:24:36.479 --> 00:24:39.479
as Peter did, that man, I've forgiven him,

00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:40.479
and I've done my duty.

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:45.479
No, Paul says forgive him, comfort him.

00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:50.479
Confirm your love toward him.

00:24:50.479 --> 00:24:53.479
This is an arena this morning

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:56.479
that I believe that many of us

00:24:56.479 --> 00:24:58.479
in our Christian lives

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:02.479
have absolutely never even considered

00:25:02.479 --> 00:25:05.479
that it would go that far.

00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:08.479
Because when we get offended,

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:12.479
we act real carnal.

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:13.479
Can I just be honest this morning?

00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:17.479
When we get offended, we act real carnal.

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:19.479
We do.

00:25:19.479 --> 00:25:21.479
We get our feelings hurt.

00:25:21.479 --> 00:25:24.479
And we get our little pity party going.

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:30.479
And we get our fences up.

00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:32.479
But here the Bible says,

00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:36.479
forgive him, comfort him.

00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:38.479
And then it says that we're to confirm

00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:42.479
your love toward him.

00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:43.479
Man.

00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:45.479
You say, Pastor, why are you believing the point?

00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:46.479
Because we need to.

00:25:46.479 --> 00:25:48.479
Because I think it's a truth that's been

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:52.479
glossed over for far too long

00:25:52.479 --> 00:25:54.479
within the church

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:58.479
of what does forgiveness really look like.

00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:01.479
I hear of evangelists that give

00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:04.479
accounts of being in churches.

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:06.479
You, if you were here,

00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:08.479
I think a time or two ago

00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:10.479
when Brother Paul Mershon preached

00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:12.479
from this pulpit for one of our fall revival meetings,

00:26:12.479 --> 00:26:14.479
he actually shared the story,

00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:16.479
the experience that he had

00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:18.479
of being in a church that he was preaching

00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:19.479
at a revival meeting.

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:22.479
And just a spirit amongst the church

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:24.479
where he just felt like there was no liberty,

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:27.479
that he felt like there was no freedom to preach.

00:26:27.479 --> 00:26:29.479
And he begins to just really

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:32.479
just praying about this and laboring over this

00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:34.479
and what's going on here

00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:37.479
and why is there no liberty?

00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:39.479
And he finds out that there's a fellow

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:42.479
that sits over here in this part of this church

00:26:42.479 --> 00:26:43.479
and there's a fellow that sits over here

00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:44.479
in this part of the church

00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:47.479
and they had a falling out 15 years ago

00:26:47.479 --> 00:26:49.479
and they've not been able to speak

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:51.479
one kind word to one another

00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:53.479
and they're at enmity and at odds one with another

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:55.479
and everyone within the church knows it

00:26:55.479 --> 00:26:57.479
and it's just going on and it's going on.

00:26:57.479 --> 00:26:59.479
And listen, that's not how God

00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:02.479
has told us to deal with things.

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:09.479
Forgive, comfort, confirm your love toward Him.

00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:11.479
Now notice as we continue looking in here

00:27:11.479 --> 00:27:13.479
in verse number nine the Bible says,

00:27:13.479 --> 00:27:15.479
notice what Paul says,

00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:17.479
for to this end also did I write

00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:21.479
that I may know the proof of you

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:24.479
whether ye be obedient in all things.

00:27:24.479 --> 00:27:26.479
Now this is an interesting verse of Scripture.

00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:28.479
I mean Paul says here,

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:30.479
I'm writing this to you to understand

00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:32.479
are you going to be obedient in all things?

00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:35.479
You were obedient when it came to judgment.

00:27:35.479 --> 00:27:37.479
Are you going to be obedient

00:27:37.479 --> 00:27:39.479
when it comes to forgiveness and restoration?

00:27:39.479 --> 00:27:42.479
Can I tell you that the most,

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:44.479
the common human being

00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:47.479
is much more ready to deal with judgment

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:51.479
than they are to deal with forgiveness and restoration.

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:54.479
It takes a spiritual work

00:27:55.479 --> 00:27:57.479
of the Holy Spirit of God

00:27:57.479 --> 00:27:59.479
working in your heart and my heart

00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:02.479
to forgive and restore.

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:06.479
Sometimes we're quick to judge.

00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:10.479
Oh, Paul said judge, man, we're going to lay it on them.

00:28:10.479 --> 00:28:15.479
Paul says forgive, comfort, confirm your love.

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:18.479
Are you going to be obedient in all things?

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:20.479
I'm writing this to you, he says,

00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:22.479
for to this end also did I write

00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:24.479
that I might know the proof of you,

00:28:24.479 --> 00:28:26.479
whether ye be obedient in all things.

00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:29.479
You were obedient in the judgment part.

00:28:29.479 --> 00:28:31.479
And that's good.

00:28:31.479 --> 00:28:33.479
But are you going to be obedient

00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:35.479
in the forgiveness and restoration part?

00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:38.479
Well, I just can't do it.

00:28:38.479 --> 00:28:41.479
You just don't know how.

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:43.479
Can I tell you this morning that forgiveness

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:46.479
is a pillar of biblical Christianity?

00:28:46.479 --> 00:28:50.479
It is a pillar of biblical Christianity.

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:52.479
Can I tell you this morning that what you can't do,

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:54.479
God can do through you?

00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:56.479
Can I tell you this morning that God

00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:58.479
has never given to His people

00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:00.479
a command that He does not expect us

00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:02.479
to be able to obey,

00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:04.479
that He does not give us the power

00:29:04.479 --> 00:29:07.479
and the ability to obey?

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.479
Notice with me a couple of verses of Scripture.

00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:11.479
I told you we'd look at some.

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:13.479
Matthew 18, I referenced it just a moment ago.

00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:15.479
But I want you to see it in your own Bible

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.479
so you don't think I'm just quoting something

00:29:17.479 --> 00:29:19.479
and making something up here.

00:29:19.479 --> 00:29:21.479
Notice what the Bible says.

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:24.479
This is right after the Lord Jesus Christ

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:26.479
deals with church discipline

00:29:26.479 --> 00:29:28.479
in verses 15-20.

00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:30.479
In verse 21,

00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:32.479
then came Peter to Him and said,

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:34.479
Lord, how oft

00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:36.479
shall my brother sin against me

00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:38.479
and I forgive him?

00:29:38.479 --> 00:29:40.479
Till seven times

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:43.479
Jesus saith unto him,

00:29:43.479 --> 00:29:46.479
I say not unto thee until seven times,

00:29:46.479 --> 00:29:50.479
but until seventy times seven.

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:54.479
Notice in Luke chapter 17.

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:56.479
Notice what the Bible says in Luke 17.

00:29:56.479 --> 00:30:00.479
This is a passage of Scripture that we use.

00:30:00.479 --> 00:30:04.399
is really several years ago, verse number five.

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:06.839
And as I preached on this, increase our faith,

00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:08.279
we dealt with it in the very first Sunday

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:09.959
of that particular calendar year

00:30:09.959 --> 00:30:12.879
of looking at the context of this whole passage

00:30:12.879 --> 00:30:14.599
and where they say increase our faith.

00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:18.559
But notice in verse number one of Luke 17,

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:21.959
then said he, this is Jesus speaking to the disciples,

00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:24.819
it is impossible, but the defenses will come.

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:26.459
But woe unto him through whom they come,

00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:27.879
it were better for him that a millstone

00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:29.919
were hanged about his neck,

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:31.199
and he cast him to the sea,

00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:33.359
then that he should offend one of these little ones.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:36.239
Then he says this, take heed to yourselves.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:40.159
If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him,

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:44.079
and if you repent, forgive him.

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:46.959
Verse number three, the teaching of Jesus

00:30:46.959 --> 00:30:49.759
in a single verse of scripture is what's illustrated

00:30:49.759 --> 00:30:51.599
in 2 Corinthians chapter number two.

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:54.599
If a brother offends you, rebuke him, that's what they did.

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:58.059
He was in gross immoral sin.

00:30:58.059 --> 00:30:59.679
1 Corinthians five, go back and read it,

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:01.279
you'll see what's going on.

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:02.959
In 1 Corinthians chapter number five, Paul says,

00:31:02.959 --> 00:31:05.319
judge, he deals with it, he was rebuked.

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:08.199
And it says, if he repent, and it seems as if

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.439
as you read the scriptures that this man repented,

00:31:10.439 --> 00:31:12.539
then what is your duty, forgive him.

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:16.079
Paul lays it out to forgive, to comfort,

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.279
to confirm your love.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.519
Notice he says in verse number four,

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:22.599
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day.

00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:25.759
Now just think about that for a moment.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:28.199
I don't know how your day goes,

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:30.599
but for most of us, after about three or four times,

00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:32.199
if the same person's offended you that day,

00:31:32.199 --> 00:31:35.239
you're probably not gonna wanna be in this presence.

00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:36.079
You know what I'm saying?

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:37.199
You're gonna wanna, like, I need to get away,

00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:40.039
I need to get out of this situation, I can't.

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:42.239
He says, if thy brother, notice,

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:44.639
if he trespass against thee seven times in a day,

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:46.339
and seven times in a day, turn again to thee,

00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:49.939
saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.819
And notice what it says.

00:31:52.819 --> 00:31:57.819
The apostles said unto the Lord, increase our faith.

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:02.439
What a great response to the teaching of Jesus

00:32:02.439 --> 00:32:07.439
on forgiveness, increase my faith, help me.

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:10.239
Think about our theme for this year.

00:32:10.239 --> 00:32:13.879
God's grace is sufficient.

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:17.879
If God's told us to forgive, to comfort,

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:19.559
and to confirm our love toward him,

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.839
as we find in 2 Corinthians chapter two,

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:25.479
verses six and seven, or verse seven and eight,

00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:26.959
I would say to you this morning

00:32:26.959 --> 00:32:28.999
that God's grace is sufficient,

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:32.799
that God will help you do what God has instructed us to do.

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.839
I reference Galatians 6, one,

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:36.999
ye that are spiritual, restore such in one.

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:40.159
I reference Ephesians four, in verse number 32,

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:42.639
where the Bible says, and be kind one to another,

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:44.999
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:48.879
even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

00:32:48.879 --> 00:32:52.219
You know what really helps us to forgive one another?

00:32:52.219 --> 00:32:54.479
Is when we remember that we've been forgiven.

00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:57.999
You know when we don't want to forgive someone else?

00:32:57.999 --> 00:32:59.919
When we're in the flesh,

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.559
and we're thinking about how we were hurt,

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:03.639
and how you don't know what they said,

00:33:03.639 --> 00:33:04.959
you don't know what they did.

00:33:04.959 --> 00:33:06.899
Do you know what you did to Christ?

00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:14.239
Do you remember what Jesus said of the ones

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:18.879
that were beating him, mocking him,

00:33:18.879 --> 00:33:20.959
putting him on that cross?

00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:24.799
He said, Father, forgive them,

00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:27.659
for they know not what they do.

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:31.599
What a great example for us this morning.

00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:34.159
See, when I remember that I've been forgiven,

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:37.739
it goes a long way to me forgiving someone else.

00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:40.339
And it doesn't end with just, well, I forgave him,

00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:42.239
but man, it doesn't mean I have to be nice to him.

00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:44.479
It doesn't mean I have to talk to him.

00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:46.979
Check your heart, seriously.

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:49.239
I'm not saying that you should put yourself

00:33:49.239 --> 00:33:52.479
in a position to continue to be taken advantage of,

00:33:52.479 --> 00:33:54.399
and abused, and so on and so forth,

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:57.619
but the reality is that we've been given this instruction.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.859
We must understand the entirety

00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:02.559
of the counsel that is given.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.839
Number three, as we go through the text of Scripture

00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:05.899
and finish up this morning,

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:08.079
we saw the conflict in Corinth.

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.539
We noted the counsel that Paul gave,

00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:14.199
and now I want you to see that Paul's concern

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.639
is given to us in verse 11.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.079
Let me read verse 10.

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:19.959
To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.

00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:22.159
For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it,

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.919
for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:29.839
And again, just following up on that truth of forgiving.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.439
But then we come to verse number 11,

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:33.119
and it's in verse number 11

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:36.639
that Paul's concern is revealed to us.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.599
See, the apostle Paul was aware of the reality

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.699
that we have an enemy.

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:42.759
We have an enemy.

00:34:43.759 --> 00:34:47.439
And the apostle Paul understood that the enemy works

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:51.999
and the enemy seeks to get advantage of us.

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:54.599
In fact, it says in verse number 11,

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:58.679
lest Satan should get an advantage of us,

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:02.399
for we are not ignorant of his devices.

00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:04.959
We understand this morning that we have this enemy.

00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:06.959
Ephesians chapter six, if you would,

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:08.119
just turn there for a moment.

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:10.359
I want to read a few verses of Scripture to you

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:14.239
because the apostle Paul was keenly aware of this reality

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:17.679
that God's people are facing an enemy, an adversary,

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:21.079
a Satan that is the accuser of the brethren,

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:24.879
that is the one that wants to devour you.

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:29.439
Paul writes of this to the church in Ephesus

00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:32.239
in Ephesians chapter six, beginning in verse number 10,

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.419
where Paul says, finally, my brethren,

00:35:34.419 --> 00:35:36.839
be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:38.679
Put on the whole armor of God

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.759
that you may be able to stand

00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:41.719
against the wiles of the devil.

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:44.159
Notice, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:46.379
but against principalities, against powers,

00:35:46.379 --> 00:35:48.559
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:51.279
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:53.519
How many of you have learned in your Christian life

00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:57.519
that this battle, this war, it's a spiritual war?

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:01.119
I believe it was Tozer said it best,

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:04.439
the Christian life is better described as a battlefield,

00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:07.599
not a playground, a battleground, not a playground.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:12.079
And it's true, we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:14.159
He says in verse 13, wherefore,

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:15.759
take unto you the whole armor of God

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:17.919
that you may be able to withstand in the evil day,

00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:20.519
and having done all to stand, stand therefore,

00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:22.519
having your loins girt about with truth

00:36:22.519 --> 00:36:24.519
and having on the breastplate of righteousness

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:26.519
and your feet shod with the preparation

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:29.319
of the gospel of peace above all,

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:30.959
taking the shield of faith,

00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:33.199
wherewith ye shall be able to quench

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:35.279
all the fiery darts of the wicked

00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:36.719
and take the helmet of salvation

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:39.399
and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.

00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:41.599
Notice verse 18, praying always

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.639
with all prayer and supplication in the spirit

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:45.759
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:49.239
and supplication for all saints.

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:52.079
Listen, we need to put on the whole armor of God.

00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.799
We need to be prayed up.

00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:57.999
We see in verse 18, the importance of prayer.

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:00.479
Paul was aware of this.

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:02.559
In fact, Paul had experienced this

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:05.559
in 1 Thessalonians chapter two, in verse number 18,

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:08.199
the Bible says that Paul makes reference

00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:09.799
to the fact that he had planned

00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:12.319
to go to Thessalonica once and again,

00:37:12.319 --> 00:37:16.159
but Satan hindered us, is what Paul says

00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:18.759
in 1 Thessalonians two, in verse number 18.

00:37:18.759 --> 00:37:20.999
It's Peter that stands there

00:37:20.999 --> 00:37:22.519
in 1 Peter chapter number five and says,

00:37:22.519 --> 00:37:24.759
be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary,

00:37:24.759 --> 00:37:26.159
the devil is a roaring lion,

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:29.439
walketh about seeking whom he may devour,

00:37:29.439 --> 00:37:34.439
whom resists steadfast in the faith.

00:37:34.479 --> 00:37:37.079
Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:39.199
in your brethren that are in the world.

00:37:39.199 --> 00:37:42.399
Listen, Satan wants to get an advantage of us.

00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:45.399
Can I tell you this morning that the context

00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:46.799
of 2 Corinthians chapter two

00:37:46.799 --> 00:37:49.359
is speaking of the church corporately?

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.079
Can I just pause for a moment and tell you

00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:53.719
that Satan wants to devour you individually?

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:56.279
He wants to destroy you.

00:37:56.279 --> 00:37:57.879
He wants to devour you.

00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:01.879
By the way, I'm about sick and tired of the enemy.

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.119
I'm serious.

00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:07.479
I've had to deal with things that I can't say publicly

00:38:07.479 --> 00:38:11.079
from people that are dealing with the attack of the enemy

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:16.079
that just makes me mad at the enemy,

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.039
because he's trying to destroy people.

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:20.479
I'm talking about some young people this morning.

00:38:26.399 --> 00:38:27.959
He wants to devour you.

00:38:28.879 --> 00:38:30.199
This is not a game.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:32.880
It's not a game.

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:37.119
I shared some things with Joseph last week.

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:39.079
He said, why are you so worked up?

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:42.760
Because it's real.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.159
It had nothing to do with Joseph, zero.

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:48.199
Zero.

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.320
But because of other things that were going on,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.639
I went to my son.

00:38:53.919 --> 00:38:57.199
I said, I want you to know, this is real.

00:38:57.199 --> 00:38:58.919
It's not the first time I've ever had that conversation

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:00.000
with him, by the way.

00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:02.079
He said, why are you so worked up?

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:03.320
Listen, we better get worked up

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.719
over what the enemy is doing to our young people.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:10.159
It's about time that we recognize that we have an enemy,

00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:13.239
and he's trying to destroy and devour.

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:17.959
Within the context of 2 Corinthians,

00:39:17.959 --> 00:39:20.119
he wants to gain an advantage of the church.

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:24.799
He wants to destroy us as individuals.

00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:26.799
He wants to destroy us as a community.

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:28.719
He wants to destroy us as a nation.

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:30.799
He wants to destroy us as individuals.

00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:33.279
He wants to destroy us corporately, collectively.

00:39:34.919 --> 00:39:36.239
He'd love nothing more

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:41.479
than if this church didn't sit on this hill anymore.

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.760
I'm being honest with you.

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.359
He'd love nothing more

00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:50.279
than to destroy your life and your family and our church.

00:39:50.279 --> 00:39:51.880
It's what the enemy wants to do.

00:39:53.919 --> 00:39:58.119
And we can think of all of the quote-unquote big sins,

00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:00.000
but when you think of all of those,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.239
you can think about what's coming to them.

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:07.679
And we understand the truth of Ai, that there was sin in the camp.

00:40:07.679 --> 00:40:10.479
We understand the truth that a little leavened, leavened the whole lump.

00:40:10.479 --> 00:40:13.979
We understand those principles.

00:40:13.979 --> 00:40:20.359
But can I tell you this morning that the subject that Paul's dealing with is forgiveness.

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:24.239
It's forgiveness, because when we don't forgive, you know what happens?

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:26.939
You get bitter.

00:40:26.939 --> 00:40:30.779
You get bitter, you read Hebrews 13, God talks about bitterness.

00:40:30.979 --> 00:40:34.539
I've said this for years.

00:40:34.539 --> 00:40:40.699
Bitterness will destroy the vessel in which it is stored more than the vessel in which

00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:42.979
it is poured.

00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:52.139
Listen, this subject of forgiveness, Paul's not dealing with the same level of some of

00:40:52.139 --> 00:40:57.019
the sin that we could talk about this morning that we think of, man this is, and I'm not

00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:59.779
saying that those are things that we should pass over.

00:40:59.779 --> 00:41:03.899
Those are important things to understand, but this morning he says listen, when I talk

00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:10.579
about the subject of forgiveness and the importance of you church and Corinth forgiving and comforting

00:41:10.579 --> 00:41:16.219
and confirming your love toward this one, I want you to understand that I'm concerned

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:24.779
why lest Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.

00:41:24.779 --> 00:41:30.299
I'm so thankful this morning that God has exposed the tactics of our enemy.

00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:32.479
We are not ignorant of his devices.

00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:36.779
Can I tell you this morning that the enemy has no new tricks?

00:41:36.779 --> 00:41:38.399
He really doesn't.

00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:42.619
You study the scriptures, you can find a whole lot of the tactics of the enemy by reading

00:41:42.619 --> 00:41:45.119
the scriptures.

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:50.779
You begin to find these tactics and you say this just is in a new era, but it's the same

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:51.779
old trick.

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:55.059
I mentioned this several weeks ago as we looked at the beginning of 2 Corinthians chapter

00:41:55.059 --> 00:41:59.339
number 1, dealing with the comfort and the need for that encouragement, that one of

00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:04.419
the tools that Satan often goes to in his toolbox is the tool of discouragement.

00:42:04.419 --> 00:42:09.659
He wants to discourage people and get them in a place of not doing anything for the cause

00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:12.499
of Christ because they're just discouraged and they're overwhelmed.

00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:19.539
But can I tell you with the subject of forgiveness, Paul says as we look at this passage that

00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:25.099
the failure to forgive will lead not only to bitterness but to more division.

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:30.099
And Paul wants to ensure us this morning and he wants to ensure these believers at Corinth

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:35.859
that our behavior must be proper, that our behavior, our approach to dealing with subjects

00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:43.299
and matters must be biblical and we must not give place to the enemy.

00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:47.539
Notice what the Bible says in Ephesians 4, we've referenced already verse 32 a couple

00:42:47.539 --> 00:42:51.899
of times this morning, but I want to go earlier in the text of Scripture and in Ephesians

00:42:51.899 --> 00:43:00.139
chapter number 4, in verses 26 and 27, again they are familiar verses of Scripture, it's

00:43:00.139 --> 00:43:04.139
actually in this passage that he's dealing with the put off and put on principle that

00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:06.659
we mentioned at the beginning of the service this morning.

00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:11.539
We see it also referenced in the book of Colossians, but notice here in verse 26, the Bible says

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:21.099
be angry and sin not, let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:23.379
the devil.

00:43:23.379 --> 00:43:28.419
You know there are things in this context in Ephesians chapter number 4, being angry

00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:33.179
and he says be angry and sin not, but he says let not the sun go down upon your wrath, deal

00:43:33.179 --> 00:43:34.179
with it.

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:37.739
You know what happens so often, we just let it kind of simmer.

00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:40.019
You know what happens to a simmering pot?

00:43:40.019 --> 00:43:41.019
It overflows.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:47.499
You ever hear the expression, it's the hair or the straw that broke the camel's back.

00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:52.099
You just let something simmer long enough and bother you and fester long enough, it's

00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:56.859
going to come out eventually and most likely it's going to come out in a bad way.

00:43:56.859 --> 00:43:59.499
It's going to be ugly, right?

00:43:59.499 --> 00:44:02.699
And all of a sudden you're going to get historical about something that happened 14 years ago

00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:06.819
and the person's going to be looking at you like what in the world?

00:44:06.819 --> 00:44:10.739
And you're going to remember every single point, every single minute and all this stuff

00:44:10.739 --> 00:44:14.379
and it's just going to be a mess.

00:44:14.379 --> 00:44:18.339
He says let not the sun go down upon your wrath and then he says this, neither give

00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:21.579
place to the devil.

00:44:21.579 --> 00:44:26.000
Contextually dealing with anger, I would say that we can take and use this principle from

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.099
verse number 27 of giving place to the devil that we can give place, we can leave that

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:36.959
open opportunity for the devil to come in and attack and divide and cause all kinds

00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:41.660
of problems and as we look at that truth and apply it to 2 Corinthians chapter number 2,

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:47.079
it's with the subject matter of not forgiving.

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:50.139
I don't want to give place to the devil.

00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:52.380
I don't want to give place to the devil.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:58.660
Listen he is, you know what Michael said, the Lord rebuked thee.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:03.679
You read the book of Jude, I think it's verse number 9, when he does bring a railing accusation

00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:10.380
about the body of Moses, he said the Lord rebuked thee.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:15.220
This morning we better learn to forgive.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:24.139
I don't know what someone, what many someones may be dealing with but I know this morning

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:32.459
that 2 Corinthians, more so, I read this book a number of times in the last quarter

00:45:32.459 --> 00:45:36.339
in preparation for our series of 2025.

00:45:36.339 --> 00:45:40.459
I do that every year when I'm getting ready to do a new study, I just, I keep doing my

00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:44.099
normal Bible reading but then I just read whatever book I'm going to preach to and I

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:48.019
just read it and re-read it and re-read it and re-read it and read it again and read

00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:49.019
it again.

00:45:49.019 --> 00:45:59.339
Can I tell you this morning, it's so much more applicable than what I realized even

00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:06.859
in reading it over and over and over again in the last quarter of last year.

00:46:06.859 --> 00:46:14.220
This is where we live, this is where we live, and the subject of forgiveness, it is a pillar

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.339
of biblical Christianity.

00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:23.380
I said three weeks ago, we all need to be comforted because we deal with sorrow.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:27.179
I said a couple of weeks ago, we all have been misunderstood at some point and we need

00:46:27.179 --> 00:46:29.059
to learn how to deal with that.

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:34.779
We've all been offended and we need to learn how to deal with forgiveness, biblically deal

00:46:34.779 --> 00:46:35.779
with forgiveness.

00:46:35.779 --> 00:46:37.259
Let us pray.

00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:39.199
Father, we love you.

00:46:39.199 --> 00:46:40.899
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:49.139
God, I pray this morning that your Holy Spirit would have His will and way.

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:53.940
Possibly this morning there's someone here that is not saved.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.940
They've never been forgiven of their sin by you.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:04.139
Lord, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation, that they would recognize

00:47:04.139 --> 00:47:07.940
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:47:07.979 --> 00:47:12.339
They'd recognize that you died for them, but God commendeth His love toward us and that

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:15.779
while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:21.419
They'd understand the gift of God, see the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God

00:47:21.419 --> 00:47:23.859
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:27.539
They'd understand that wonderful promise, for whosoever shall call upon the name of

00:47:27.539 --> 00:47:29.940
the Lord shall be saved.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:34.099
Or if there's someone this morning that needs to be saved and to be born again, I pray that

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:39.660
you would work and move and Lord, help us to have the opportunity to talk to them.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.220
Or maybe there's some folks here this morning that are dealing with an unforgiving spirit

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:51.419
or they've been hurt and I'm not discounting that hurt, just simply saying that your grace

00:47:51.419 --> 00:47:52.419
is greater.

00:47:52.419 --> 00:47:57.380
And God, you've given us instruction for how to deal with that hurt and how to forgive

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.819
and comfort and confirm our love.

00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:06.660
God, the purpose is restoration, not excommunication.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.019
I pray, Father, that you'd help us to be biblical.

00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:16.619
We say as Baptists that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and for practice.

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:26.299
This text this morning squarely addresses our practice.

00:48:26.299 --> 00:48:27.299
How do we forgive?

00:48:28.299 --> 00:48:30.299
We've been instructed to forgive.

00:48:30.299 --> 00:48:34.299
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be biblical.

00:48:34.299 --> 00:48:38.299
I pray that you'd work and move as only you can.

00:48:38.299 --> 00:48:39.299
We'll thank you for it.

00:48:39.299 --> 00:48:40.299
In Christ's name we pray.

00:48:40.299 --> 00:48:41.299
We just ask.

00:48:41.299 --> 00:48:41.299
