WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
Last week, we introduced the theme for 2024, continue.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.100
I preached a message really from 2 Timothy 3 in verse 14

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.399
and a theme message, kind of an overview of the entire year.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.800
And this morning we'll begin in 1 Timothy chapter number one

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.079
by God's grace and with God's help

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.959
throughout this calendar year on Sunday mornings,

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.920
we will study through 1 and 2 Timothy.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.520
And I look forward to the opportunity

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.159
to be able to go through both of these letters.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.120
And we understand that the exhortation to continue

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.040
is an important one.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.880
And throughout this calendar year,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.639
we will regularly hear the thought,

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.000
the exhortation, the encouragement,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.240
we'll hear the word continue.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
And you'll see it on the banners each week that you come,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.840
it'll be on your calendars, bookmarks, sermon notebooks,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.240
just this thought of continue.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.639
I would say this morning that understanding the charge

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.919
and really even accepting the call to continue

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.400
is important.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.479
It's an important step for every believer

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.959
to understand the charge and then to accept the call.

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.319
However, it's simply not enough.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.519
It's not enough to simply understand

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.000
that we have been exhorted to continue.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.480
It's simply not enough to even say, I'm going to continue.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.760
I find this morning that there's little doubt in my mind

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.599
that there are believers that have understood the charge.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.959
There are believers that have even at one point in their life

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.720
accepted the call, but somewhere along the line,

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:37.639
they got derailed.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.959
They got detoured, distracted.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.519
They just simply aren't continuing.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.000
And we find that as we look at this portion,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.680
as we enter into the first few verses of 1 Timothy,

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.360
chapter number one,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.440
I believe this morning that the Lord gives us

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.279
two fundamental truths.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.599
These fundamental truths that God gives us

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.919
in 1 Timothy one, one through four

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:07.919
are essential for every child of God to believe,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.639
to understand.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.399
I believe this morning that these two truths

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.240
will enable us to continue.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.320
I've titled the message this morning equipped to continue.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.720
Equipped to continue.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080
It's not enough to simply understand the charge.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.600
It's not enough to even accept the call.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.199
We must be equipped to continue.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.399
There are people no doubt in a variety of phases of life

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.199
that we could speak of a variety of areas

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:37.960
where people have desired to continue on

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.240
and they desired, they understood the importance,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.279
but they simply didn't have the resources.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.479
They were not equipped to go another step.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.440
I'd like to tell you this morning

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.000
that we find that our equipping comes from God.

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.279
And how blessed we are to have these few introductory verses

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.440
to the book of 1 Timothy and understand how Timothy

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.600
is given this truth from Paul

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.119
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.839
And as Paul is giving, communicating this truth

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.720
to his son in the faith, Timothy,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.000
really in the very beginning of this book,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.160
we find that Timothy is being equipped

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.960
to continue, he's being equipped.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.479
As we look at the passage of scripture,

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.080
there's just two fundamental truths,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.279
but look in verse number one, as we read the text

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.960
and dig into the message this morning,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.039
the Bible says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.520
by the commandment of God, our savior

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.240
and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.720
Under Timothy, my own son of the faith,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.720
grace, mercy, and peace from God, our father

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.600
and Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.240
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.160
when I went into Macedonia,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.320
that thou mightest charge some

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.279
that they teach no other doctrine,

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.720
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.880
which minister questions rather than godly edifying,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.479
which is in faith, so do.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.800
As I look at the beginning of verse number three

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.639
and the end of verse number four,

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.519
and then we begin to put the meat on the bones,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.279
if you will, for the message this morning,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.839
we find that in verse number three,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.839
Paul says, I besought thee notice to abide still at Ephesus.

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:28.519
That word abide literally means to continue with

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.200
or to continue in.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.359
It means to remain or to stay or tarry.

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.200
And then he says at the end of verse number four,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.440
I've besought thee at the beginning of verse number three

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.920
to abide still at Ephesus.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.279
At the end of verse number four, two words, so do.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.880
So do.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.399
But how do I continue?

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.119
I understand the importance of continuing.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.320
I understand I've accepted the call to continue,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.320
but I must, you must, we must be equipped to continue.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.480
As we look at this portion of scripture,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.040
again, God gives us two fundamental truths

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.119
that I believe will help every child of God.

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:08.239
Number one, if you're taking notes this morning,

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:12.640
we must first understand the provision of God.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.959
We must understand the provision of God.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.760
In order for you to continue, in order for me to continue,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.279
we must understand that it is God who provides us

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.920
with all that we need so that we can continue.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.000
We must understand that it's not in your strength,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.320
it's not in my strength to be able to continue.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.440
No, it's through his enabling, he equips us.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.040
It is his provision.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.200
As we look at these first couple of verses,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.279
we understand that Paul is communicating

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.839
that very truth to Timothy.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.359
Notice, he says in verse number one,

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.440
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.399
by the commandment of God, notice our Savior first,

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.399
when we consider the provision of God,

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:53.519
we must understand that it is God that is our Savior.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.279
I'm thankful that there's no other Savior.

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.880
He is the only Savior,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.279
and we understand his place of being our Savior.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.480
I'm thankful this morning that he saved my soul.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.119
26, 26 and a half years ago,

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.600
he saved me by his amazing grace,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.119
and I'm so thankful that he is my Savior.

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.359
He is my Lord, and we find this morning

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.959
that we think about that truth and that word

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.160
that Paul says, speaking of God being our Savior,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.000
it is God who has provided us with salvation,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.880
this wonderful gift that is only available

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.559
through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.519
and that in itself is what has enlisted us

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.640
into this fight that we're encouraged

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.040
and exhorted to continue.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.239
He's our Savior.

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:37.799
We must never forget.

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:41.279
We must never get over the blessed truth

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.959
that God is my Savior.

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.160
He's the only Savior.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.880
He's the only one,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.559
and I'm thankful that he's my Savior,

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:52.559
but as we look at the text of Scripture,

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.920
we find that he mentions about God being our Savior,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.959
but notice it says at the end of verse number one,

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.839
and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.320
See, he doesn't simply give hope, he is my hope.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.959
We find that the psalmist says,

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.839
you don't need to turn there, I'll read it to you quickly,

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.200
but in Psalm 71 and verse number five,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.559
I preached a message on this thought

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.480
on a Wednesday evening several months ago,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.640
but the Bible says in Psalm 71 and verse five,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.440
for thou art my hope, O Lord God,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.880
thou art my trust from my youth,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.079
and we understand that God,

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:29.279
he doesn't simply give us hope, though he does,

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.839
but he is our hope.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:33.920
We understand that this word hope

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.720
is a word that is so unique biblically.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.440
It's used so different,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.920
the context of the word is used so different

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.279
in our society today, in our language today,

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.720
in our interactions with people,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.640
we talk about hope, and we use the word really

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.679
as some wishful kind of thinking,

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.079
but we understand that the word hope biblically is unique,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.920
and the fact that it carries with it

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.799
the idea of a confident expectancy,

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:03.119
the idea that he is our confidence,

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:06.160
that everything that he has said is true,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.119
and that he is faithful, and he will do, he is my hope.

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.040
You think about the songs that we sang this morning,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.119
when we all get to heaven, why do we sing that song?

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.320
Because he's our hope, and he's told us

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.239
that he's reserved, he's got a place for us,

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:24.000
he is giving us, he's preparing that mansion for us,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.279
and we sang that song as well this morning,

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.079
that second song that we sang,

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.320
and you think about the truth this morning

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.479
that God is our hope.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.479
We find that as we come to verse number two,

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.599
he tells us, it's Paul that's writing,

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:41.919
and he's writing to Timothy,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.400
God has providentially preserved this for us today,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.400
but he says unto Timothy, my own son in the faith,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.239
and notice the third aspect of the provision of God,

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:55.239
he says grace, mercy, and peace

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.000
from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.039
and so we see the three elements that are mentioned

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.239
in verse number two, first he speaks about grace,

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:06.039
I'm so thankful for God's amazing grace,

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.919
I'm thankful that his grace is abundant,

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:10.280
I'm thankful that his grace has been extended to us,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.520
I'm thankful that our God is gracious,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.280
when we think about grace, we think of it,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.960
and we understand the Bible speaks of grace

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.960
in two distinct areas, he speaks of saving grace,

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:25.400
for by grace are you saved through faith,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.840
I'm thankful for God's grace, his saving grace,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.159
but we understand that God doesn't only speak of grace

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.080
in the sense of saving grace,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.640
but he also speaks of grace as serving grace,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.440
or his enabling, and we find that really,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.840
as we look at the context of what Paul is dealing with,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.039
and thinking about being equipped to continue,

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.320
and understanding the provision of God,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.280
we understand this morning that we're saved by grace,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.760
but then we understand that God gives us grace

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.000
each and every day, I'm thankful that in

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.880
2 Corinthians chapter 12, that God,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.039
as Paul is sharing.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.599
that testimony about the trial and trouble

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:05.339
that he's dealing with, and God says,

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.879
no, I'm not going to remove this thing from you.

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:13.239
But God says, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:19.359
And I understand this morning that God's grace is sufficient.

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:21.839
Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.559
speaking of this grace, this serving grace,

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:26.919
or this enabling grace.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:33.719
Notice in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul speaks of this grace.

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:37.919
Again, we see, obviously, the element of saving grace,

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:40.439
and we're saved by grace.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:43.679
We see the enabling that God gives to his children,

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:47.079
and we find that here in 1 Corinthians 15, in verse 9,

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:48.439
notice what Paul says.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.239
I am the least of the apostles that

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:52.079
am not meet to be called an apostle,

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.439
because I persecuted the church of God.

00:10:54.479 --> 00:11:00.079
But by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:02.899
And notice, and his grace, which was bestowed upon me,

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:04.519
was not in vain.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.139
But I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I,

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:10.439
but the grace of God, which was with me.

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:12.919
Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach,

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.439
and so ye believed.

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:18.999
Peter adds this in 1 Peter chapter 4.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.519
When you think about the truth of God's grace

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.459
and his enabling, and we consider

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:25.979
the provision of God, how is it that I'm

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:28.099
going to be equipped to continue?

00:11:28.099 --> 00:11:31.139
Well, because God is my Savior, and he's never

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:32.699
going to leave me nor forsake me.

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:35.579
We find that we're secure in the hand of God.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:39.339
We find that he, listen, I am his, and he is mine.

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:40.859
And what a blessed truth.

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:43.019
I find this morning that as I'm seeking

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:46.379
to be equipped to continue the understanding,

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:48.299
the provision of God, that he's my hope,

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:50.499
but he also gives grace.

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:51.899
He gives grace.

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.459
In 1 Peter 4 and verse number 10,

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.619
the Bible says, as every man hath received the gift,

00:11:56.619 --> 00:11:59.219
even so minister to the same one to another

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:05.699
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:07.979
God is the one who gives grace.

00:12:07.979 --> 00:12:10.579
And by the way, you're going to need God's grace

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.419
if you're going to continue.

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.099
You're going to need God's grace.

00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:17.539
You're going to have to understand that he is the source.

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:18.459
He is the one that gives.

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.499
Notice what Paul says again in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 2

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:22.819
as he's writing and he's speaking

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.379
about the provision of God.

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:26.539
He says unto Timothy, my own son of the faith,

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:30.499
grace, mercy, and peace from God our father

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.819
and Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.379
He is the source.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:37.139
He is the one who gives us that grace.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:40.499
No doubt you've had some interaction in your life before

00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:41.859
where you've said to somebody,

00:12:41.859 --> 00:12:44.139
would you just be gracious with me?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.939
Maybe you've said, would you show me some mercy?

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:47.499
And we'll see mercy here in just a moment.

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:49.979
But I'm thankful this morning that God's grace

00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:54.339
has been given and he gives us the grace that we need

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:55.419
in order to continue.

00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:59.059
He speaks of mercy here as the second element

00:12:59.059 --> 00:12:59.899
in verse number two.

00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:03.339
He says grace, and so we find that he, our God,

00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:05.419
he gives grace, he gives mercy.

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:07.579
Understand this morning that the reason

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.499
that God gives us grace and the reason that he gives us mercy

00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:13.059
is because he's gracious, because he's merciful.

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.819
It flows out of who he is.

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:18.179
And if you're going to continue,

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:20.059
if you're going to be equipped to continue,

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:22.539
you need to understand the provision of God

00:13:22.539 --> 00:13:24.699
and you need to understand that he's going to give you

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:26.819
the grace, he's going to give you the mercy.

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:29.619
Have you ever heard, maybe you've said something like this

00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:33.299
in your life before, I just can't go another day.

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:36.619
I can't do it anymore.

00:13:36.619 --> 00:13:37.819
I give up.

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:42.459
Listen, don't turn your back on God

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:47.659
because God's grace and God's mercy.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:50.699
And the third element in verse number two is peace.

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:54.979
Oh, you think about the thought of continue,

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:57.379
the charge, the exhortation.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:01.099
And we find that, man, we're going to need peace

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:02.659
in the midst of great turmoil,

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.579
in the midst of great difficulty and opposition

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:07.019
and all that will take place.

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:08.299
We need peace.

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.859
Listen, you cannot manufacture peace.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:17.099
But I'm thankful that I know the Prince of Peace.

00:14:17.099 --> 00:14:18.179
Amen.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:21.299
I'm thankful that he gives peace, that he is the source.

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.459
Notice what John says in John 14.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:26.099
Jesus is speaking, John records it for us,

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:28.579
but notice what Jesus says in John 14.

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:30.739
I love this verse of scripture

00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:34.459
and I love the way that Jesus communicates to his disciples

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:37.899
who he's just shared with them once again,

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:40.979
the fact that he's going to be going to Calvary,

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:43.099
he's going to give his life on the cross

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.699
and their hearts are troubled,

00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:46.579
but he tells them not to have troubled hearts.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:50.459
In John 14 and verse number 27, notice he says,

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:52.819
peace I leave with you.

00:14:55.819 --> 00:15:00.819
Then notice this word, my peace I give unto you.

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:06.539
Then he gives further explanation,

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:11.259
not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:15.739
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:21.139
Oh, I'm so thankful that God is the Prince of Peace

00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:25.059
and I'm so thankful that he has given to us peace.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:27.299
We find here that Jesus would say

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:28.779
that I'm giving you this peace.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:32.019
It's interesting that we find that the Bible

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:35.339
gives us this truth of having the peace of God

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:37.539
in Philippians chapter four and verse number seven,

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:40.659
that passeth all understanding.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:46.219
This morning, if we are going to be equipped to continue,

00:15:46.219 --> 00:15:48.779
if we're going to take this theme for 2024

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:51.539
and we're going to hear the exhortation

00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:54.739
and we're going to study and see how Paul is encouraging

00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:59.019
and exhorting Timothy to continue to abide still at Ephesus

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:01.179
as he uses that term in verse number three,

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:04.259
to continue as he tells them in second Timothy four,

00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:05.579
as we studied last week,

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:08.499
in the midst of all of the opposition and the difficulty

00:16:08.499 --> 00:16:10.619
in those times that are described

00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:13.459
in second Timothy chapter number three, perilous times,

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.299
these days in which evil men and seducers

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:17.859
shall wax worse and worse.

00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:20.899
The single word is continue.

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:24.659
I understand the charge.

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:28.499
I accept the call, but I must be equipped.

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:30.899
And it's God who does the equipping.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:33.739
It is God who gives us and enables us.

00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:36.939
He gives us all that we need.

00:16:36.939 --> 00:16:39.139
And that's a precious truth of the Bible.

00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:40.139
He's given us all things

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:42.859
that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:45.499
We find that the truth of God's word

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.339
that is revealed to us here in this opening statement

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:50.499
as Paul would write to his son in the faith,

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:53.059
that here in the midst of this adversity,

00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:55.299
in the midst of what Timothy would deal with,

00:16:55.299 --> 00:16:59.739
Paul reminds Timothy that God has equipped you.

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.219
He's your savior.

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:02.939
He's your hope.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.819
He gives grace.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.659
He gives mercy and he gives peace.

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:09.939
Oh, I believe this morning

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:13.779
that when we understand the provision of God,

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:16.259
it helps us to recognize

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:19.659
that God has equipped us to continue.

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:21.219
Why? Because it's not within you

00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:23.059
and it's not within me.

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:27.019
You ever read an account of someone's life?

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:28.939
Maybe a Bible character,

00:17:28.939 --> 00:17:31.259
and we read of certain hardships

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.859
and difficulties that they endured,

00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:34.539
and we say, how in the world

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:36.099
did they continue through that?

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:38.819
Maybe you've read of some modern missionary

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:41.859
or servant of the Lord who faced great adversity,

00:17:41.859 --> 00:17:44.459
yet they continued to follow the Lord.

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.979
They continued in the midst of great persecution

00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:49.299
to do what God called them to do.

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:51.419
And you say, what is it about them?

00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:52.819
It's not anything about them.

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:55.019
It's about God in them.

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:57.899
It's about what God has given them.

00:17:57.899 --> 00:18:00.339
So often people will say of the apostle Paul,

00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:02.259
oh, I want to be like Paul.

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:03.699
No, I want the Lord to use me

00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:05.859
in the same manner in which God used Paul,

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:09.219
but understand that Paul was surrendered to the Lord.

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:12.219
Paul was open to God working in his life,

00:18:12.219 --> 00:18:14.139
and Paul understood that it was God

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:16.979
who equipped him to continue

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:20.019
even in the midst of great adversity.

00:18:20.019 --> 00:18:21.499
It was God's provision.

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:25.259
It is God who is the source of these wonderful truths

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:27.579
that he gives us in verse one and two.

00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:30.379
If we're gonna be equipped to continue,

00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:32.779
we must first understand the provision of God.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:33.699
But number two this morning,

00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:36.019
we must understand the plan of God.

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:37.539
Let's understand the plan of God.

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:39.500
I'm thankful this morning that God has a plan.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.500
Aren't you?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.539
You say, well, I have a plan too.

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:44.380
Can I tell you this morning that God's plan is better?

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.219
Amen?

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:47.179
You say, no, no, Pastor, I worked on this plan,

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:49.259
and I mean, it's just perfect.

00:18:49.259 --> 00:18:50.739
It's the best plan ever.

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:52.419
Listen, God's plan is better.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.339
And you know what you ought to be willing to do

00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:56.179
with your plan?

00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:58.820
You ought to be willing to let God rewrite it

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.820
if he desires to do so.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.659
Amen?

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:03.019
We ought to be willing to let God,

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:05.259
if we could use the imagery this morning

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:08.419
to take our plan and ball it up and throw it in the trash

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:11.579
and say, here's my plan, and my plan is better.

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:15.019
Because God's ways are always best.

00:19:15.899 --> 00:19:17.579
We, in fact, sing the song,

00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:22.579
it's best that we let him have his way with us.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:25.219
And this morning, when we understand the plan of God,

00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:28.459
we see that Paul actually shares with us

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:30.979
the fact that he reveals in verse number one

00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:34.219
that he understood God's plan for his own life.

00:19:34.219 --> 00:19:35.779
And then he would speak about Timothy

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:38.059
and we'll focus more on Timothy than we will on Paul.

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:39.779
But notice in verse number one,

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.659
that Paul, as he begins writing to Timothy,

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:46.179
he says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:49.859
So Paul understood that God's plan for his life

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:52.859
was that he was an apostle.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.459
He was an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:57.219
Notice, though, what the Bible says in verse number one,

00:19:57.219 --> 00:19:58.259
as it continues, it says,

00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:02.399
by the commandment of God, by the commandment of God.

00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:04.119
Now, hold your place here in 1 Timothy 1

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:06.319
and turn to 2 Timothy 1.

00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:08.939
And I wanted to see what Paul says

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:10.639
as he's writing this second letter,

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:12.619
again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:14.559
This isn't just, these aren't Paul's words.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.559
These are God's words, amen?

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.159
In fact, in 2 Timothy 3, he will tell us

00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:22.119
all scriptures given by inspiration of God.

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.479
God breathed.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.879
And so we find that these are God's words.

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:27.759
He says in 1 Timothy 1.1

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.319
that I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.439
by the commandment of God.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.159
In 2 Timothy 1 and verse number one,

00:20:33.159 --> 00:20:37.119
it says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:38.479
Do you see what it says?

00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:39.679
By the will of God.

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.239
Now, is it the commandment of God

00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:44.699
or is it the will of God?

00:20:44.699 --> 00:20:45.539
Yes.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.239
Yes.

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:49.459
Why?

00:20:49.459 --> 00:20:51.359
Because God's will for your life

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:54.579
should be viewed as God's command for your life.

00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:57.359
Amen?

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:59.759
And God's command for your life

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:03.199
should be viewed as God's will for your life.

00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:05.799
The reality is that there's no discrepancy

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:08.199
between what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1.1

00:21:08.199 --> 00:21:09.639
and 2 Timothy 1.1.

00:21:09.639 --> 00:21:11.399
It is the will of God

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:13.479
that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:15.419
It is the command of God

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:17.359
that he's an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:21.239
And when Paul understood the plan of God for his life,

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:25.239
it enabled him to continue through great adversity.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:28.639
You wanna look at a man's life who faced great adversity,

00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:30.879
who faced opposition at every turn?

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:32.759
Study the life of Paul.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:37.599
Everywhere he went, he was met with opposition

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.679
and with adversity, yet he continued.

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:41.779
Why?

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:44.239
Because he understood the provision of God,

00:21:44.239 --> 00:21:46.559
but he also understood the plan of God.

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:48.239
He understood that it was God's will,

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:50.439
it was God's command for his life

00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:52.639
that he was an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:54.359
And we find there's many other things

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:56.279
that he would share throughout the scriptures

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:58.839
that we don't have time this morning to deal with

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:02.639
as to what that office of being an apostle

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:06.839
detailed and contained with regard to the outworking of it.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.199
But we find that God's will

00:22:09.199 --> 00:22:11.079
for the life of the apostle Paul

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:13.759
was viewed as a command, not as an option.

00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:18.039
See, sometimes what happens in the life of believers today

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:20.639
is we say, well, God, tell me what you want me to do,

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:22.279
and then I'll kind of evaluate that

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:25.719
and see if it kind of matches what I think I want to do.

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:28.799
Are we bought with a price or not?

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:33.359
We're not our own.

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:36.599
We've been bought with a price.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:39.999
And God's will is God's command,

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:42.559
and God's command is God's will.

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:46.899
Paul understood the plan of God for his life,

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:48.839
but then we find as we look here

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:50.839
in 1 Timothy chapter number one

00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:55.839
that Paul reminds Timothy of God's plan for his life.

00:22:56.719 --> 00:23:00.559
Notice as Paul is writing to Timothy

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.079
in verses three and four,

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:04.959
as we leave the thought of the provision of God

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:08.839
and look, focus on the plan of God and understanding it,

00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:11.279
we find that Paul would remind Timothy

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:13.959
of what God's plan was for the life of Timothy.

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.839
Notice in verse number three, he says,

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:20.839
as I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus.

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:24.359
I've mentioned already by way of introduction

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.999
that that word to abide still,

00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:29.799
it means to continue with or to continue in.

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:33.879
It means to remain, tarry, or stay.

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:36.319
Now understand, and we'll look at this in greater detail

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:38.759
as we get through the remainder of the message this morning,

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:42.639
that the task that God has assigned to Timothy

00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:44.819
is not really an easy task.

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:51.199
But even in the midst of a difficult task,

00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:54.919
the charge is to continue to abide still.

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:55.759
Why?

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:57.959
Because God has a plan for your life.

00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:01.039
Because God has equipped you his provision,

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.799
but also because God has a plan.

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:05.799
Listen, if we don't know what God's plan is,

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.359
it's likely that we're not gonna continue.

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:10.159
We're gonna flounder around, we're gonna falter,

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:14.559
we're gonna be easily derailed and distracted.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.719
The enemy is going to have his way

00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:19.559
because it's gonna be so easy to get us distracted

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:23.439
because we don't know the plan of God.

00:24:23.439 --> 00:24:28.299
But if we know it, if we understand that God has a plan,

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:30.639
and the enemy tries to come and distract us

00:24:30.639 --> 00:24:33.759
and to detour us, we can say, as Jesus said,

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:36.319
get thee behind me, Satan.

00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:37.319
I know where I'm going.

00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:40.599
I know what God's plan is for my life, amen?

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:44.319
And we find here that the task is revealed to us

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:47.559
and we understand that Timothy would be able to continue

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:50.999
with understanding that this was God's plan.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:55.119
Notice as we look here at what it was

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:58.239
that Timothy was to do in Ephesus.

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:01.159
The Bible says that I besought thee to abide still

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.039
at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia.

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.679
So Paul went into Macedonia.

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:08.919
He besought Timothy to stay, to abide,

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:12.999
to continue at Ephesus, and here's what the task was,

00:25:12.999 --> 00:25:17.479
that thou mightest charge some,

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:21.679
that they teach no other doctrine.

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:26.839
The task that is given, the plan for Timothy's life

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:28.319
is that he would charge some.

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:31.439
That word means to command or to order some,

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.519
and what is it specifically that he's commanding

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:38.359
or ordering, that they teach no other doctrine.

00:25:38.359 --> 00:25:39.519
That's very interesting.

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:41.679
We've gotten three verses in the book of 1 Timothy

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.999
and we see the subject of doctrine appear

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:46.199
on the pages of Scripture.

00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:49.239
Today we live in a time in which so many are saying,

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:52.519
in the broad term of Christendom today,

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:55.079
so many are saying, well, doctrine doesn't really matter.

00:25:55.079 --> 00:25:57.799
Doctrine just divides and doctrine isn't really

00:25:57.799 --> 00:26:00.639
that necessary and we can just kind of gravitate

00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:03.479
to the couple of things that would cause us to have unity

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.279
and just kind of focus on those.

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.959
We all love God, don't we?

00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:11.599
And the reality is that doctrine is important.

00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:16.399
In fact, the subject of doctrine in 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:20.719
which is 10 chapters, the reference to the subject

00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:24.879
of doctrine will be given 12 times in 10 chapters.

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:26.039
You think doctrine's important?

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:28.839
Absolutely doctrine's important.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:33.079
We find that here, as we would understand the soundness

00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:36.079
and the purity of doctrine that Paul says,

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.199
the plan that God has for you, Timothy,

00:26:38.199 --> 00:26:41.799
as he's reminding him of why it was that he, Paul,

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:44.879
besought him, Timothy, to abide still at Ephesus

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:46.559
was that he might charge some

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:50.119
that they teach no other doctrine.

00:26:51.239 --> 00:26:55.679
Paul said it this way in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number two,

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:58.359
as he would explain and expound the things

00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:01.439
that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,

00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:04.119
the same commit thou to faithful men

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:06.639
who shall be able to teach others also.

00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:10.399
We find that Paul would say to the believers in Philippi,

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.039
as he would give them instruction

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:14.959
with regard to even teaching truth,

00:27:14.959 --> 00:27:17.359
he says in verse number nine of Philippians 4,

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:20.559
those things which ye have both learned and received

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.319
and heard and seen in me do,

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:25.439
and the God of peace shall be with you.

00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:27.799
Listen, doctrine is important to God,

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:30.379
and here we find that Timothy,

00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:32.639
the plan that God has for Timothy

00:27:32.639 --> 00:27:36.919
is with regard to the soundness and the purity of doctrine,

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:39.519
and he says that you might charge some

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:43.599
that they teach no other doctrine.

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:44.959
Now, it's interesting,

00:27:44.959 --> 00:27:49.279
the other doctrine or doctrines that we could look to

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.479
and see what's given in verse number four,

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:53.719
really in summary type of view,

00:27:53.719 --> 00:27:57.359
notice he'll give further insight and discussion

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:00.879
as we move through these couple of letters

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.879
with regard to some of the false teaching,

00:28:02.879 --> 00:28:04.999
but notice in verse number four, he says this,

00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:09.999
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.

00:28:12.439 --> 00:28:13.479
Then notice what he says,

00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:18.079
which minister questions rather than godly edifying,

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:21.799
which is in faith, so do.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.039
So really in verse number four,

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:25.179
we see these two categories, if you will.

00:28:25.179 --> 00:28:28.119
We see one category of questions

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:31.039
and one category of godly edifying,

00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:35.239
and we find that God reveals in verse number four

00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:40.079
that questions are the result of fables

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:42.019
and endless genealogies.

00:28:42.879 --> 00:28:45.279
That's the result, they're questions,

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.279
but he says that the result,

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:52.279
the product that we're looking for of godly edifying,

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:57.719
the way that you get there is through sound doctrine.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.359
Sound doctrine.

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:02.679
We find that he says, which is in faith,

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:05.439
but notice in verse number two, at the end of the verse,

00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:07.199
it says that if there be any other thing

00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:10.999
that is contrary to sound doctrine,

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:13.199
and we find that throughout God's word

00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:14.759
and throughout 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:16.199
there'll be number of references

00:29:16.199 --> 00:29:19.679
to the importance of doctrine and sound doctrine,

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.959
and sound doctrine lends itself,

00:29:21.959 --> 00:29:24.699
the product will be godly edifying.

00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:29.539
But fables, fictions, and falsehoods,

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:31.459
and endless genealogies,

00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.659
these are things that were very common

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:36.299
amongst Gnostic teaching,

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:40.099
we find that they would lead to questions

00:29:40.099 --> 00:29:42.479
rather than godly edifying.

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:43.739
But understand with me,

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:46.779
as we know what Timothy was to do in Ephesus,

00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:50.939
we know scripturally why Timothy was to do it.

00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:53.219
Turn back to Acts chapter 20, if you will,

00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:56.259
and I want you to see what happens in Acts chapter 20

00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:58.139
that really gives us some insight.

00:29:58.139 --> 00:30:03.019
regard to this plan that God has for the life of Timothy.

00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:08.639
God's plan for Timothy is that he abides still at Ephesus, that he charge some that they

00:30:08.639 --> 00:30:09.859
teach no other doctrine.

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:10.859
Why?

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:14.619
Because there are going to be some that begin to try to incorporate and teach, introduce

00:30:14.619 --> 00:30:17.739
this false teaching, this other doctrine.

00:30:17.739 --> 00:30:23.779
And Paul understands, as God has given his will, that Timothy is to abide there and he

00:30:23.779 --> 00:30:27.779
is to charge some that they teach no other doctrine.

00:30:27.779 --> 00:30:30.779
The soundness and purity of doctrine.

00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:35.139
By the way, as we look here at Acts chapter 20, we're reminded that it's in Acts chapter

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:41.779
number 20 where Paul is speaking, as he's on the way to Jerusalem, to the church leaders

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:45.939
of the church at Ephesus.

00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:47.739
That's who Paul is speaking to.

00:30:47.739 --> 00:30:51.379
Why is it that we look to this passage of Scripture?

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:54.979
Well, because as we look to this passage of Scripture, we find in verse 17, the Bible

00:30:55.779 --> 00:31:04.259
Now, we're not going to look at the entire charge that Paul gives to the elders of the

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:09.859
church at Ephesus, but we find that the connection that God gives us, as we interpret Scripture

00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:14.499
with Scripture, is that Paul is speaking to the church leaders at Ephesus in Acts chapter

00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:20.259
20, but it's in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 3 that God says, through Paul,

00:31:25.939 --> 00:31:31.539
when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine.

00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:32.259
Why is it?

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:34.419
Listen, God is a sovereign God.

00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:36.259
God knows everything.

00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:38.099
He has no beginning and no ending.

00:31:38.099 --> 00:31:43.859
He is Alpha and Omega, and He knows all things, and we find that even as He would know and

00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:49.779
He revealed that there would be false teachers that would creep in, God has the remedy.

00:31:51.459 --> 00:31:52.659
What's the remedy?

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:58.499
I'm going to put you, Timothy, in this place so that you can stand and continue and give

00:31:58.499 --> 00:32:00.659
truth with regard to sound doctrine.

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:05.939
Notice with me in Acts chapter 20 and verse number 29, Paul is finishing up his interaction

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:10.659
with the leaders of the church at Ephesus, and he's concluding this message to them,

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:16.259
and he's speaking to them about the importance of his ministry there and then charging them.

00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:19.299
In fact, he speaks to them about feeding the flock of God.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:20.899
In verse number 28, notice he says,

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:25.619
Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost

00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:30.659
hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:31.139
blood.

00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:32.179
How are they to feed?

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:38.179
Well, Peter speaks in 1 Peter chapter 5 about the elders that were to feed the flock of

00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:42.179
God, were to give the truth and herald the word of God.

00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:47.299
It's speaking about spiritual nourishment, not physical nourishment, and we find that

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:51.139
Paul says feed the church of God, but then notice in verse number 29,

00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:53.059
For I know this.

00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:55.379
This is interesting.

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:56.579
How does Paul know this?

00:32:56.579 --> 00:32:58.099
Well, God revealed it to him.

00:32:59.219 --> 00:33:04.419
And God revealed to him, Paul, what was going to happen in Ephesus, and he says,

00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:12.099
I know this, that after my departing, notice, shall grievous wolves enter in among you,

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:15.299
not sparing the flock.

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:24.419
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:24.979
them.

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:29.619
So God revealed to Paul what was going to happen in Ephesus.

00:33:30.499 --> 00:33:32.819
There are going to be some false teachers that are going to come in.

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:39.299
He refers to them in verse 29 as being grievous wolves, these false teachers.

00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:42.979
These false teachers that would come in, they don't care about the flock.

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.099
They don't care about the sheep.

00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:45.539
They only care about themselves.

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:46.979
They're there for filthy lucre.

00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:51.059
They're there for their own advancement, for their own pride and what have you.

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:54.499
And we find that he says that these grievous wolves, they're going to enter in.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:59.619
But then he says this in verse number 30, that also of your own selves shall men arise,

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:04.419
speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples, notice, after them.

00:34:06.579 --> 00:34:12.179
No, it's not about what was going on in Corinth, that we have little sects of people that I'm

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.779
of Paul and I'm of Apollos and I'm of Cephas.

00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:18.899
No, we're to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:19.459 --> 00:34:26.099
And we find that Paul was given the revelation from God and he gives the warning to the church

00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:27.379
leaders at Ephesus.

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:30.339
What was the answer for the church leaders at Ephesus?

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:35.939
Teach them, feed them, give them truth because I know this is going to happen because God

00:34:35.939 --> 00:34:36.899
has revealed it to us.

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:40.739
But then I want you to see what God does in his perfect plan.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:44.899
In God's omniscient, he's the all-wise God.

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.659
He's got a perfect plan.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:51.059
God, listen, Paul says, I know that after my departing, Paul's going to leave.

00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:51.859
So what does he do?

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:53.619
Timothy's going to stay.

00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:56.019
Timothy's going to stay.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.739
We read it in 1 Timothy chapter 1.

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:00.099
We've looked at it already.

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:06.499
But look at it again with me in verse number 3, as I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus.

00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:10.419
Notice what he says, when I went unto Macedonia.

00:35:11.299 --> 00:35:15.779
So Paul says, I know to the church leaders at Ephesus in Acts chapter number 20 that

00:35:15.779 --> 00:35:17.699
after my departing, this is what's going to happen.

00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:19.379
Why?

00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:20.739
Because God's revealed it to me.

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:24.819
But I also want you to know that not only are you to feed the flock of God, but I'm

00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:26.019
going to leave Timothy there.

00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:31.139
Timothy, I'm beseeching, as I besought thee.

00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:36.259
He's writing this in past tense of what God had placed in the life of Timothy as his

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:36.659
will.

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.499
He says, to abide still at Ephesus.

00:35:38.499 --> 00:35:38.819
Why?

00:35:39.939 --> 00:35:43.139
For thou hast charged some that they teach no other doctrine.

00:35:43.139 --> 00:35:44.899
Listen, God is concerned about doctrine.

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:50.819
And God, in His infinite wisdom, He puts Timothy in this place.

00:35:50.819 --> 00:35:57.059
And we find that God is graciously reminding Timothy through this portion of Scripture

00:35:57.059 --> 00:36:01.219
as Paul is writing to him that God has a plan for your life.

00:36:02.019 --> 00:36:06.819
And as we consider this morning, being equipped to continue, how is it?

00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:08.899
I understand the importance of continuing.

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:10.899
In fact, I want to continue.

00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:12.739
I don't want to be derailed.

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:14.659
I don't want to be detoured.

00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:16.419
I want to finish strong.

00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:19.139
I've got to be equipped.

00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:20.739
I've got to be equipped.

00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:26.259
And I believe that as we look at these four verses of Scripture this morning,

00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:33.299
in 1 Timothy 1, verses 1 through 4, that God reveals these two fundamental truths

00:36:33.939 --> 00:36:40.339
that if we could just grasp this morning and we could embrace these truths this morning,

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:43.939
it would enable each and every one of us to continue.

00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:48.579
You have an enemy that wants to… he wants to devour you.

00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:55.299
But along the way, if he can't devour you, he wants to at least distract you.

00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:57.299
He wants to derail you.

00:36:57.939 --> 00:37:01.539
He wants to prevent you from finishing, from continuing.

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:03.539
He doesn't mind.

00:37:03.539 --> 00:37:08.819
See, Paul says to the churches in Galatia, he said, you did run well.

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:10.019
Who did hinder you?

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:13.139
The enemy wants to hinder us.

00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:17.939
You started out well, but you need to continue.

00:37:17.939 --> 00:37:20.499
It's not how you start the race, it's how you finish the race.

00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:24.419
I would say this morning that we ought to desire to start right and also finish right.

00:37:24.419 --> 00:37:25.859
You say, pastor, I didn't start right.

00:37:25.859 --> 00:37:27.219
Well, then at least finish right.

00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:38.979
This morning, we see in the life of Timothy, he's the one that's being written to personally.

00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:43.619
As we talk about the original recipient of these two letters of 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:49.619
he is the individual, the servant of the Lord, the child of God that's being addressed personally.

00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:55.779
But God providentially preserved two letters that were written under the inspiration of

00:37:55.779 --> 00:38:01.139
the Holy Spirit of God to a servant of the Lord, but he's preserved them for each of us.

00:38:02.019 --> 00:38:04.099
No, I'm not Timothy and neither are you.

00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:06.659
No, I'm not to abide at Ephesus and neither are you.

00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:11.619
But we understand that as we look at the Scripture, as we look at God's Word,

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:14.899
that we can understand and apply truth for us today.

00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:17.379
What is God's plan for your life?

00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:20.259
If you sit there and say, I have no idea.

00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:22.499
In fact, I didn't even know God had a plan for my life.

00:38:23.299 --> 00:38:27.459
The likelihood of you continuing and finishing well is very low.

00:38:29.299 --> 00:38:34.099
But I would say to you this morning that one of the ways that God equips us to continue

00:38:34.099 --> 00:38:36.899
is by revealing to us His plan for our lives.

00:38:37.779 --> 00:38:41.059
It's a precious truth that God has a plan for each and every one of us.

00:38:41.939 --> 00:38:44.819
Now, as we consider the plan of God for our lives this morning,

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:49.939
we'd understand that there are a certain number of elements of God's plan for our

00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:51.939
lives that are consistent for all of us.

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:54.579
It is God's will.

00:38:54.579 --> 00:38:58.419
It is God's plan for your life that, and you begin to list things.

00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:00.179
It's God's will for you to pray.

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:01.619
It's God's will for you to be in church.

00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:03.779
It's God's will for you to give.

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:06.979
It's God's Word for you to testify and tell others about Christ.

00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:09.139
We could speak about the things that are consistent,

00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:13.699
that are general God's will for each and every one of us.

00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:18.419
And we understand God has a plan.

00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:23.619
But then we begin to look at our lives individually and say, God has a plan for me.

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:30.739
God has, God desires to use me in His work.

00:39:31.539 --> 00:39:33.139
That's an amazing thought.

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:38.339
And when we understand that we are His workmen created in Christ Jesus,

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:42.499
and we're to walk and do good works, not to be saved or to stay saved,

00:39:42.499 --> 00:39:46.339
but because we are saved and we understand that God has a plan for us,

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:52.019
God reveals, and I believe thus equips us to be able to continue.

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:52.259
Why?

00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:53.699
Because we know that God has a plan.

00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:58.099
But then we think about that first thought, that first truth, that fundamental truth.

00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:03.339
truth that we began our study with this morning of God's provision. You know, I

00:40:03.339 --> 00:40:10.779
find this morning that often we just can get weary in well-doing because we're

00:40:10.779 --> 00:40:15.939
trying to do it in our own strength. We're trying to do it in our own power. We're

00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:21.219
trying to to do the will of God. We understand that God has a plan and a

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:26.539
will for our lives, but maybe we're just going about it in our own strength.

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:32.779
Maybe we have forgotten the provision of God. We have forgotten that it's God

00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:38.219
who is our Savior. It is God who said that He has given us eternal life and

00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:41.819
will never perish. It's God who has said that that we're kept in His hand, that I

00:40:41.819 --> 00:40:46.779
am His and He is mine. We have forgotten that He is our hope. Listen, there are a

00:40:46.779 --> 00:40:50.939
lot of people today, I remember seeing different things over the years where

00:40:50.939 --> 00:40:55.099
people would speak of something that happens in our nation and whether that's

00:40:55.099 --> 00:40:58.659
a political thing or an economic thing or whatever it is and says, man, we now

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:05.779
have hope. No, our hope is in Jesus. He is my hope. I understand this year is an

00:41:05.779 --> 00:41:10.779
election year. Listen, my hope is not in the election and if that offends you, I'm

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:16.099
sorry. Actually, I'm not sorry, Bart. He tells me not to apologize, but the

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:23.259
reality is you understand that's not my hope. My hope is Jesus. In fact, we sing

00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:30.779
the song, my hope is Jesus, the anchor of my soul. Hallelujah. He gives hope, but He

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:39.019
is my hope. He gives grace. He gives grace. He enables us. He gives mercy and He

00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:46.859
gives peace. Listen, in a world that's lost its mind, if we're going to continue,

00:41:47.859 --> 00:41:53.539
we must understand the provision of God. God has given us all things that pertain

00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:59.219
unto life and godliness. God has equipped us so that we can continue. Listen, if you

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:07.339
do not continue, you cannot charge God for your lack of continuing. It's not God's

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:15.739
fault because God's given us everything that we need to continue. Timothy could not

00:42:15.779 --> 00:42:18.899
resign from the thing that God called him to do and say, well, it's God's fault. No, it's not

00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:24.819
God's fault. It's your fault. I was reading this in my devotions this morning. I wasn't

00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:31.539
going to deal with it, but I want to turn there in Exodus 18. It's a familiar portion

00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:41.659
of Scripture for many of us. In Exodus 18, we find that Jethro, the father-in-law of

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:50.499
Moses, hears all that God did for Moses and for Israel. By the way, that's a lot. I won't

00:42:50.499 --> 00:42:54.419
have time this morning to rehearse and recap what it is that God has done for Israel up

00:42:54.419 --> 00:42:59.699
to this point as we come to Exodus 18, but we find all the plagues in Egypt and the deliverance

00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:05.499
from Egypt and crossing the Red Sea and all that has taken place at this particular point.

00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:11.139
In Exodus 18, we've seen the fact that there's bitter water at Marah. We find the provision

00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:18.059
of manna in chapter 16. We find in chapter 17 the fact that there's no water at Meribah,

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:23.219
and we find that as we look at these things and we understand that God has done some amazing

00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:30.579
things, and Jethro hears about it. There's some rejoicing that takes place. In fact,

00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:35.379
the Bible starts in verse number 9 and says, and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:40.779
the Lord had done to Israel. There was rejoicing going on, but then in the same text of Scripture,

00:43:40.779 --> 00:43:46.899
Jethro observes some things that are taking place with regard to Moses. The Bible says

00:43:46.899 --> 00:43:50.659
in verse 13, and it came to pass in the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people, and the

00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:55.979
people stood by Moses. Notice what it says, from the morning unto the evening. And when

00:43:55.979 --> 00:44:00.899
Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, what is this thing that

00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:06.019
thou doest to the people? Wise didst thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by

00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:10.099
thee from morning unto evening. And Moses said to his father-in-law, because the people

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:13.979
come unto me to inquire of God, when they have a matter, they come unto me, and I judge

00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:19.659
between one another, and I do make them know the statutes of God and His laws. Moses' father-in-law

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:25.499
said unto him, the thing that thou doest is not good. Notice what it says, thou wilt surely,

00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:34.659
what's it say in your Bible, wear away, both thou and this people that is with thee. For

00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:41.699
this thing, notice, is too heavy for thee. Thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:46.019
Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee. Be thou

00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:50.779
for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God. Thou shalt teach

00:44:50.779 --> 00:44:55.579
them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work

00:44:55.579 --> 00:45:00.899
that they must do. Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear

00:45:01.219 --> 00:45:04.659
of God, men of truth, hating covetousness, and place such over them, to be rulers of

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:10.699
thousands and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties and rulers of tens. And let them judge

00:45:10.699 --> 00:45:14.619
the people at all seasons, and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:19.459
thee, but every small matter they shall judge, so shall it be easier for thyself, and they

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:23.499
shall bear the burden with thee. I meditated on this thought this morning from verse number

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:31.259
22. Easier isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes we think that life has to be really hard,

00:45:31.259 --> 00:45:37.259
we've got to make it really hard to be godly. But here's what Jethro says, I believe it's

00:45:37.259 --> 00:45:42.379
counsel from God by the way, he said it might be easier for thee. Not in the sense that

00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:47.699
we're just looking for easy street and we don't want to do anything, but he says, remember,

00:45:47.699 --> 00:45:52.019
thou shalt wear away. So I'm going to make it easier for you, then notice what it says

00:45:52.019 --> 00:45:56.019
in verse 23, if thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so, then shalt thou

00:45:56.019 --> 00:46:02.419
be able to, what does your Bible say? Endure. So I want you to draw the line, the connection

00:46:02.419 --> 00:46:07.459
between verse number 18 when the Bible says thou will surely wear away, and in verse 23

00:46:07.459 --> 00:46:15.459
when it says thou shalt be able to endure. What did God do? God gave some provision to

00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:20.259
Moses. It's different provision that we look at in 1st Timothy 1, but we find that God

00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:28.899
was providing Moses with that which he needed so that he could do, continue what he was

00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:34.139
supposed to do. Listen, for each of us this morning, when we understand that God has a

00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:37.899
plan for us, again, my plan and your plan are not the same exact, there's many things

00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:44.059
that are consistent amongst it, but there are differences. I'm not going to, my plan

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:50.219
is not Moses' plan. My plan is not Timothy's plan. But we find this morning that God has

00:46:50.219 --> 00:46:57.299
provided us with everything that we need so that we do not wear away, but so that we

00:46:57.299 --> 00:47:05.259
endure, so that we continue. This morning, as we look at these introductory few verses

00:47:05.259 --> 00:47:13.779
to 1st Timothy 1, we find that God gives us two fundamental truths that when understood

00:47:13.779 --> 00:47:20.939
truly provide us with what we need so that we can understand that we have been equipped

00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:27.979
to continue. It's His provision and it's His plan. And when we understand those things

00:47:27.979 --> 00:47:34.499
by God's grace and with God's help because He provides it all for us, we will endure,

00:47:34.499 --> 00:47:39.859
we will continue. It's one thing to understand the importance, the charge, the exhortation.

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:47.459
It's one thing to even accept the call. But if we try to do it in our own strength, if

00:47:47.459 --> 00:47:54.499
we do it haphazardly without any real confidence, man, we're going to be easy prey for the enemy.

00:47:54.499 --> 00:48:00.259
And so God says, understand that I have provided and understand that I have a plan for your

00:48:00.259 --> 00:48:06.219
life. And when you understand those things, you are equipped to continue. Let's pray.

00:48:06.219 --> 00:48:11.059
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word, the truth

00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:19.419
that's contained therein. God, I pray that You would help us this morning to understand

00:48:19.419 --> 00:48:25.659
these fundamental truths contained within these few verses of Scripture. If we're going

00:48:25.659 --> 00:48:36.139
to continue, we must recognize Your provision and Your plan for our lives. God, I pray this

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:43.179
morning that the Holy Spirit would take the Word of God, minister to each individual that's

00:48:43.179 --> 00:48:49.259
here. Lord, maybe there's one that's not even sure of heaven. We sang about heaven. We spoke

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:54.859
about God being our Savior. Quite honestly, they do not know for sure that heaven is their

00:48:54.859 --> 00:49:00.299
home. Lord, I pray that today they would understand that Your plan for their life, according to

00:49:00.299 --> 00:49:06.419
1 Timothy 2, is that they would be saved. I pray that they would allow us to take a

00:49:06.419 --> 00:49:13.659
Bible and show them, and they would bow their heart, Lord, to You, trust You as their personal

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:19.659
Lord and Savior. Lord, I think of the many saved people that are here this morning, Your

00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:26.019
people. Lord, we face an enemy. We face great difficulty and opposition. But God, You've

00:49:26.019 --> 00:49:32.779
equipped us to continue. You've given us all that we need. Your provision is abundant.

00:49:32.779 --> 00:49:38.339
You're our Savior, our hope. You give grace, mercy, and peace. God, You have a plan for

00:49:38.339 --> 00:49:45.779
us. And God, I pray that as we understand those two fundamental truths, that we would

00:49:45.779 --> 00:49:50.979
be equipped to continue. Lord, I pray that if we've been trying in our own strength,

00:49:50.979 --> 00:49:58.099
in our own power, Lord, that we'd just repent of that. We confess it as being sin and pride.

00:49:58.099 --> 00:50:06.139
Lord, that we just trust You for Your enablement.

00:50:06.139 --> 00:50:09.739
I pray that in these few moments of invitation, Lord, that You would have Your perfect will

00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:13.859
and way in each and every individual that's present here this morning.

00:50:13.859 --> 00:50:22.259
Lord, help us as we've been recipients of Your Word, now Lord, help us to respond and

00:50:22.259 --> 00:50:24.379
to be doers of Your Word.

00:50:24.379 --> 00:50:27.219
We'll thank You for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:50:27.219 --> 00:50:28.619
Would you stand with me?

00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:29.859
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
