00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
With the Lord's help today we'll go from verse 18 through 27. You want to open the windows?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.239
I mean you can if you want that's fine

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.359
distractions

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.719
First John chapter number 2 verses 18 through 27. We'll be looking at this morning

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:19.760
I just want to read verse number 18 and we'll get into the message this morning

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.579
It says little children is the last time and as you have heard that

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.840
Antichrist shall come

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
Even now are there many?

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.680
Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time we're living in the last days

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.880
we understand that Paul as he's writing to Timothy in 2nd Timothy, he speaks about some of the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.560
the truth with regard to the last days and some of the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.279
Ways in which we will be dealing with various things

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:53.759
He talks about the perilous times that shall come and we find that here as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:00:53.759 --> 00:01:01.119
Really as John is ministering to these believers. He's giving them great truth. That is so precious for us this morning as well

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.959
It's been so impactful throughout the entirety of the church age if you'll remember in our previous study

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:07.919
It was two weeks ago

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.059
But in our previous study we looked at verses 15 through 17

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:14.839
Love not the world and as we looked at that passage of Scripture

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:19.699
We spoke about the fact that there was a warning that was given to the believers

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.580
With regard to the tactic of the enemy to corrupt the people of God and the Church of God

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.860
externally and we see the external threat the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.139
warning was given about those three pitfalls the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and the way in

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:44.620
Which the enemy will use the external things in order to corrupt the people of God and to corrupt the Church of God

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.339
This morning as we move into this passage of Scripture in verses 18 through 27

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.180
Really?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.220
Now we are given a warning with regard to the tactic of the enemy to corrupt the people of God and the Church of God

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.139
internally and we see that there's an

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:08.059
external factor the world the flesh the devil the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life we see

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:13.860
That external threat and the warning that is given but we find that as we enter into this section in first

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.619
John that once again, there is a reference to the internal threat that of false teaching and we understand that the enemy

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.339
as Jude mentions that there have been some that have crept in unawares and

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:35.020
the importance of contending earnestly contending for the faith because of this internal

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:41.059
Threat to the people of God to the Church of God and the enemy using that internal

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.179
Tactic in order to corrupt the people of God now, we know that throughout the New Testament

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:50.979
in fact, we started as we began the study in the book of first John to speak about some of the

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:57.699
false teaching that was prevalent at the particular time and some of what they were dealing with and we know that all throughout the first

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.699
century and all throughout church history

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.539
And including today there has been false teaching we find the New Testament gives us many references and many

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.660
Truths with regard to the subject of false teaching and to the warnings

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:18.300
We find that Peter says it this way under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God that just as there were false

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:23.940
Prophets that there will be false teachers as you study the Word of God in the Old Testament

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.300
You'll find that on a number of occasion. There is record in reference to the false prophets that were so prevalent

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.740
During that day when God was using Jeremiah in particular

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.580
God was giving Jeremiah truth and God was giving Jeremiah warning with regard to the impending danger

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.460
The the Babylonian captivity and all that was taking place and yet there were false

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.020
Prophets that were coming on the stage and saying nope. This isn't true. This isn't true

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.460
This isn't gonna happen and so on and so forth

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.740
And if you read the book of Jeremiah and you understand what's taking place throughout that those portions of that book

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.380
you'll find that God is faithful to say I have given my word to Jeremiah and

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.300
These are liars. They're false prophets. They're not

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.179
prophesying my word they're coming and they're saying that they're speaking the word of the Lord, but in fact

00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:21.260
They are lying and we find here that these false teachers

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.500
Continue to exist today and there is a great danger of corruption

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:35.220
Internally notice as we study this portion of Scripture this morning if you're taking notes number one the exposure of false teaching

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.739
I'm thankful that the Word of God exposes the false teachers for what they are

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.500
Amen, I'm thankful that God has provided us with this precious book and with the truth. He says thy word is truth

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.540
I'm thankful that Jesus himself is truth and he's given us truth and it exposes the false teaching

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.480
We notice here as we look at verses 18 and 19. I've read verse 18. Let me read verse 19

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.179
It says they went out from us speaking of these that are referred to in verse number 18 as Antichrist

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:08.859
They went out from us, but they were not of us for if they had been of us

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.720
They would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:20.899
Manifest that they were not all of us as we consider the exposure of false teaching

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:27.339
I want you to see the description that is provided the description of these false teachers in verse number 18

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.359
The Bible refers to describes these false teachers as being Antichrist

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.760
Notice the Bible says in verse number 18 as you have heard it says little children

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.059
It is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.040
We'll come back to that at the end of the message this morning

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.899
But notice the next phrase even now are there many?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.380
Antichrists

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.859
Whereby we know that it is the last time we find that this word

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.339
Antichrist or Antichrist. It's the same Greek word

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.739
We find that John uses it in his writings and we find that really the the best way to define this word is any

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:12.260
person that is teaching something that is against Christ or

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.980
Instead of Christ and we find that this spirit of the Antichrist and these many

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:24.980
Antichrists that are already prevalent. We're told in 2nd Thessalonians chapter number 3 and verse number 7

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:30.619
Excuse me chapter number 2 and verse number 7 that the mystery of iniquity doth already work

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:34.299
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:39.739
And we see how that these false teachers are described that they're described as being Antichrist

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.660
They are against the Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.700
The Bible tells us in 1st John chapter number 4 in verse number 3 in every spirit that confesseth

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.500
Not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:59.660
Whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.380
Already is it in the world?

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.700
We find that in verse number 1 of 1st John chapter number 4

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.739
He refers to these as being not only Antichrist, but as false prophets

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:14.299
Notice it says in 1st John 4 in verse number 1

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:21.940
It says this beloved believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because why because many

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:26.019
False prophets are gone out into the world

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.059
the plurality the the number of these false prophets of these

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.380
Antichrist these that are against the Lord Jesus Christ notice the description goes further in our text

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.540
It says in 1st John 2 in verse number 22

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.059
It says who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:51.140
He is Antichrist that denieth the father and the son he calls him a liar

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.940
They're liars

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.859
The Bible tells us that the devil is a liar. He's the father of it

00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:04.420
He's the father of it. Amen and John chapter number 8 and we find that Jesus is truth

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:05.859
but these

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:12.420
Antichrist these false teachers that are prevalent not only in the day in which John is writing all throughout church history and

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:18.179
especially today we see these many false teachers these false prophets these

00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:22.359
Antichrists as they're described for us. And so we see the description

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:27.820
I want you to notice their doctrine the doctrine of these false teachers in verse 22 in verse 23

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.219
We read verse 22. It says who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.859
He is Antichrist that denieth the father and the son notice verse 23

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
whosoever denieth the son

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:47.780
The same hath not the father, but he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.419
in 1st John 2 in verse 22 and 23

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.340
God gives us some insight with regard to the doctrine of these false teachers

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.380
That are described as being liars and being antichrists. We find that there's something that's very consistent

00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:09.659
Amongst cults and amongst world religions and that is their false teaching surrounding the person of Jesus Christ

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.059
We find that this is so prevalent in our society today

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:17.140
you begin to look at the cults and the world religions and you find that they're

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:21.659
They they air with regard to the person of Jesus Christ

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:28.859
And let me say this if you're wrong on who Jesus is you're wrong. I mean and it is the the the the

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:35.260
Cost of being wrong on that point is severe because we know that without the Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:40.219
That there is no salvation. The Bible says that I am the way the truth and the life

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:42.419
No, man cometh unto the father

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.580
But by me there is no other name given under given among men under heaven given among men

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:55.659
Whereby we must be saved Peter is speaking in Acts 4 about the name of Jesus and we find here that here these

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.780
Antichrists these false teachers these liars

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.360
What is it that they do? What is their doctrine? Notice it says that they

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:12.140
denieth, in verse number 22, that Jesus is the Christ. They deny that He is God in

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:18.160
flesh. They deny the deity of Jesus Christ. They deny it. There are many today

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.880
that have tried to explain away the Trinity. They've tried to attack the

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.640
person of Jesus Christ. Why? Because perhaps they say, well, it doesn't make

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.840
sense in my mind. His ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.780
He transcends us, and we cannot fully comprehend who He is. The reality is that

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.820
the Bible tells us, even as I said this morning as we opened in prayer, that our

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.200
God is a great God. We sang, to God be the glory, great things He hath done. And our

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.900
God is great, and His greatness has been revealed to us. His greatness has been

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.320
declared to us. But as much as we know this morning that He is great, the

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.040
psalmist continues to say that His greatness is unsearchable. It's amazing.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.400
When you think about how great our God is, and as much as I think I might

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.320
understand, as much as you think you might understand, He's so much higher

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:18.680
than what we could possibly conceive in our minds. He is God. He is God in flesh.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:25.200
He has no beginning and no end. He is the Almighty. He is the Messiah. He is the

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.400
Promised One. And we find that they deny that Jesus is the Christ, and look at

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.320
the consequence of their false teaching. It says in verse number 23,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.720
Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. There's no wiggle room.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.840
Amen? There's no wiggle room. There's an absolute truth that is

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.880
provided to us here in this passage of Scripture. Listen, you can't deny the

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.160
person of Christ. You can't deny the truth of the deity of Christ and have

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.960
the Father, because the only way you know the Father is through the Son. Amen?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.000
Now remember, the writer, humanly speaking, of the book of 1 John is the

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.160
Apostle John. You think about the truth of the book of the Gospel of John and

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.720
how the Gospel of John shows over and over and proves the deity of Jesus

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.000
Christ. And John, remember, he's saying, I'm an eyewitness. Remember as we started

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.160
this book, we talked about how he says we've heard Him, we've seen Him, we've

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.920
handled Him. He's providing this truth, and he says, listen, there are many false

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.880
teachers. They are anti-Christ. They're against the Lord Jesus Christ. They deny

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:40.480
that He is God, and in their denial of Him being God, they do not have the

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.400
Father. 2 John 1, there's only one chapter, but 2 John and verse number 7,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.800
the Bible says this. Notice just a few pages over in 2 John, verse number 7,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.480
for many deceivers are entered into the world. Do you see how every one of these

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.880
references talks about the plurality of them and the number of them? There are

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.360
many, and it says this, who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:13.280
This is a deceiver and an anti-Christ. Jesus did come in the flesh. He was born

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.600
of a virgin. He was born. Remember, you think about the truth of Philippians

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.280
chapter number 2, where the Bible talks about, let this mind be in you, which was

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.980
also in Christ Jesus, and you begin to read the truth of Philippians 2, and you

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.080
read about the incarnation, and you read about all that takes place, and what a

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.040
blessing to see the summary that is given. It continues and says, who being in

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.200
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.000
no reputation, took upon the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.280
men. The Bible tells us that being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.720
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. But you understand

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.360
that he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave. Amen! He rose. He lives. He ever

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.960
liveth to make intercession for us. He's coming again, and here we find that the

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.840
Bible says, wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.440
which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.040
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.800
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.560
These false teachers, these antichrists that deny that Jesus is Lord, I'm sorry

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.240
this morning for them, but the reality is that one day they will acknowledge that

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.720
He is God. I hope they would acknowledge it before it's eternally too late. It's

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.240
not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And when makes all the difference, because

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.280
they will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. We find that here in the book of 1 John we

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.600
see the description of false teachers, because these false teachers are being exposed, and

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.440
the Word of God is exposing them for what they are, and they're described, and then

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.680
we see their doctrine, and I want you to see their desire. What's the desire of these

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.280
false teachers? Well, in verse number 26 of 1 John chapter number 2, we find that this

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.040
desire that is given to us is revealed to us here. It says, these things have I written

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.360
unto you, the believers, the little children that are addressed in verse number 18, concerning

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:36.560
them, that's the false teachers, that's the antichrist, that seduce you. Their desire

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.680
is to seduce you. That word means to cause to stray, to lead away, to lead aside from

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.760
the right way. That's what they want to do, they want to seduce you. And let me say this,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.380
just like they did in the book of Jeremiah, these false teachers, these false prophets,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:00.120
they come with all of their fanfare, they come with all of their just various types

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.040
of eloquence, and they come in, and sometimes they'll use various means, and man, they look

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.640
like they got it all together and they sound good and so on and so forth, but they're lying.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.640
They're false teachers. Let me give you one example in Jeremiah chapter 28. The Bible

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.640
records for us here about Hananiah the prophet that died because God said he was going to

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.920
die because he was a false prophet and he was prophesying lies. But it's interesting

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.700
as you look through Jeremiah chapter 28, it's only 17 verses, I don't have the time to read

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.940
all of it, but I want you to know that as we go through this passage of Scripture that

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.660
Hananiah, in verse number 10, let me read verse number 9, the prophet which prophesieth

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.420
of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.100
that the Lord hath truly sent him. That's the test. You can read that all the way back

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.080
in Deuteronomy, but then look in verse number 10, then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.120
from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and break it. Can you imagine the way in which the crowd

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.320
would respond to such antics? Jeremiah is prophesying that the Babylonians that besiege

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.840
us, that they're going to take us captive and that this city is going to be destroyed

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.960
and so on and so forth, and then this Hananiah comes and he takes these yokes and he breaks

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:27.440
them and he says in the presence of all the people, notice in verse number 11, thus saith

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.520
the Lord, they proclaim, they pretend that they're speaking the word of God. It says,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.280
even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the neck of all nations

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.760
within the space of two full years, and the prophet Jeremiah went his way. Then the word

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.120
of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.160
the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, go and tell Hananiah, saying,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.880
thus saith the Lord, thou hast broken the yokes of wood, but thou shalt make for them

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.400
yokes of iron. It's interesting, he said that it would be within the space of two

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.040
full years, but if you read verse number 16, it says, therefore, thus saith the Lord, behold,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.600
I will cast thee from off the face of the earth. This year thou shalt die, because thou

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.120
hast taught rebellion against the Lord. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.960
the seventh month. God dealt with him. It was severe judgment. But I just think about

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.800
that passage of Scripture and the antics of Hananiah and the way in which he's breaking

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.360
that yoke. I mean, certainly the people would be excited about hearing something like that.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.240
He's saying that he's speaking the word of the Lord, but God says, no, I didn't give

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:44.240
him this message. We see that the desire of these antichrists, the desire of these false

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.880
teachers is to seduce, to deceive. Remember this truth in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.880
13, the Bible says, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:03.440
deceived. On Wednesday evenings, several, I don't know, last year in the fall, I preached

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.080
a series for a couple of months on the danger of deception. The way in which we read all

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.240
throughout the word of God, the warning has been given to us with regard to this age of

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:19.720
deception in which we're living. We find that these false teachers that are mentioned here,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.480
the exposure of false teaching, he gives a description, he gives their doctrine and

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.520
then he speaks of their desire. As we move forward this morning, I want you to think

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.760
not only of the exposure of false teaching, but I want you to consider number two, the

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.960
enabling of the believer, the enabling of the believer. I'm thankful that there's a

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.640
great contrast in these verses of Scripture with regard to the behavior of the false teacher,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.320
the behavior of the Antichrist, that spirit of Antichrist versus the behavior of the believer.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.560
The reality is that in verse number 20, the Bible says, but we, excuse me, but ye have

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.840
an unction from the Holy One, and ye know it.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.480
all things." Notice, in verse number 27, it says,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.000
"...but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you. And ye

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.880
need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you of all

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.880
things, and is truth, and is no lie. And even as it hath taught you, ye shall

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.080
abide in him." We have an unction from the Holy One. The anointing which we have

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.400
received, according to verse number 27, "...of him abideth in you." And we find that

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.760
this is none other than the anointing of the Holy Spirit of God. I'm so thankful

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.960
for the Holy Spirit. I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us that at the moment

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.720
of salvation that we are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.260
earnest of our inheritance. The Bible teaches us that in Ephesians 1 and

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.080
verses 13 and 14. And what a joy to know that my body is the temple of the Holy

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.720
Spirit of God, and if you've been saved, if you've been born again, the Holy Spirit

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.520
of God indwells you. We have this unction. We have this anointing, and he's

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.560
speaking of that. We understand that later in the book of Ephesians that the

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.400
believers in Ephesus would be encouraged to be filled with the Spirit of God. You

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.820
receive the Spirit of God at the moment of salvation. You've been indwelled by

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.640
the Spirit of God, but you must be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. What's the

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.200
difference? What is it that we're speaking of? Well, very simply this, it's

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.080
not how much of the Holy Spirit I have, because at the moment of salvation, I got

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:42.600
all of the Holy Spirit I'm ever gonna get, and so did you. What's in view here

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.400
is how much of me the Holy Spirit has. How much have I yielded to the Holy

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.640
Spirit of God? How much have I been filled with the Holy Spirit? What

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:59.800
prevents me from being filled with the Holy Spirit of God itself? We find that

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.040
we've been given this responsibility, and we think about the enabling of the

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.760
believer. I want you to think about this passage and what this enabling allows

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:16.760
us to do. It enables us to perceive. To perceive. Notice with me in verse 21, again,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:23.160
we'd say this, to perceive or to discern, and discernment is critical. Discernment

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.320
is critical. Why? Because they'll wax eloquent. They'll use words that seem to

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.160
be close to what you're familiar with. They'll say things that seem to, man, they

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.680
got it all together. They've presented this so just in order, and it just seems

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.960
so just right like it should be, right in line. They'll wax eloquent, but we need

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.360
perception. We need to be able to perceive. We need to be able to discern.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.680
Notice in 1 John 2, it says that we have an unction from the Holy One in

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.360
verse number 20, and ye know all things. Continue in verse number 21. Notice what

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.000
it says here. It says this, I have not written unto you because you know not

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.480
the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. You see how

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.300
John is encouraging these believers. It's interesting because Peter says this, I'm

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.300
gonna remind you of some things. I'm gonna stir you up by putting you in

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.060
remembrance of things. Though you know them, he says I'm gonna remind you of

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.660
them, and John says I'm not writing to you because you don't know the truth, but

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.980
in fact you know it. You have the truth, and I'm trying to help you to

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.260
understand that no lie is of the truth, and so as this enabling that we have, it

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.940
enables us to perceive the anointing of the Holy Spirit of God, helps us to

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.340
be able to perceive and to discern between right and wrong, between right

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.260
teaching and wrong teaching, between truth and error. We find that as we look

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.540
at this passage of Scripture, and he speaks about that, that we know the truth,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.660
that we have the truth. Again in verse number 27, he tells us that he teaches us

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.700
the truth. I am so thankful this morning that the Holy Spirit of God is the

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.340
divine teacher. I'm thankful this morning that the Holy Spirit of God, according to

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:18.780
what John writes to us, and you read in chapters 15 and 16 as the Lord Jesus

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:25.180
Christ is giving this truth to the disciples with regard to the coming of

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.780
the Holy Spirit of God, he says it's expedient for you that I go away. He is

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:36.820
the the Holy Spirit of comfort, but he's also our divine teacher, and it tells us

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:42.580
in verse number 27 that you need not that any man teach you, but as the same

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:50.460
anointing teacheth you of all things, notice this, and is truth and is no lie,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:59.340
and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. I'm thankful for the

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.460
enabling of the Holy Spirit of God, the enabling of the believer, and that he

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:09.940
enables us to perceive. You hear something, and maybe you don't know the

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.460
exact answer. Maybe you're not equipped to have that perfect answer immediately,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.540
but the Holy Spirit of God just gives you that uneasy feeling with regard to

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:25.020
something just doesn't seem right with that. You begin to dig in, and you begin

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.500
to ask the divine teacher to reveal to you from this precious book the

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.420
truth of God's Word, what it is that is truth on that particular subject. Listen,

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.780
we're not to be tossed to and fro with all of these teachings, and we're to be

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.060
settled and established, and we're to know the truth, and I'm thankful that the

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:50.620
Holy Spirit of God enables us to perceive. Discernment is critical when

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:56.860
you think about false teaching. They wax eloquent. Notice not only the enabling

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.540
that he enables us to perceive, but I want you to understand he enables us to

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:06.660
proceed, to continue. Notice in verse number 24, he says this,

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.060
let that therefore abide in you. He uses that phrase at the end of verse number

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.500
27 as well, ye shall abide in him, and that phrase abide. Of course, John would

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.820
be very familiar with that phrase as he was taught about the importance of

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.060
abiding in Christ. He says, let that therefore abide in you. What is it that

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.220
he is referring to? What you have heard from the beginning. What you have heard

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.420
from the beginning. There's nothing new under the sun, right? God's given us all

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.500
things that pertain unto life and godliness, and we find that John's saying,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.740
listen, just as Paul said when he's writing to those churches in the region

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.300
of Galatia, he's saying, listen, there's no new gospel. There's no other gospel.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:52.220
These people have come in and they've given you a false gospel, and John says,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.580
listen, let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.580
beginning. Notice, if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:07.420
you, notice, ye shall, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:14.180
I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit of God, the anointing, that unction that enables

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.260
us to proceed, to continue. Yes, we understand that we're living in the

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.100
midst of apostasy. We're living in the last days. We're living with so many

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.820
false teachers, but the enabling, the unction, the anointing of the Holy

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:36.420
Spirit of God enables us to proceed, to continue going forward. We don't have to

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.420
become a casualty by this internal attack. Remember, as we said by way of

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.300
introduction, that as you notice in the previous text of Scripture that we

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.980
looked at two weeks ago, that there's the warning that is given with regard to

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:55.060
that attack, that corruption externally. The world, the lust of the flesh, the lust

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.500
of the eyes, the pride of life. And you say, listen, love not the world. There's

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.500
the potential of becoming corrupt because of the world, the external threat.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:10.220
And how sad it is that so many churches today have become so worldly that it's

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:15.460
almost impossible to distinguish them between being a church and being a club.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:21.900
And that's sad. I know it's not popular, but it is certainly prevalent in our

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:29.500
society today. Come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord. There

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.940
is a distinction and a difference amongst the people of God. Amen? By the

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.620
grace of God and with the help of God, we're never gonna have a nightclub

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:45.820
atmosphere in this place. Amen? Seriously. Don't get me on that rabbit trail. Let me

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:53.540
get back. Amen? I'm serious though. There should be a distinction, the external

00:28:53.540 --> 00:29:00.420
threat. But you know there's an internal threat and it's false teaching. And they

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:08.900
creep in unawares. They begin to preach heresy. They deny the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.059
Though I've said this, we need to be careful of false teachers because they

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:17.620
use our vocabulary but not our dictionary. They'll use words that you're

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.340
familiar with but they mean something entirely different by those words. And we

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.580
have to be careful to have that discernment to say, listen, we need to be

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.180
able to understand what is being said and what is being given. And what do you

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:39.059
mean by that? What is your definition of that? The Holy Spirit of God enables us

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:42.780
to continue. It's interesting, we won't take time this morning, but if you go

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.220
back to 2 Timothy chapter number 3 and you read about those perilous times and

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.740
how Paul describes all that will take place and he says, as we mentioned in

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.980
verse number 13 of chapter number 3, that evil men and seducers shall wax worse

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:01.460
and worse, deceiving and being deceived. You know what verse number 14 says?

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.220
but continue."

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.380
Yeah, there are going to be false teachers, there's going to be all of this nonsense that's

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.380
going on, but we're to continue.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.020
How can I continue?

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.760
First John chapter number 2.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.420
It's the enabling, the anointing, that truth abiding in us and that if it remains in us

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.540
that ye shall continue in the Son and in the Father.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.920
The Word of God is precious and it's so connected.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.960
One passage to another and you interpret Scripture by Scripture and you begin to see,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.880
listen, I can't continue in my own power and neither can you.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.360
With all of the apostasy and all of the trouble that's going on in the perilous times, I'm

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.920
not able to continue in my own power and neither are you.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.320
But we have that enabling, the anointing, the unction.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.600
What a blessing.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.600
Now let me, as we look at this passage of Scripture and we identify the exposure of

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.840
false teaching and the enabling of the believer, let me circle back.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.000
I said that we'd go back to this in verse number 18 and I'm going to spend the remainder

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.200
of the time this morning with regard to this thought.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.280
As you look back at verse number 18, John started in verse number 18 by making this

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.000
statement, little children, it is the last time.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.120
And as ye have heard, that Antichrist shall come.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.040
Even now are there many Antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.400
See, the reality is that as he refers to these false teachers as being Antichrists, he also

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.280
makes mention that they have heard that Antichrist shall come.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.080
And he is going to come.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.260
The Antichrist will be revealed.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.720
We don't know exactly a date.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.480
I do not intend in any way, shape, or form this morning, as we look at a few things,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.620
to try to put any type of date on this because it would be inappropriate for me to do so,

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:05.160
but the reality is that we can understand biblically and scripturally when it is that

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.760
the Antichrist shall rise.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.960
It's very likely that the Antichrist is in our society today.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.640
We'd have no idea who they might be, but when they rise, I would say this, it would be after

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.200
the rapture of the church.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.400
The rapture of the church is imminent, by the way, and really, if we had a couple of

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.680
hours this morning, we'd just go all the way through the third verse of chapter number

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.560
three because they're so connected with verse 18 of chapter number two of 1 John, all the

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.680
way through verse three of chapter number three.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.680
We'll break it up into two messages, and I'll deal with that subject next week, of when

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.540
he shall appear, but Jesus is coming.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.600
His return is imminent.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.120
And the reality is that the Bible would teach us that after the rapture of the church, again,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.400
which is imminent, that the Antichrist shall rise.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.120
According to Daniel chapter number nine in verse number 27, he, the Antichrist, is going

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:04.000
to sign a peace treaty with Israel at the start of the tribulation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.400
That is going to happen.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.440
And we find, according to Daniel nine in verse number 27, that it's at the start of that

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:16.200
seven period, that period of tribulation, the week of tribulation that is referred to,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:23.880
and we find that at the midpoint, at the three-and-a-half-year point, he is going to break that treaty, right?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.200
In 2 Thessalonians chapter number two, I mentioned already, verse number seven, where the Bible

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:34.040
says that the mystery of iniquity doth already work, but notice in 2 Timothy two, in verse

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.760
number three, and excuse me, I said Timothy, 2 Thessalonians, excuse me, 2 Thessalonians

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.200
two, in verse number three, we're talking about when will Antichrist rise.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.920
John started out the passage of scripture in 1 John two, in verse number 18, speaking

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.060
to these believers and telling them, and this is the last time, and telling them that they

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.580
have heard that Antichrist shall come.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.600
He then continues and says, listen, there are already many Antichrists, these false

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.960
teachers that are prevalent, but the reality is that the Antichrist is going to appear.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.960
He is going to rise.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.000
Continuing to 2 Thessalonians two, in verse number three, the Bible says, let no man deceive

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.120
you by any means, for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.580
that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.060
This is the Antichrist, how he's described here in 2 Thessalonians.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.940
We notice that in verse number four, again, the connection of Daniel's prophecy in chapter

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.620
number nine, and it talks about at that midpoint of the tribulation, in verse number four of

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.820
2 Thessalonians two, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:49.440
is worshiped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.260
is God.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.860
We know that he's not God, he's Antichrist.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.580
But when does this rise of Antichrist, how is it that we would say that it's after the

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.580
rapture of the church?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.140
Well, we'll turn to the book of Revelation, thank you for asking, and look in the book

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.660
of Revelation in chapter number three, and then we'll look at chapter four and chapter

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.420
six.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:16.540
In Revelation chapter number three, as the messages are given to the churches in Asia,

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:21.220
they begin in chapter number two, and in chapter number three, he's given a message to Philadelphia,

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.100
the church in Philadelphia, in verses seven through 13.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.340
I want to notice what he says in verse number 10, because thou hast kept the word of my

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:34.020
patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.340
all the world, to try them and to dwell upon the earth.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.620
We know that Jeremiah speaks of the tribulation as being the day of Jacob's trouble, and we

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.060
find that in Revelation chapter number four, as you look at all of the churches that are

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.600
addressed in chapters two and three, really providing us truth with regard to the church

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.740
age.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.180
And we find that in the fourth chapter, beginning in verse number one, notice what the Bible

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.940
says, after this, after all that he deals with with these seven churches, after this,

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:13.740
I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:19.860
was as it were of a trumpet talking with me.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.820
The songwriter said, listen for the trumpet, Jesus is coming.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.820
Why do you say that?

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.540
We find that in Thessalonians chapter number four, and you think about the trump of God,

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:35.460
and here we find that here's what it said, come up hither, and I will show thee things

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.900
which must be hereafter.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.660
We find that as you look at the scriptures, I believe that this is the record, the truth

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.660
with regard to the rapture of the church.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.860
Skip over to chapter number six, if you will, and we see some things in chapters four and

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.140
five, but in chapter number six, we begin to see about the seal judgments.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.900
And I just want to focus for just a few minutes this morning on the first of these three seal

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:06.540
judgments that are mentioned in Revelation chapter number six, because this is the rise

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.500
of Antichrist, the first seal in particular.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.300
Notice in Revelation six, in verses one and two, the Bible says this is the first of these

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.300
seven seals.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.980
It says, and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.140
Now, who's the lamb?

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.420
That's Jesus, right?

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.580
That is the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:33.940
So the lamb opens one of the seals, and I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder, one

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.920
of the four beasts saying, come and see.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.600
And I saw, and behold, a white horse.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.180
And he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.420
and to conquer.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.460
Let me say this, this is none other than the counterfeit, the Antichrist.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.580
This is not the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:01.980
We find that he will come in Revelation chapter 19, and we read of that passage of Scripture,

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.580
and the heaven is open in verse number 11 of Revelation 19.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.340
I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.980
and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.500
That's the return of Jesus Christ at the end of the tribulation.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:25.020
This record of this first seal in Revelation 6, verses 1 and 2, this white horse, this

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:33.900
is the counterfeit, this is the rise of Antichrist, which happens after the rapture of the church.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.580
Now look at the second seal.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.340
In verses 3 and 4, the Bible says, and when he had opened the second seal, I heard the

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.500
second beast say, come and see.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.740
And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat there

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.580
on to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.820
And there was given unto him, notice this says, a great sword.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.100
Now I believe that as you read through the book of Revelation, and you read of the seal

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.740
judgments, and you read of the trumpet judgments, and you read of the vial or the bowl judgments,

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.700
that they happen in rapid succession.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.580
We find that there's going to be great turmoil, there's going to be the wrath of God during

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.660
that tribulation period, and we find that now this second horse, this red horse that

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.780
comes with power, that says that he has the power to take peace from the earth, that they

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.400
should kill one another.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.420
No doubt this red horse would reveal to us intense war upon the earth, and there'd be

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.179
a great sword.

00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:36.500
Now look at verses 5 and 6.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.540
We're not going to look at all four of these horses this morning.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.340
I'm going to stop here at this third horse.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.220
But it says here in verse number 5, and when he had opened the third seal, I heard the

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.700
third beast say, come and see, and I beheld, and lo, a black horse.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.380
And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand, and I heard a voice in the midst

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.700
of the four beasts say, a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.500
for a penny, and see thou.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.339
hurt not the oil and the wine."

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:10.619
As we look at this third seal that is mentioned here, this black horse, this would be revealing

00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:14.699
to us this great famine that is going to take place.

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:18.700
This great famine is going to be impactful to the point where the Bible describes it

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.340
as being a measure of wheat for a penny.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.059
Now what he's referring to here in three measures of barley for a penny, what he's referring

00:40:27.059 --> 00:40:33.659
to here in this passage of Scripture is that there's going to be a daily wage would only

00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:38.560
buy the normal food for a normal day's food ration.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.500
So a day's wage equals a daily ration of food.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.299
You say, how could that be?

00:40:46.299 --> 00:40:51.500
Surely you don't pay, I know things are more expensive at the grocery store today, but

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:57.060
you don't pay for one ration of food for one individual what you make in a day.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:03.340
But we notice that as the Antichrist is revealed in verse number one and two, and as the rise

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:08.120
of Antichrist and the start of the tribulation, that there's going to be great war that's

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.139
going to lead to great famine.

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:13.660
And this great famine, the Bible tells us that there's going to be a measure of wheat

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.779
for a penny.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.940
Let me just give you a couple of interesting truths this morning.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.900
Again, I'm listening for the trumpet, amen?

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:31.459
I'm looking to the sky for the reality is that our redemption draweth nigh, amen?

00:41:31.459 --> 00:41:37.660
The coming of the Lord is nigh, and I'm so thankful to know that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.459
is coming again, and he's coming right on time.

00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:46.980
You've often heard me say that things are falling into place in our world today.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.739
Listen, there are people today that are looking at all that's taking place and are saying,

00:41:50.739 --> 00:41:53.180
everything's falling apart, everything's going crazy.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:57.680
And the world is going crazy, but God is in control, amen?

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.040
And we find that as God is in control, and as John says to these believers that he's

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:08.220
writing to, he says, listen, you have heard that Antichrist shall come.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.220
Even now are there many Antichrists.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.820
So he deals with the false teachers, but he gives mention to the fact that Antichrist

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.820
shall come.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.820
When's he going to come?

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.820
After the rapture.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.619
Here's what's going to happen.

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:26.699
And I believe that we are definitely getting close to the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:26.699 --> 00:42:32.300
Now let me just, and again, I hope that no one would take the statements that I'm making

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.259
this morning and take them out of context.

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:39.160
I'm simply trying to help us understand how quickly things can change and how this can

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.320
come to pass that quick.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.240
Because when the rapture of the church takes place and Christians are removed and the Antichrist

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:55.559
is revealed and the rise of Antichrist and these seals are opened, it is going to be

00:42:55.559 --> 00:43:01.479
havoc on earth.

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:05.979
The third seal that is mentioned here is world famine.

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:09.860
And let me just share with you some interesting truth.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:15.660
It's terrible what's going on in the Ukraine right now with Russia and all of that situation.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.660
People are dying.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.500
It's a catastrophic situation.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.100
But I'll just use this as an example, and I'm not suggesting that this is this period

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.100
of time.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.699
Just bear with me.

00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:28.059
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying this morning.

00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:29.580
I'm not seeking to set a date.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.619
I'm not seeking to say this is unfolding before our eyes.

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:35.899
I'm simply saying, look at how quickly things can change.

00:43:35.899 --> 00:43:42.360
Do you know that Russia is the number one world exporter of wheat?

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.179
And Ukraine is number five.

00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:56.000
Those two countries account for nearly 33% of the world's export of wheat.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.339
There are decisions already being made with regard to, we're not going to be able to get

00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:00.339
wheat.

00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:01.339
We're not going to be able to do this.

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.339
It's going to increase, so on and so forth.

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:07.339
I read an article this morning, even, about fertilizer that is exported from Russia.

00:44:07.339 --> 00:44:12.419
And how that Brazil, in particular, is in a real big mess because they don't have fertilizer,

00:44:12.419 --> 00:44:17.100
and that's where they import it from is Russia, and Russia's not going to export it, and therefore

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.380
the yield is going to be less, and so on and so forth.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.380
And the cost, and you think that inflation's already hit us?

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.940
It's only going to be worse.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:32.459
It's interesting that in just whatever it's been, 9 or 10 days, 10 days, I guess, since

00:44:32.459 --> 00:44:40.940
the invasion, that the cost of wheat has gone up 44%.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:46.100
And that, what's going on right now, isn't even close to what's going to happen when

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.420
the Antichrist is revealed.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:54.660
Again, I'm not suggesting anything beyond what I'm saying, so don't misunderstand, don't

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.019
take further what I'm saying.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.899
I'm simply helping us to understand this morning that we're really seeing the truth of how

00:45:02.899 --> 00:45:05.140
quickly these things can take place.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:10.660
I think about this when the book of Revelation talks about the two witnesses and how that

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.980
the whole world is going to see them.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.179
You know, for many people, for many generations, it is almost impossible to figure out how

00:45:17.179 --> 00:45:19.260
that could take place.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.619
But for us today, with the advancements in technology, you can see things all over, you

00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:30.940
can see video from all over the world, active, live video right now.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.179
And so we see that these things are absolutely possible, and there are some people that say,

00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:38.899
oh, look at all that we have, look at all that this is, it's not possible that that's

00:45:38.899 --> 00:45:39.899
ever going to happen.

00:45:39.899 --> 00:45:46.739
A day's wage is not, to buy a daily ration of food, and that third seal, that's what's

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:48.739
going to happen.

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:50.940
That's what God tells us.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.739
And so we don't know when Antichrist is going to rise, but we know that it's going to happen

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:56.459
after the rapture.

00:45:56.459 --> 00:46:02.420
And we know that as we look at these truths that God gives us with regard to the false

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:07.619
teaching that is so prevalent and how that it leads to the culmination of the rapture

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:13.380
of the church and, of course, the Antichrist being revealed, the reality is that our focus

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.739
should be on the soon return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:19.820
He's coming again.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.859
And with everything that's going on in our world, with everything that's taking place,

00:46:23.859 --> 00:46:28.380
and as you enter into the very next section of 1 John, I'll preach on this next week,

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:35.019
but in verse number 28, he says, and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear,

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:41.299
he immediately goes from that internal threat to the false teachers, to the Antichrist,

00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:42.299
as he describes them.

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:46.179
And he says, listen, I want you to abide in him, and I want you to understand that he's

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:51.140
going to appear, when he shall appear, that we may have confidence and not be ashamed

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.739
before him, it is coming.

00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:57.480
And he deals with the return of the Lord Jesus Christ, it'll be our focus next week.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.299
But I ask ourselves this question, are we ready?

00:47:01.299 --> 00:47:03.739
Are we ready for the return of the Lord?

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:08.420
We understand some of these things that are taking place, and we notice what's going on

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.420
in the world.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:13.760
Listen, it's only going to get a whole lot worse after we leave.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.600
After the rapture of the church, it's going to get so much worse, because that same passage

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.600
of Scripture in 2 Thessalonians, that speaks about the mystery of iniquity doth already

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.660
work, it says, only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:32.600
And I believe that that's referring to the Holy Spirit of God, who is the restrainer

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.000
of all of this wickedness, and the Holy Spirit of God indwells in the people of God, and

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.279
when the rapture takes place, then he that letteth, that restrains, only he who now letteth

00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:47.559
will let, until he be taken out of the way.

00:47:47.559 --> 00:47:49.119
The havoc upon earth.

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:54.480
Listen, I'm thankful I'm not going to be here for the tribulation.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480
I am thankful.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.480
But there are some lost people that I know, there are some lost people that you know,

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.799
that they think it's bad right now.

00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:10.679
We know that this pales in comparison to what will be.

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:11.679
Amen?

00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:23.320
And this morning, the false teaching is so prevalent, we must understand the way that

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:30.320
these false teachers are exposed, and we must be faithful to continue in that enabling of

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.559
the Holy Spirit of God to lift up the name of Christ, and to do everything that God would

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:41.640
enable us to do to redeem the time to make a difference.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.599
Souls are dying.

00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:46.200
We have a unique opportunity.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:53.760
Souls are being deceived, and we have the truth of this book.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.840
And God's given us the warning.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.640
I hope that we would take the warning.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:05.679
I hope that as a church, one of the jobs of a pastor is to protect the flock, and I understand

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.559
the fact that God is the shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ is the shepherd, the head of

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:14.559
the church, but the pastor is the under-shepherd, and the responsibility is to protect the flock

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.000
of God.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.719
Individually, we find that the false teaching, listen, don't believe everything you listen

00:49:22.719 --> 00:49:28.239
to on YouTube, please.

00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:31.599
Don't listen to every preacher that's on the Internet and say, well, this preacher said,

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:36.159
and he sounded right, and I'm just going to go with it.

00:49:36.159 --> 00:49:41.119
You can find scores and scores and scores of false teachers out there, and God gives

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:51.359
us a warning of the tactic of the enemy to corrupt not only externally but internally.

00:49:51.359 --> 00:49:53.799
Antichrist will come.

00:49:53.799 --> 00:49:57.080
I'm not going to be here.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.799
But I'm here when the antichrists, the false teachers...

00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:07.559
are doing what they're doing. And so are you. And so we must be prepared for that and we

00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:12.599
must engage in that. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving

00:50:12.599 --> 00:50:17.679
us. We thank You for the truth of Your Word, the power of Your Word. We thank You for that

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:23.439
which has been revealed this morning. I thank You for the warning that's been given about

00:50:23.439 --> 00:50:32.279
this tactic of the enemy internally. God, I pray that You'd help us to know the truth,

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:39.039
help us to stand for truth, help us to fight the good fight. Lord, I pray that You would

00:50:39.039 --> 00:50:43.719
help us to earnestly contend for the faith and that You would enable us, Lord, to be

00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:48.999
doers of the Word and not hearers only. I pray, Father, that You would move and work

00:50:48.999 --> 00:50:54.359
in hearts and lives as only You can. If there's someone that's not sure of heaven, oh God,

00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:58.959
I pray that today they would get it settled. Today is the day of salvation. That before

00:50:58.959 --> 00:51:03.519
it's eternally too late, that they would get it settled. Lord, for every believer, I pray

00:51:03.519 --> 00:51:13.439
that You'd help us to receive the warning on how these false teachers are exposed and

00:51:13.439 --> 00:51:19.639
then could rejoice in the enabling of the Holy Spirit of God to be able to perceive

00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:26.079
and to proceed. I pray that You'd help us to continue and that we'd serve You faithfully.

00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:33.679
Use us to be Your representatives, Your ambassadors in these evil days. We pray that You'd work

00:51:33.679 --> 00:51:36.959
and move as only You can. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads

00:51:36.959 --> 00:51:41.439
are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does,

00:51:41.439 --> 00:51:46.359
the altar is open. Maybe you want to come and thank God for the truth, the warning.

00:51:46.359 --> 00:51:51.199
Warnings are good. Maybe this morning you've been deceived. Maybe you've been listening

00:51:51.199 --> 00:51:56.799
to some false teaching. You've gotten some things and maybe you've lent your ear to those

00:51:56.799 --> 00:52:00.839
things. You need to ask the Lord to help you. Maybe this morning there's some people that

00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:06.359
you know that though you won't be here when the Antichrist is revealed, they will and

00:52:06.359 --> 00:52:10.439
maybe you want to pray for them. Ask God to give you unique opportunities of being able

00:52:10.439 --> 00:52:15.719
to share the gospel with them, to give them the truth. As Kimberly plays, the altar is

00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:16.119
open.
