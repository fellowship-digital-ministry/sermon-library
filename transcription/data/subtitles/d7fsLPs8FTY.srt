1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
this evening, Genesis chapter 49.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,760
Last week, we looked at verses one through 12,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,119
and we really dealt with the subject

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,640
with regard to Jacob blessing his sons.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,640
And last week, we looked at Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,280
and we had the opportunity to look at them last week.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,479
And this week, we will continue here in Genesis 49,

8
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:25,760
verses 13 through 19.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,579
And as we look this evening, we mentioned last week,

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,319
it's part two, but let me just give you

11
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,200
a very quick overview.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,319
We mentioned last week that Jacob knew

13
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,799
that he was near the end of his life.

14
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,259
In fact, it's here in this chapter

15
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,319
that we read of the death of Jacob,

16
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:44,360
and we find that, of course, that is something

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,599
that each of us ought to be prepared for.

18
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:49,439
When is it that we will take our final breath?

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,520
In fact, someone shared with me an account this morning

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,720
of someone out sharing the gospel,

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,439
and they'd heard this story, a firsthand account.

22
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,659
It wasn't them that was out sharing the gospel,

23
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,939
but someone had shared this story,

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,940
and the individual that they were speaking to

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,059
was in their middle age, 40, mid-40, something like that,

26
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,580
and they said, oh, no, I'm not in need of that.

27
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm perfectly fine.

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,300
I got plenty of time.

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,860
And the folks that were out knocking doors

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,599
were knocking doors down the block,

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,800
and sure enough, just a little while later,

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,500
an ambulance came to that house,

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,459
and that person had a massive heart attack

34
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,260
and entered into eternity.

35
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:28,239
Yeah, I mean, listen, our lives are fragile.

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,760
Indeed, as David said, there's but a step

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,919
between me and death, and we find every day

38
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:39,559
that people die that do not expect that they will die

39
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,199
that morning when they wake up,

40
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,519
whether it's a car accident or something other,

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,860
and we know that life is precious,

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,559
and God has given us that gift,

43
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,239
but we find that Jacob, knowing that he would soon die,

44
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,080
he's making some preparation.

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,120
He calls for his sons to enter into his room,

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,940
they gather themselves together.

47
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,500
We mentioned last week that there's a purpose

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,819
for this gathering.

49
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,459
There is a process that is followed,

50
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,339
but also as we look at the particular dialogue

51
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,940
that takes place, there is a prophetic view.

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,660
We find that as Jacob would give these particular blessings,

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,460
if you will, that Jacob has not only the immediate,

54
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,539
but future, and many times,

55
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,740
even as we look last week at Judah,

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,240
all the way into the millennial reign of Christ,

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,759
and it's quite phenomenal, and we understand

58
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,559
that God is a God who is outside of time.

59
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:37,000
He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the end,

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,759
and so we find that as these sons stand before their father,

61
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,979
we mentioned last week what the scene must be like,

62
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,880
and a measure, really, of sobriety

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,119
as they would stand there, and we find that

64
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:53,160
as these boys would stand before their dad

65
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,860
as we look last week, various things are discussed,

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,419
and we find the blessings are given out.

67
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,460
In verse number 28, the Bible says all these

68
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,660
are the 12 tribes of Israel, and this is it

69
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,940
that their father spake unto them and blessed them.

70
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,839
Everyone, according to his blessing, he blessed them.

71
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,580
This evening, as we continue studying

72
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,360
through this portion of scripture,

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,940
we'll look at the life of Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, and Gad,

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
and so we look at all four of these men this evening,

75
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,559
verses 13 down through verse number 19.

76
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,679
You'll understand this evening that as we look

77
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,800
at the portion of scripture and we understand

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,000
the Genesis record that God has given us,

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,759
last week with some of the sons that we looked at,

80
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,360
there was some information that God had given us

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,259
in the record of Genesis about the lives

82
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,399
of those individuals.

83
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,559
Tonight, as we look at these four sons,

84
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,679
there's really not a whole lot in the Genesis record

85
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,580
that God gives us about their lives,

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,020
about their behavior, any of that sort of thing,

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,699
and so as we look at the text of scripture,

88
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,380
we find that Jacob begins in verse 13,

89
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,220
and it says, Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea,

90
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,720
and he shall be for an haven of ships,

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,179
and his border shall be unto Zidon.

92
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:16,540
Issachar is a strong ass, couching down

93
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:20,880
between two burdens, and he saw that rest was good

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,079
and the land that it was pleasant,

95
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,399
bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute.

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,880
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Dan shall be a serpent by the way,

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,959
and adder in the path that biteth the horse heels

99
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,959
so that his rider shall fall backward.

100
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,239
I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord Gad.

101
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:47,480
A troop shall overcome him,

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,859
but he shall overcome at the last.

103
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,119
Just as we did last week,

104
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,820
the points tonight will be the names of the sons,

105
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,179
and so number one, if you're taking notes,

106
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,299
look at Zebulun in verse number 13.

107
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,179
Notice what Jacob says.

108
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,899
He says thou shall, he says shall dwell

109
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,220
at the haven of the sea,

110
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,820
and he shall be for an haven of ships.

111
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,579
Mentions his border shall be unto Zidon.

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,239
As we look at these particular statements

113
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,720
that are given in verse 13,

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,959
and we couple that with Deuteronomy 33,

115
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,359
remember it's in Deuteronomy 33

116
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,040
that Moses prior to his death,

117
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,959
he makes reference to the tribes of Israel,

118
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,679
and what he says about Zebulun there

119
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,440
in that portion of scripture in Deuteronomy 33 in verse 18,

120
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,679
it says rejoice at thy going out.

121
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,519
Rejoice at thy going out.

122
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,160
So we see the reference here with being a haven of the sea,

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,079
and he shall be for an haven of ships.

124
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,359
Speaking about his border,

125
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,799
which the border never quite made it to Zidon,

126
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,600
but we see again the future view,

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,839
the prophetic view with regard

128
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,559
to the blessing of Jacob here,

129
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:03,000
and so we find that Moses says rejoice at thy going out.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,920
It's interesting, Jesus speaks about Zebulun,

131
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,399
the tribe there, if you will, in Matthew 4,

132
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,679
and just a couple of references

133
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,760
that help us kind of get a picture here

134
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,079
of what's going on,

135
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
and the borders, if you will, of Zebulun,

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,679
and we look in verse number 13 of Matthew 4,

137
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,779
and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum,

138
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,279
which is upon the sea coast,

139
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,739
and the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalem,

140
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:29,739
that it might be fulfilled,

141
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,660
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,

142
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,500
saying the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtalem,

143
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,220
by the way of the sea beyond Jordan,

144
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,859
Galilee of the Gentiles,

145
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,880
and so as we begin to look at these references of scripture

146
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,459
with regard to the haven of the sea

147
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,500
and be for a haven of ships,

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,660
we would find that as you look at the descendants of Zebulun

149
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,779
really they can best be described as being merchants.

150
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,700
Their border never fully reached the Mediterranean,

151
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,000
nor did it fully reach the Sea of Galilee,

152
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,079
but we find that they were tucked within that region,

153
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,040
and as being such, they would be merchants,

154
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,279
and there would be much travel that would take place,

155
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,040
and we find that as we would consider their position,

156
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,959
if you will, their place, as Jacob mentions it,

157
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,880
we understand the need and how nations

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,019
would be dependent upon those that would be merchants.

159
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,760
It's interesting that in 2 Chronicles,

160
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,279
or excuse me, 1 Chronicles chapter number 12,

161
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,399
and you might wanna stick a bookmark there,

162
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,600
maybe a ribbon if you have them in your Bible,

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,559
we'll make reference here to 1 Chronicles 12

164
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,640
a couple of times this evening,

165
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,040
but in 1 Chronicles 12, in verse 33,

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,700
and again in verse number 40,

167
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,399
we read some things that God gives us about Zebulun here.

168
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,959
Notice what the Bible says in verse 33

169
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,359
of 1 Chronicles 12.

170
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,959
1 Chronicles 12, 33,

171
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,880
of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle,

172
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,320
expert in war, with all instruments of war,

173
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
50,000, which could keep rank,

174
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,119
then notice what it says, they were not of double heart.

175
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:15,200
That's a good testimony that would be said there,

176
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,000
but look in verse 40 with regard to the idea of merchants

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,839
and looking at these descendants.

178
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,679
It says in verse 40, moreover,

179
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,500
they that were nigh them,

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,079
even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali,

181
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,119
brought bread on asses and on camels

182
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,520
and on mules and on oxen and meat, meal,

183
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,799
cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil

184
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,159
and oxen and sheep abundantly,

185
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,520
for there was joy in Israel.

186
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,039
And so as Zebulun would stand,

187
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,840
again, we don't know very much from the Genesis record

188
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,239
with regard to these that we'll be looking at this evening,

189
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,400
but when he stood there before his father,

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,559
we find that Jacob says that he would dwell

191
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,840
at the haven of the sea and shall be for a haven of ships.

192
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,840
And then Moses says, rejoice at thy going out.

193
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,119
And so this evening, as we look at Zebulun

194
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,479
and understand maybe what his position would be

195
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,140
and what those descendants would be known for

196
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,820
as being merchants.

197
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,200
We then look at Issachar in verses 14 and 15,

198
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
and we find that the Bible tells us

199
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,239
something interesting here about Issachar as well.

200
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,039
And I'm gonna try to make application

201
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,080
with both Zebulun and Issachar here

202
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,799
after we look at verses 14 and 15.

203
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,479
The Bible says that Issachar in verse 14

204
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,880
is a strong ass couching down between two burdens.

205
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,760
And he saw that rest was good

206
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,119
and the land that it was pleasant

207
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,599
and bowed his shoulder to bear

208
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,599
and became a servant unto tribute.

209
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:51,280
As we look at those particular statements that are made

210
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,479
and we begin to think about the usefulness, if you will,

211
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,440
when he talks about being, in verse 14,

212
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
there's a strong ass.

213
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,920
couching down between two burdens,

214
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,260
the strength, the dependability,

215
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,600
the usefulness,

216
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,560
the land that they would be given.

217
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,200
In v. 15, it says that He saw

218
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,460
that rest was good

219
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,480
and the land that it was pleasant,

220
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,040
the land that they would inherit

221
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,840
was a land that was quite fruitful.

222
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,040
It was a land that produced much.

223
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,380
And so we find that He also,

224
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,840
it seems as if when it says

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,620
that He bowed His shoulder to bear,

226
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,380
there was no reluctance on the part of hard work

227
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,880
and doing what needed to be done.

228
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,920
And we find that it says in Deuteronomy 33,

229
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,720
in v. 18, when Moses is sharing the blessings,

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,460
if you will, before his death,

231
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,740
He said to Zebulun,

232
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,180
rejoice at thy going out,

233
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,900
but of Issachar, it says,

234
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,320
rejoice in thy tents.

235
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,200
Rejoice at thy going out to Zebulun,

236
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,560
but rejoice in thy tents.

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,400
When we look at Issachar,

238
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,040
as I mentioned that it seems as if Zebulun,

239
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,560
that his descendants were known as merchants,

240
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,440
if you will,

241
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
and we look at Issachar

242
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,960
and they would be known as being farmers.

243
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,120
Those that would work the land,

244
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
those that would help to sustain a nation.

245
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
And the reality is that we find

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,840
that any nation is dependent

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
on merchants and farmers.

248
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,960
And I think about farming in America,

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,640
and obviously much of our farmland in America

250
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,400
has been sold and it's been purchased

251
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,760
for various means and what have you.

252
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,480
And really that can become a critical issue

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,800
to a nation with regard to its sustenance that it needs

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,960
and the productivity of that particular land

255
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,920
and the yield that is required to sustain its people.

256
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,520
And so we find here this evening

257
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,920
that as we look at this portion of scripture

258
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,320
and we think about these two men

259
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,520
and really what their descendants would be,

260
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,760
we're given a little bit of additional insight.

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I told you to hold your place there in 1 Chronicles 12.

262
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,600
And I want you to see what the Bible says of these

263
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,760
that are of the tribe, if you will,

264
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,120
of Zebulun in 1 Chronicles.

265
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
Notice what the Bible says.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,440
We've read verse 33 and verse number 40,

267
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,860
but look at verse number 32 with me.

268
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,580
The Bible says, and of the children of Issachar,

269
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,940
which were men that had understanding of the times

270
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,220
to know what Israel ought to do,

271
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,860
the heads of them were 200,

272
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,140
and all their brethren were at their commandment.

273
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,540
And I like that the Bible says of the men of Issachar here,

274
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,020
the children of Issachar,

275
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,660
that they were men that had understanding of the times

276
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,060
to know what Israel ought to do.

277
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,740
We see again with regard to the inheritance

278
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,700
that both of these men would receive

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,560
and what their tribes would be known for.

280
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,880
But we also notice as we look here at these two tribes

281
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,780
and these two individuals, Zebulun and Issachar,

282
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,860
and I'm mindful this evening

283
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,300
that it's important for us to be content

284
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,460
with what God's plan is for our lives.

285
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,700
You know, not everyone could be a Judah.

286
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,300
There were those that needed to be merchants

287
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,220
and those that needed to be farmers,

288
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,020
and we find that the land was given,

289
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,460
and I mentioned not everyone could be a Judah

290
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,300
because Judah was that tribe

291
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,580
where the kings would come from.

292
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,620
And we find that as we look this evening

293
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,420
and we understand that God has a plan for each of us,

294
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,500
that God's plan for each of us

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,660
as we determine that we're going to be content

296
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,900
with the place that God has for us,

297
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,180
and we're gonna determine

298
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,740
that we're going to thrive in that place,

299
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,660
that we're going to accept what God's plan is for us,

300
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,300
then collectively and corporately,

301
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,480
we can see God do some great things.

302
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,020
You find that there were those

303
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,220
that would rebel in the Old Testament.

304
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,780
We find even in the New Testament

305
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,380
that those that would resist the leadership

306
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,020
and how they desired to have a position or a place

307
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,220
that was not given to them.

308
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,900
It was not their lot, and there was turmoil,

309
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,100
there was conflict, there was contention and division,

310
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,740
and there was judgment because of it.

311
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,020
But this evening, we find that as we look

312
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,820
at these portions of Scripture

313
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,660
with regard to these particular descendants,

314
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,500
that it's a reminder for us tonight

315
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,100
that God has a plan for each of us.

316
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,900
And I'm thankful that as God has a plan for each of us,

317
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,540
that we can embrace what that plan is.

318
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,900
You know, it's a sad thing for God to have equipped you,

319
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,860
for God to have called you

320
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,580
and has a purpose and a plan for you,

321
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,779
and all the while, you don't embrace it

322
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,180
while you're trying to do something

323
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,500
that God hasn't really called you or equipped you to do.

324
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,619
And I'll tell you this evening,

325
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,580
that could be quite frustrating,

326
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,619
and it causes much problem.

327
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:10,100
We find this evening that when we look at this truth

328
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,500
in 1 Chronicles 12, when the Bible says

329
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,740
there were men of understanding of the times,

330
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,260
I'm thankful this evening that we have a Bible.

331
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,059
And as we have the whole canon of Scripture

332
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,820
that God would allow us to have an understanding

333
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,860
of the times, if we could say as the children of Issachar

334
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,700
that they were men that had understanding of the times,

335
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,339
that we today, as the people of God,

336
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,540
we need to have an understanding

337
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,420
of what God has revealed to us in His Word.

338
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,220
Listen, we don't have to fear tomorrow.

339
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,380
I didn't say that we should be ignorant of tomorrow.

340
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,740
I simply said we don't have to fear tomorrow.

341
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,339
It's okay for us to be informed.

342
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,300
It's okay for us to have an understanding of what's going on,

343
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,779
but when we go to God's Word

344
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,740
and we have an understanding of the times

345
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,460
because this is what God has revealed to us,

346
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,220
this is what God has given us,

347
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,180
we know, we know that there's going to be a rapture.

348
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,540
And we know that one of the things that has to happen

349
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,260
upon that, just all the events that are gonna take place,

350
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,940
but when that rapture takes place and the church is gone,

351
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,140
there's a peace treaty that is given,

352
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,660
that is marked by the Antichrist.

353
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,940
We understand that.

354
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,180
Listen, there has to be a lot of turmoil

355
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,380
in order for a peace treaty to be necessary.

356
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,900
Does that make sense tonight?

357
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,580
There's no need for a peace treaty if there's peace, right?

358
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,339
And so we see things and say, man, it's getting crazy

359
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,300
and all this stuff going on.

360
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,380
Listen, just keep reading your Bible.

361
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,940
God has revealed some things to us in His Word.

362
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,380
I think about Samuel when he's told

363
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,339
after the call of the Lord comes and he goes to Eli

364
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,779
and Eli says, no, no, I didn't call you.

365
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,180
And he says, here's what you need to do.

366
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,140
Say, speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.

367
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,300
And really the idea as we look there

368
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,180
in that portion of scripture is that,

369
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,380
you know what God revealed to Samuel?

370
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,540
He revealed to Samuel things that were going to happen,

371
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,580
future tense, and the judgment that was going to come,

372
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,900
and that's what he revealed to Samuel.

373
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,740
And God's given us His Word

374
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
and He wants us to have an understanding.

375
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,820
Listen, as Christians, as the people of God,

376
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,580
we shouldn't be afraid and worried and fretting

377
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,260
and running all, no, no, no, we're trusting God

378
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,220
that He has a plan, has a purpose.

379
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,540
And I'm thankful that He's in control.

380
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,500
And this evening, it seems as if there's all kinds of,

381
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,540
I mean, every day you turn on the news,

382
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,700
there's something else going on, something else going on,

383
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,380
another headline that comes on.

384
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,420
If you have notifications on your phone,

385
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,820
push notifications, I don't care which news agency you have,

386
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,980
I'm sure that there are apps,

387
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,260
all of them have push notifications,

388
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,020
you get things on your phone.

389
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,779
This happened and that happened and so on and so forth.

390
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,300
And listen, get in the book,

391
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,580
have an understanding that God is sovereign

392
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,540
and God is in control and God has a plan.

393
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,500
As we continue back in Genesis chapter 49,

394
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,540
notice as we look there at these first two

395
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,260
with Zebulun and Issachar, we then come to Dan.

396
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,500
Notice what the Bible says in verse 16,

397
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,860
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.

398
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,779
Dan shall be a serpent, by the way,

399
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,760
an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels

400
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,580
so that his rider shall fall backward.

401
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Now, it's interesting as we look at the tribe of Dan

402
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,140
and we look here, it says that he'll judge his people

403
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,580
in verse number 16, it says that he shall judge his people,

404
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,419
by the way, his name means to judge,

405
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,780
as one of the tribes of Israel.

406
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,900
Now, as far as we know,

407
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,900
the tribe of Dan never judged Israel as a whole,

408
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,700
but it is of interest

409
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,140
that probably one of the most familiar judges to us

410
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,100
is Samson and he was of the tribe of Dan.

411
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
And we find that you could look at that

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,220
at Judges 13 and verse number two.

413
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,940
And of course, again, a very prominent judge.

414
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,460
There are several judges

415
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,780
that God gives us some information about

416
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,979
and there's chapters that are given

417
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,640
to their time of reigning.

418
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
But then there's some of the judges

419
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,260
that there's just a couple of verses about this man judged

420
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,220
and here's what he, you know, how long he judged

421
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,820
and then it just goes on to the next.

422
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,919
And so it becomes a little bit complicated,

423
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,299
but we know quite a bit about Samson

424
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,059
and he is of the tribe of Dan.

425
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,919
I want you to focus, well, let me say this

426
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,440
before I look at verse number 17.

427
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,679
It's of interest also of note, if you will,

428
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,320
Aholiab, are you familiar with that name?

429
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,919
Bezalel is the man that God would give the equipping to

430
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,320
for all of the pieces of furniture within the tabernacle

431
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,760
after God had revealed the instructions,

432
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,239
the blueprints, if you will, to Moses.

433
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,559
But not only Bezalel, but Aholiab,

434
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,080
they would be the two men that God would use

435
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,320
not only in the construction of, but also.

436
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,360
in teaching and instructing others how to do those things in order to make all

437
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,600
of the furniture for the tabernacle and what have you, and he is of the tribe of

438
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,640
Dan. You can see that in Exodus 38 and verse number 23. I just thought that was

439
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,520
quite interesting because Aholiab is kind of a prominent figure when you look

440
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,840
in the book of Exodus and all that's going on with the tabernacle, and what a

441
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,520
blessing to think about his work there with the tabernacle along with Bezalel.

442
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,600
But I want to focus as we look at Dan where it says in verse 17,

443
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,880
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, but notice what it says,

444
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,040
an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall

445
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,640
backward. Now that doesn't sound very positive, does it? And we think about a

446
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,280
serpent and we think about an adder and we see that it says here that it biteth

447
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,880
the horse heels, but this is so that his rider shall fall backward.

448
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,680
When we think about Dan, it's interesting because Dan as a tribe,

449
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,480
if you will, they were the ones that introduced idol worship to the nation.

450
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,400
Turn over, if you will, to Judges 18. In Judges chapter 18, in truth,

451
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,120
we could read the entirety of the chapter this evening and see all that takes place

452
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,600
and how Dan unfortunately introduced the idol worship to the nation.

453
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,000
We will not have time to read all of it this evening.

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,840
You're familiar with the fact that throughout the book of Judges,

455
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,600
the Bible says that there was no king in Israel and the people, well,

456
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,000
they did that which was right in their own eyes or their own sight.

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,240
But I want you to notice down, if you will, in Judges 18 in verse number 30,

458
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,720
the Bible says, and the children of Dan set up the graven image.

459
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,360
And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were

460
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,640
priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

461
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,200
And they set them up Micah's graven image,

462
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,320
which he made all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

463
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,040
When I think about the phrase there in verse 17, when Jacob says,

464
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,720
a serpent, by the way, an adder in the path,

465
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,960
and he talks about biting the horse heels and the rider falling backward,

466
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,200
I think about the responsibility of Dan as a tribe,

467
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,600
introducing idol worship into the nation of Israel

468
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,320
and the adverse impact that it had on the nation.

469
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,560
If you were to think about Israel as a nation, no doubt,

470
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,520
as you have studied the Old Testament, you would find that over and over again,

471
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,680
not only Israel, but Judah as well, they were guilty regularly of idolatry,

472
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,440
idol worship.

473
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,800
We find it here in Judges 18, but I want you to also look over,

474
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,400
if you will, at 1 Kings 12.

475
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:06,600
In 1 Kings 12, we begin to read of an important time in Israel's history.

476
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,080
We find that Israel up to this point in 1 Kings 12,

477
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,640
they've had three kings, Saul, David, and Solomon.

478
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,400
Under the reign of those three kings, it's a united kingdom, it's Israel.

479
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,880
But we find that when we come to 1 Kings 12, the death of Solomon has been recorded,

480
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,120
and we find that after the death of Solomon, at the end of chapter 11,

481
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,000
that what happens is there's a divided kingdom.

482
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,160
We speak about the divided kingdom often will refer to Israel

483
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,920
and will refer to Judah.

484
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,040
We refer to Israel, we refer to the ten tribes of the north,

485
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,320
we refer to Judah, we're speaking about the two tribes of the south.

486
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,000
We see that in Israel's history, it was a downward spiral the entire way.

487
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There's no time in Israel's history after the divided kingdom

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,720
that there's any revival, there are no kings that we would say,

489
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,280
these are good kings.

490
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,200
On the other hand, when you look at Judah, and you look at Judah's history,

491
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,320
you'll find that Judah had some good kings.

492
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,600
There were some that were better than others, but they had some good kings.

493
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
And we find that not only did they have good kings,

494
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,240
but there were periods of time in Judah's history where they had revival.

495
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,960
And I mean, they had genuine revival.

496
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,600
I mean, they cleansed the temple, they got out all of the idolatry.

497
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
I mean, they did business with God.

498
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,800
There was repentance, there was cleansing.

499
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:48,360
I mean, it's phenomenal when you read about some of the revival in Judah's history.

500
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,040
We find that there was a concern, as we read of here in 1 Kings chapter number 12,

501
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,000
there was some concern on the part of Jeroboam

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,920
when this divided kingdom was going to take place

503
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,520
because the law of God required that the males of the children of Israel,

504
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,960
they go back to Jerusalem on certain times of the year

505
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,720
for the purpose of worship and feast.

506
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,399
And so we find that this was of concern to Jeroboam.

507
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,080
Why? Well, when they go back down there, then they're going to desert us,

508
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,000
and they're going to go back, and he's all kind of concerned.

509
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,480
And so we read in chapter 25,

510
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,119
and let me just say this before I begin to read the text,

511
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:33,040
there are times that you'll read through the Kings and the Chronicles

512
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,960
where the Bible will say something in the Kings specifically

513
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,960
that he did after the sins of Jeroboam.

514
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,480
Have you read that statement? You've read that phraseology?

515
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,399
And so it's referring back to exactly what we're going to look at this evening

516
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,480
with regard to the sins of Jeroboam.

517
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,320
And so look in verse 25 of 1 Kings chapter 12,

518
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,480
and I want you to see that the Bible says,

519
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in Mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein,

520
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,839
and went out from Thence, and built Penuel.

521
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,559
And Jeroboam said in his heart,

522
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,440
Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David,

523
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,800
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.

524
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,839
Now understand when he says go up to Jerusalem,

525
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,399
he's not talking about north, south, east, west.

526
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,000
He's talking about topography, elevation.

527
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,880
Jerusalem is always referred to as going up to Jerusalem.

528
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Why? Because Jerusalem has a higher elevation.

529
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,080
And so don't let that directional idea kind of confuse you

530
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,640
because Israel's way up in the north,

531
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
the 10 tribes where he's going to talk about Dan here in just a moment,

532
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,839
way up in the north.

533
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,559
And so he says that what's going to happen is the people are going to go up

534
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,399
to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.

535
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:49,480
Then shall the heart of the people, this people,

536
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,679
turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rehoboam, king of Judah.

537
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,080
And they shall kill me and go again to Rehoboam, king of Judah.

538
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,839
Whereupon the king took counsel,

539
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,559
and made two calves of gold, and said unto them,

540
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
It is too much for you to go to Jerusalem.

541
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,960
Behold thy gods, O Israel,

542
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,520
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

543
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,440
And he, Jeroboam, sent the one in Bethel,

544
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,040
and the other put he in Dan.

545
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,760
Now I want you to notice, I'm going to pause here,

546
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,839
we're going to read the rest of the text here in just a moment,

547
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,480
but I want you to notice where it says in verse 28 where he says this,

548
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,960
It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem.

549
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,760
You know how he marketed his idolatry? Convenience.

550
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,559
It's too much for you to go all the way over there to Jerusalem.

551
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,360
And he takes these two, the Bible says, two calves of gold,

552
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,800
and he's going to set them up, one in Bethel and one in Dan,

553
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,520
and this is going to be a center of idolatry.

554
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,760
And it's marketed as being convenience.

555
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Listen, we live in a society that's all about convenience.

556
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,360
But you know what Jesus said? He said,

557
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,119
Take up your cross and follow me.

558
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,920
Amen? Is that what he said? That's what he said.

559
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,200
We have many modern conveniences, and I'm all about conveniences,

560
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,440
but I'm not about convenient church. Amen?

561
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,679
It's not about being convenient.

562
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,240
And it's not, listen, I'm never, as long as I pastor this church

563
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
or wherever God would have me, I never intend to send out a survey

564
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
and say, hey, what are you looking for in church?

565
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,080
And then we're going to try to accommodate you.

566
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,039
That's not what we're trying to do. We are who we are.

567
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,559
I've had people say to me over the years,

568
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,520
I've shared it in various settings.

569
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,200
I've had people say, why do you have to take such a strong position

570
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,359
on this, that, and the other thing?

571
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,919
Why can't you just say we believe God and the Bible

572
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,039
and we can all just kind of, because this is what we believe

573
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,720
and we're not ashamed of it.

574
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,160
And this is a biblical foundation, and this is why we believe what we believe.

575
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,359
And we ought to be able to earnestly contend for the faith

576
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,880
that was once delivered to the saints.

577
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,840
And so he markets it as being convenient.

578
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,239
You know, we got this thing going on.

579
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,359
This is Sunday night. You're here, Sunday night crowd.

580
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,760
Praise the Lord for it.

581
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,280
Wednesday night, we have church.

582
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,000
You know, there are a lot of churches that aren't having Sunday night church anymore.

583
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
They're just not.

584
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,479
I'm talking about friends of mine, pastor friends of mine,

585
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:27,200
that aren't having church on Sunday night anymore.

586
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,919
They say, well, you know, it's just too much to kind of go back and forth

587
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,080
and make it a little, and this is, this is just what's happening.

588
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,400
And part of it becomes, unfortunately, where a pastor is sitting there

589
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,720
and saying, well, nobody's coming back on Sunday night.

590
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,119
So is it even worth having the doors open?

591
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,359
Is it even worth going through all the process?

592
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,960
We'll just do something different.

593
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,720
It's not about convenience.

594
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,640
It's about worshiping the Lord and about coming and doing.

595
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,280
And he markets it as convenience.

596
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,440
Notice in verse 30,

597
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
and this thing became

598
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:08,320
a sin. For the people went to worship before the One, even unto Dan. And he made a house

599
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons

600
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,560
of Levi. And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of

601
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,040
the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah. And he offered upon the altar, so did

602
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,160
he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel

603
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,720
the priests of the high places which he had made. So he offered upon the altar which he

604
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,760
had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had

605
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,560
devised of his own heart, and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel. And he offered

606
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:47,360
upon the altar, and burnt incense." Tragic. Tragic. We begin to think about what happens

607
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,400
here and we see the two places, one in Bethel, one in Dan. I stood in the place where the

608
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,440
altar was set up in Dan. They have excavated it, they know where it is, and literally a

609
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,200
couple of years ago when we were in Israel, we stood there. We stood in that place. It's

610
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,560
just sad. But I think about what happened back in the history as we read in Judges 18,

611
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,200
where it's Dan that introduced that idol worship and they were given to idolatry. So now when

612
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,480
Jeroboam is going to set up these two idols, it just simply makes sense that one of them

613
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:28,000
will be in Dan. They're already okay with idol worship. We find that as the scriptures

614
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,000
tell us there in Genesis chapter 49 with regard to Dan and with regard specifically

615
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,480
to the serpent and the adder, "...and biteth the horse heel so that his rider shall fall

616
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
backward." Isn't that a sad situation, a sad commentary when you read what we just read

617
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,000
in 1 Kings chapter 12 and how they would set up a place and they would make offerings and

618
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,760
they would serve these idols? Idolatry is a serious thing. Idolatry, we find, has different

619
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,240
shapes and forms today than it did back in the biblical times. In fact, I would say this

620
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,120
tonight that idolatry in America looks different than idolatry in some other continents of

621
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,640
the world. There are some continents of the world where their idols are little figures

622
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:28,800
that they've made of wood and of stone and they worship them. Idols, you know, John says

623
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,560
in 1 John, little children, keep yourselves from idols. I would say simply this, that

624
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,560
an idol is truly anything that takes the place of God. It can be anything. It can be anything.

625
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,640
It can be sports. It can be a job. It could be a child. It could be a spouse. It could

626
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,140
be, I mean, anything that takes place of God. See, here's what God says in His Word

627
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:05,700
in Colossians 1, that in all things He, Christ, might have the preeminence, that He is first.

628
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:14,160
By the way, we understand this evening that when Christ is first in our lives, that everything

629
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,360
else will work its way out. We'll be able to satisfy all of our responsibilities and

630
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,520
requirements and it's best, listen, in my home, in our home, in our family, it's best

631
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,640
for me to have God first and for Holly to have God first and then our marriage will

632
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,520
be what it's supposed to be. It's appropriate for me to have God first and Holly to have

633
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,880
God first and our children to have God first and then our home can work like it's supposed

634
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,680
to work. See, if I put Holly before God, if Holly puts me before God, all of a sudden

635
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:55,240
things don't work the way they're supposed to work. I ought to desire, listen, as a husband,

636
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,040
you ought to help your wife, especially if you have children at home, you ought to help

637
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:07,200
your wife have time with God because it's going to help your home. It's busy. I get

638
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,600
it. And so as a wife, helping your husband, he's got a job and responsibilities, the time

639
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:23,720
with God is important. We find this evening that idolatry there in Israel, introduced

640
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,480
by Dan. I believe it's very prophetic what we read in Genesis 49. It is of interest when

641
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,560
we think about Dan, some have noted and perhaps you've seen it before as well, that if you

642
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,880
look at Revelation chapter 7 and verses 1 through 8, Dan as a tribe is not mentioned.

643
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,600
We find also that in 1 Chronicles chapters 2 through 10, there's a chronological order

644
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,560
that is given of the tribes, and you'll notice that in that portion of Scripture that Dan

645
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,200
also is missing from there. Now it's interesting if you understand the timeline of the book

646
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,120
of Revelation, and this isn't a lesson on the book of Revelation, but, but Revelation

647
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,880
chapter 7 is in the midst of the tribulation. All right? The rapture's already taken place.

648
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,640
The church age as we know it has ceased to exist. We see that in Revelation 2 and 3 with

649
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,000
the church age. Chapter 4, I believe, is a picture of the rapture and the timing of the

650
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,880
rapture. And then you begin to see the throne room of heaven. You begin to start seeing

651
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,880
the judgments that are beginning to be poured out in chapter 6 and so on and so forth with

652
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,440
regard to the judgments. And we find in chapter number 7 of the book of Revelation, it's still

653
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:39,440
in the midst of the tribulation. So Dan is not mentioned in that portion of Scripture.

654
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,200
Many people have sought to try to answer the question why that is. I don't know exactly.

655
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,460
God doesn't tell us specifically. But it could possibly be that because of their introduction

656
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,280
of idolatry into the nation, that they're missing, they're absent in Revelation chapter

657
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:05,160
number 7. But I will say this, it's of note that in Ezekiel chapter 48, in verses 1 and

658
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,640
2, we find that Dan is included in the list of the tribes. And why is that interesting?

659
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Well, because that's a prophetic view of the millennium. And I think that's of interest

660
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,720
because, again, when we look at Genesis chapter 49, we find that the process and all that's

661
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,800
taking place, the purpose of this whole scene that is given to us, but then the prophetic

662
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,960
view that there's a long view. God is a God that's outside of time. And we can see that

663
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,860
as we study the Scriptures, okay, well, Dan's not here and Dan's not here, but then Dan's

664
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,600
over here. And in Ezekiel 48, verses 1 and 2, in fact, you can look at Ezekiel. It's

665
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,200
very interesting, the lots of land that are given in the book of Ezekiel with regard to

666
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,720
the millennium, completely different than in Joshua's time with regard to where they

667
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,440
got their inheritance. I mean, completely different because that's millennium. And so

668
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,440
we find here this evening, then we look at Dan and we see this prophetic view that is

669
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,800
given. We're reminded this evening of the dangers of idolatry, the dangers of idolatry.

670
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,440
Listen, it breaks my heart when I read things about the nation of Israel and Judah as well

671
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,440
of some of the wickedness that they did, the sacrificing of their children to Molech. You

672
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,120
say, how in the world? That was the pagan practice. How in the world would they be guilty?

673
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,320
This is a slippery slope. They begin to put these idols and they begin to get involved

674
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,920
in idolatry and all that takes place. Listen, it's a dangerous thing. God must be first

675
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,460
in our lives. I wonder this evening as we begin to think about these tribes and begin

676
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,040
to think about the prophetic view here in Genesis 49 and wondering if they would take

677
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:05,680
and God would be prominent and preeminent in their lives, how it could change some things.

678
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,960
See they can't get a redo and the fact of the matter is you and I don't get a redo either.

679
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,160
I said this to someone last week. I was having a meeting with them and I said, listen, you

680
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,200
can't change yesterday, but you can have a reset today. You can determine today. All

681
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,360
of that stuff that happened, there's nothing you can do about it. You can't change it.

682
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,520
You can be upset about it. You can be angry about it. You can, whatever all the emotions

683
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,480
are, but you're not going to change it. But you can have a reset today and you can determine

684
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,920
starting today, I'm going to serve God. He's going to have preeminence in my life. He's

685
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,160
going to be first place. It's amazing to me. Someone has asked us, actually lots of people

686
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,400
have asked over the years, what's the hardest part of pastoring? That's a hard question.

687
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,360
There's a lot of different aspects, but you know one of the hardest things is people not

688
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:07,680
obeying God's Word, especially when you talk to them about it. It's hard. And people will

689
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,360
treat God like, here's the expression that I used, sometimes people treat God and the

690
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,600
church like a fire station. And here's why I use that analogy. How many of you call the

691
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,280
fire department on a weekly basis to see if it's still there? You don't. When do you call

692
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,920
the fire department? When you got an emergency, you got a fire, right? I've never called the

693
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,840
fire department, Brother Mark, and said, hey, I just wanted to find out if you guys still

694
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,880
have trucks. Do they have gas? Do you have water? Do you have hoses? Like, I just want

695
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,280
to make sure you're still operating. I've never made that. Have any of you ever made

696
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,760
that phone call? No. But if I have a fire and I call 911 and I call for the fire department,

697
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm hoping that they're there and they're coming, right? That's not how we treat God

698
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,920
and church.

699
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,760
It's not just when my life is falling apart, oh, I need God, I need church.

700
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,480
No, I need Him every moment of my life.

701
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,200
And I must be careful that I learn lessons and say, look, don't go down the path of idolatry

702
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,960
that we see within Dan and the tribe and introducing it.

703
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,080
No, we must make Christ preeminent in our lives.

704
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,040
Gad is mentioned in verse 19.

705
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,400
Of course, the Bible says in Genesis 49 and verse 19, Gad, a troop shall overcome him,

706
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,360
but he shall overcome at the last.

707
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,040
Again, not a whole lot given to us about Gad.

708
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,960
We find that it says that a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.

709
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:48,600
It says in Deuteronomy 33 and verse number 20 that it talks about his enlarging and his

710
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
strength.

711
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,220
And Moses says like a lion is really kind of the imagery that is given there with regard

712
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,880
to Gad.

713
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,900
We do know of the tribe of Gad.

714
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:04,380
Remember it was Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh that made the decision to

715
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,960
settle on the east side of Jordan.

716
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,700
They saw the land, they saw that it was pleasant.

717
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,660
They really made the request of Moses that they could settle there and they settled.

718
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,260
And we see that it says a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.

719
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,040
Settling there on the east side of Jordan would lead to being regularly attacked.

720
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,820
And we can see of that, we can speak of that.

721
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,240
I mentioned some of it last week with Reuben.

722
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,240
But we find that it says here, but he shall overcome at the last.

723
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,960
And again, I believe a view of prophetic view here with regard to Gad.

724
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,500
There's not a whole lot that's given to us within the scriptures about the tribe of Gad.

725
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,660
There are some that would like to give the idea that some great prophets, Elijah was

726
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
of the tribe of Gad.

727
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,900
I don't know that you can truly prove that biblically.

728
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,860
So you can be careful on some things that you read.

729
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:03,180
I think there's some indication that that could potentially be the case.

730
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,940
But we find that just because someone settled in the region doesn't mean they were necessarily

731
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:16,740
of the tribe of Gad because we know that Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh all settled

732
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,160
in that region.

733
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,780
So it would not necessarily mean that everyone that's in that region is of the tribe of Gad.

734
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,880
And so it's a little bit difficult to be able to understand some of the descendants

735
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,660
with regard to that situation.

736
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,940
But we do trust that even as we've looked at some of these other blessings, that as

737
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,380
Jacob is speaking and he has this view of prophecy, that yes, it was the two-and-a-half

738
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,940
tribes that suffered regularly, undergoing attack, but we find that they were taken captive.

739
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,900
They were the first that were taken captive by the Assyrians.

740
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,060
We mentioned that last week as we looked at Reuben.

741
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,400
But we find that it says, but he shall overcome at the last.

742
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,340
And we just trust the Lord to all that that means.

743
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I don't know.

744
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,140
And you say, well, pastor, how do you stand up there and say, I don't know?

745
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,380
Well, if you know, then you let me know because I don't know.

746
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,340
And it's kind of the same thing I said last week in Sunday school.

747
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,980
We looked at John chapter number five.

748
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,460
I don't understand all the details of how it worked, but I just believe that what God

749
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,000
said is how it worked.

750
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,160
And so that's not a problem.

751
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
That's just how it is.

752
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,640
And so God gives us this here in his word with regard to, but he shall overcome at the

753
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
last.

754
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,840
I think about that from this perspective quickly as application.

755
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,720
Listen, the Bible says the just man falleth seven times, but what does he do?

756
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,240
He rises up again.

757
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,920
And you know, the Bible talks about in the book of 1 John, we read it in the book of

758
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,960
Revelation as well as being overcomers.

759
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,920
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.

760
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,600
It's kind of similar to what I said that I mentioned to someone last week.

761
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,080
Listen, you might have been kicked in the face, so to speak, by the enemy and you might

762
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:06,740
have fallen down, but get up again, be an overcomer, be a victor because greater is

763
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,640
he that is in you than he that is in the world.

764
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,200
And we are to be conquerors.

765
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
We are to be overcomers.

766
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,640
Yes, we have an adversary.

767
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,280
We face opposition and difficulty.

768
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,560
And though we might have been defeated yesterday or today, it doesn't mean that we need to

769
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,520
live in a constant state of defeat.

770
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Amen?

771
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
We overcome.

772
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
We conquer.

773
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,720
We have been promised the victory.

774
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,680
God tells us that we're to put on the whole armor of God and he tells us that we can stand

775
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,040
in these last days and, oh, how we need to stand and, oh, how we need to continue and

776
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,900
we need to be overcomers.

777
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,400
And so we find this evening as we look at these four sons of Jacob, we find the importance

778
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,860
of thriving where God has you.

779
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,360
God has a plan for your life, has a plan for my life, and as God would put us where he

780
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,120
wants us, that we determine that by his grace that we're gonna do what he's called us to

781
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:12,280
do and we are going to seek to please him and to be content with what he has for us

782
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,480
and then collectively and corporately we can fulfill what God's plan is for our lives.

783
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,000
Be careful of idols.

784
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,420
Keep yourselves from idols.

785
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,120
We read that in the New Testament.

786
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,520
And then be an overcomer.

787
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,640
Don't allow the enemy to triumph in your life.

788
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,520
He's a defeated foe.

789
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
I didn't say he's not.

790
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,100
I mean, he's an active foe.

791
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,640
He walketh about seeking whom he may devour, whom resist steadfast in the faith, amen?

792
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,940
And we find that we're to be sober, we're to be vigilant because we have that adversary,

793
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,460
but we're to be overcomers.

794
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:49,220
We cannot allow ourselves to be defeated and just lay down and just live a life of defeat.

795
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,060
How horrible that would be when the victory has been promised to us.

796
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,500
We sing the song, Victory in Jesus, and what a wonderful song it is, and I'm thankful,

797
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:05,980
as Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15, but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through

798
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,500
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen?

799
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
And so what are we to do?

800
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,860
Well, we're to be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing

801
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,900
that our labor, well, our labor's not in vain, amen?

802
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,420
Aren't you thankful for that?

803
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,420
Let's stand together.

804
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,940
Father, we thank you for loving us.

805
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,180
We thank you for your word.

806
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,780
We thank you for the blessings of Jacob and how we can study your word and we can go through

807
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,700
and we can make application in our own lives, and God, I pray that you would help us tonight.

808
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:42,740
I pray that you would help us to take heed, that we would take and apply the truth of

809
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,540
your word in our lives, that we might be conformed to the image of your dear Son, that we might

810
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,820
impact eternity with our lives.

811
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,940
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

812
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,440
God bless you.
