00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
this evening, Genesis chapter 49.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.760
Last week, we looked at verses one through 12,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.119
and we really dealt with the subject

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.640
with regard to Jacob blessing his sons.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.640
And last week, we looked at Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.280
and we had the opportunity to look at them last week.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.479
And this week, we will continue here in Genesis 49,

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:25.760
verses 13 through 19.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.579
And as we look this evening, we mentioned last week,

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.319
it's part two, but let me just give you

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.200
a very quick overview.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.319
We mentioned last week that Jacob knew

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:35.799
that he was near the end of his life.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.259
In fact, it's here in this chapter

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.319
that we read of the death of Jacob,

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.360
and we find that, of course, that is something

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.599
that each of us ought to be prepared for.

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:49.439
When is it that we will take our final breath?

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:53.520
In fact, someone shared with me an account this morning

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.720
of someone out sharing the gospel,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.439
and they'd heard this story, a firsthand account.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.659
It wasn't them that was out sharing the gospel,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.939
but someone had shared this story,

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.940
and the individual that they were speaking to

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.059
was in their middle age, 40, mid-40, something like that,

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:10.580
and they said, oh, no, I'm not in need of that.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.860
I'm perfectly fine.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.300
I got plenty of time.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.860
And the folks that were out knocking doors

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.599
were knocking doors down the block,

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.800
and sure enough, just a little while later,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.500
an ambulance came to that house,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.459
and that person had a massive heart attack

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.260
and entered into eternity.

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.239
Yeah, I mean, listen, our lives are fragile.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.760
Indeed, as David said, there's but a step

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.919
between me and death, and we find every day

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:39.559
that people die that do not expect that they will die

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:41.199
that morning when they wake up,

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:43.519
whether it's a car accident or something other,

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.860
and we know that life is precious,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.559
and God has given us that gift,

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:50.239
but we find that Jacob, knowing that he would soon die,

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.080
he's making some preparation.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.120
He calls for his sons to enter into his room,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.940
they gather themselves together.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.500
We mentioned last week that there's a purpose

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.819
for this gathering.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.459
There is a process that is followed,

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.339
but also as we look at the particular dialogue

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:10.940
that takes place, there is a prophetic view.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.660
We find that as Jacob would give these particular blessings,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.460
if you will, that Jacob has not only the immediate,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.539
but future, and many times,

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.740
even as we look last week at Judah,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.240
all the way into the millennial reign of Christ,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.759
and it's quite phenomenal, and we understand

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.559
that God is a God who is outside of time.

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.000
He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the end,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.759
and so we find that as these sons stand before their father,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.979
we mentioned last week what the scene must be like,

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.880
and a measure, really, of sobriety

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.119
as they would stand there, and we find that

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.160
as these boys would stand before their dad

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.860
as we look last week, various things are discussed,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.419
and we find the blessings are given out.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.460
In verse number 28, the Bible says all these

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.660
are the 12 tribes of Israel, and this is it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.940
that their father spake unto them and blessed them.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.839
Everyone, according to his blessing, he blessed them.

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.580
This evening, as we continue studying

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.360
through this portion of scripture,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.940
we'll look at the life of Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, and Gad,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.880
and so we look at all four of these men this evening,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.559
verses 13 down through verse number 19.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.679
You'll understand this evening that as we look

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.800
at the portion of scripture and we understand

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.000
the Genesis record that God has given us,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.759
last week with some of the sons that we looked at,

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.360
there was some information that God had given us

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.259
in the record of Genesis about the lives

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.399
of those individuals.

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:50.559
Tonight, as we look at these four sons,

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.679
there's really not a whole lot in the Genesis record

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.580
that God gives us about their lives,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.020
about their behavior, any of that sort of thing,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.699
and so as we look at the text of scripture,

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.380
we find that Jacob begins in verse 13,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.220
and it says, Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.720
and he shall be for an haven of ships,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.179
and his border shall be unto Zidon.

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.540
Issachar is a strong ass, couching down

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.880
between two burdens, and he saw that rest was good

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.079
and the land that it was pleasant,

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.399
bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.880
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.440
Dan shall be a serpent by the way,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.959
and adder in the path that biteth the horse heels

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.959
so that his rider shall fall backward.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.239
I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord Gad.

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:47.480
A troop shall overcome him,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.859
but he shall overcome at the last.

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:52.119
Just as we did last week,

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:54.820
the points tonight will be the names of the sons,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.179
and so number one, if you're taking notes,

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.299
look at Zebulun in verse number 13.

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.179
Notice what Jacob says.

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.899
He says thou shall, he says shall dwell

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.220
at the haven of the sea,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.820
and he shall be for an haven of ships.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.579
Mentions his border shall be unto Zidon.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.239
As we look at these particular statements

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.720
that are given in verse 13,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.959
and we couple that with Deuteronomy 33,

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.359
remember it's in Deuteronomy 33

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.040
that Moses prior to his death,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.959
he makes reference to the tribes of Israel,

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.679
and what he says about Zebulun there

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.440
in that portion of scripture in Deuteronomy 33 in verse 18,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.679
it says rejoice at thy going out.

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.519
Rejoice at thy going out.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:44.160
So we see the reference here with being a haven of the sea,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.079
and he shall be for an haven of ships.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.359
Speaking about his border,

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.799
which the border never quite made it to Zidon,

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:53.600
but we see again the future view,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.839
the prophetic view with regard

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.559
to the blessing of Jacob here,

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.000
and so we find that Moses says rejoice at thy going out.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.920
It's interesting, Jesus speaks about Zebulun,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.399
the tribe there, if you will, in Matthew 4,

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:10.679
and just a couple of references

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:12.760
that help us kind of get a picture here

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.079
of what's going on,

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:18.000
and the borders, if you will, of Zebulun,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.679
and we look in verse number 13 of Matthew 4,

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.779
and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum,

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.279
which is upon the sea coast,

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.739
and the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalem,

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:29.739
that it might be fulfilled,

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:31.660
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.500
saying the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtalem,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.220
by the way of the sea beyond Jordan,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.859
Galilee of the Gentiles,

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.880
and so as we begin to look at these references of scripture

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.459
with regard to the haven of the sea

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.500
and be for a haven of ships,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.660
we would find that as you look at the descendants of Zebulun

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.779
really they can best be described as being merchants.

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.700
Their border never fully reached the Mediterranean,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.000
nor did it fully reach the Sea of Galilee,

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:07.079
but we find that they were tucked within that region,

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.040
and as being such, they would be merchants,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.279
and there would be much travel that would take place,

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.040
and we find that as we would consider their position,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.959
if you will, their place, as Jacob mentions it,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:24.880
we understand the need and how nations

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.019
would be dependent upon those that would be merchants.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:30.760
It's interesting that in 2 Chronicles,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.279
or excuse me, 1 Chronicles chapter number 12,

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:35.399
and you might wanna stick a bookmark there,

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.600
maybe a ribbon if you have them in your Bible,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.559
we'll make reference here to 1 Chronicles 12

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.640
a couple of times this evening,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.040
but in 1 Chronicles 12, in verse 33,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.700
and again in verse number 40,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.399
we read some things that God gives us about Zebulun here.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.959
Notice what the Bible says in verse 33

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.359
of 1 Chronicles 12.

00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:57.959
1 Chronicles 12, 33,

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:01.880
of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.320
expert in war, with all instruments of war,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.880
50,000, which could keep rank,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.119
then notice what it says, they were not of double heart.

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:15.200
That's a good testimony that would be said there,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.000
but look in verse 40 with regard to the idea of merchants

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.839
and looking at these descendants.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.679
It says in verse 40, moreover,

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:24.500
they that were nigh them,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.079
even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali,

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:30.119
brought bread on asses and on camels

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:33.520
and on mules and on oxen and meat, meal,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.799
cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.159
and oxen and sheep abundantly,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.520
for there was joy in Israel.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.039
And so as Zebulun would stand,

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.840
again, we don't know very much from the Genesis record

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.239
with regard to these that we'll be looking at this evening,

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:55.400
but when he stood there before his father,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.559
we find that Jacob says that he would dwell

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:02.840
at the haven of the sea and shall be for a haven of ships.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.840
And then Moses says, rejoice at thy going out.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.119
And so this evening, as we look at Zebulun

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:13.479
and understand maybe what his position would be

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.140
and what those descendants would be known for

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.820
as being merchants.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.200
We then look at Issachar in verses 14 and 15,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.440
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.239
something interesting here about Issachar as well.

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:29.039
And I'm gonna try to make application

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.080
with both Zebulun and Issachar here

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.799
after we look at verses 14 and 15.

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:36.479
The Bible says that Issachar in verse 14

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:39.880
is a strong ass couching down between two burdens.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.760
And he saw that rest was good

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.119
and the land that it was pleasant

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:44.599
and bowed his shoulder to bear

00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:47.599
and became a servant unto tribute.

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:51.280
As we look at those particular statements that are made

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.479
and we begin to think about the usefulness, if you will,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.440
when he talks about being, in verse 14,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.760
there's a strong ass.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.920
couching down between two burdens,

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.260
the strength, the dependability,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.600
the usefulness,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.560
the land that they would be given.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.200
In v. 15, it says that He saw

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.460
that rest was good

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.480
and the land that it was pleasant,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.040
the land that they would inherit

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.840
was a land that was quite fruitful.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.040
It was a land that produced much.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.380
And so we find that He also,

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.840
it seems as if when it says

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.620
that He bowed His shoulder to bear,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.380
there was no reluctance on the part of hard work

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.880
and doing what needed to be done.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.920
And we find that it says in Deuteronomy 33,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.720
in v. 18, when Moses is sharing the blessings,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.460
if you will, before his death,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.740
He said to Zebulun,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.180
rejoice at thy going out,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.900
but of Issachar, it says,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.320
rejoice in thy tents.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.200
Rejoice at thy going out to Zebulun,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.560
but rejoice in thy tents.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.400
When we look at Issachar,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.040
as I mentioned that it seems as if Zebulun,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.560
that his descendants were known as merchants,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.440
if you will,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.040
and we look at Issachar

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.960
and they would be known as being farmers.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.120
Those that would work the land,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.440
those that would help to sustain a nation.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.000
And the reality is that we find

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.840
that any nation is dependent

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.440
on merchants and farmers.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.960
And I think about farming in America,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.640
and obviously much of our farmland in America

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.400
has been sold and it's been purchased

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.760
for various means and what have you.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.480
And really that can become a critical issue

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.800
to a nation with regard to its sustenance that it needs

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.960
and the productivity of that particular land

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.920
and the yield that is required to sustain its people.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.520
And so we find here this evening

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.920
that as we look at this portion of scripture

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.320
and we think about these two men

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.520
and really what their descendants would be,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.760
we're given a little bit of additional insight.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.760
I told you to hold your place there in 1 Chronicles 12.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.600
And I want you to see what the Bible says of these

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.760
that are of the tribe, if you will,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.120
of Zebulun in 1 Chronicles.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.600
Notice what the Bible says.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.440
We've read verse 33 and verse number 40,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.860
but look at verse number 32 with me.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.580
The Bible says, and of the children of Issachar,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.940
which were men that had understanding of the times

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.220
to know what Israel ought to do,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.860
the heads of them were 200,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.140
and all their brethren were at their commandment.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.540
And I like that the Bible says of the men of Issachar here,

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.020
the children of Issachar,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.660
that they were men that had understanding of the times

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.060
to know what Israel ought to do.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.740
We see again with regard to the inheritance

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.700
that both of these men would receive

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.560
and what their tribes would be known for.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.880
But we also notice as we look here at these two tribes

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.780
and these two individuals, Zebulun and Issachar,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.860
and I'm mindful this evening

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.300
that it's important for us to be content

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.460
with what God's plan is for our lives.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.700
You know, not everyone could be a Judah.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.300
There were those that needed to be merchants

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.220
and those that needed to be farmers,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.020
and we find that the land was given,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.460
and I mentioned not everyone could be a Judah

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.300
because Judah was that tribe

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.580
where the kings would come from.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.620
And we find that as we look this evening

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.420
and we understand that God has a plan for each of us,

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.500
that God's plan for each of us

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.660
as we determine that we're going to be content

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.900
with the place that God has for us,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.180
and we're gonna determine

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.740
that we're going to thrive in that place,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.660
that we're going to accept what God's plan is for us,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.300
then collectively and corporately,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.480
we can see God do some great things.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.020
You find that there were those

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.220
that would rebel in the Old Testament.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.780
We find even in the New Testament

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.380
that those that would resist the leadership

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.020
and how they desired to have a position or a place

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.220
that was not given to them.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.900
It was not their lot, and there was turmoil,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.100
there was conflict, there was contention and division,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.740
and there was judgment because of it.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.020
But this evening, we find that as we look

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.820
at these portions of Scripture

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.660
with regard to these particular descendants,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.500
that it's a reminder for us tonight

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.100
that God has a plan for each of us.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.900
And I'm thankful that as God has a plan for each of us,

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.540
that we can embrace what that plan is.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.900
You know, it's a sad thing for God to have equipped you,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.860
for God to have called you

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.580
and has a purpose and a plan for you,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.779
and all the while, you don't embrace it

00:14:55.779 --> 00:14:58.180
while you're trying to do something

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.500
that God hasn't really called you or equipped you to do.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.619
And I'll tell you this evening,

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:05.580
that could be quite frustrating,

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.619
and it causes much problem.

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:10.100
We find this evening that when we look at this truth

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.500
in 1 Chronicles 12, when the Bible says

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.740
there were men of understanding of the times,

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.260
I'm thankful this evening that we have a Bible.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.059
And as we have the whole canon of Scripture

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:24.820
that God would allow us to have an understanding

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.860
of the times, if we could say as the children of Issachar

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.700
that they were men that had understanding of the times,

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.339
that we today, as the people of God,

00:15:33.339 --> 00:15:35.540
we need to have an understanding

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.420
of what God has revealed to us in His Word.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.220
Listen, we don't have to fear tomorrow.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.380
I didn't say that we should be ignorant of tomorrow.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.740
I simply said we don't have to fear tomorrow.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.339
It's okay for us to be informed.

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:53.300
It's okay for us to have an understanding of what's going on,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.779
but when we go to God's Word

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.740
and we have an understanding of the times

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.460
because this is what God has revealed to us,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.220
this is what God has given us,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.180
we know, we know that there's going to be a rapture.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.540
And we know that one of the things that has to happen

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.260
upon that, just all the events that are gonna take place,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.940
but when that rapture takes place and the church is gone,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.140
there's a peace treaty that is given,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.660
that is marked by the Antichrist.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.940
We understand that.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.180
Listen, there has to be a lot of turmoil

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.380
in order for a peace treaty to be necessary.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.900
Does that make sense tonight?

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.580
There's no need for a peace treaty if there's peace, right?

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.339
And so we see things and say, man, it's getting crazy

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:40.300
and all this stuff going on.

00:16:41.059 --> 00:16:42.380
Listen, just keep reading your Bible.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.940
God has revealed some things to us in His Word.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.380
I think about Samuel when he's told

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.339
after the call of the Lord comes and he goes to Eli

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:52.779
and Eli says, no, no, I didn't call you.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.180
And he says, here's what you need to do.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.140
Say, speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.300
And really the idea as we look there

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.180
in that portion of scripture is that,

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.380
you know what God revealed to Samuel?

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.540
He revealed to Samuel things that were going to happen,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.580
future tense, and the judgment that was going to come,

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.900
and that's what he revealed to Samuel.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.740
And God's given us His Word

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.740
and He wants us to have an understanding.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.820
Listen, as Christians, as the people of God,

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.580
we shouldn't be afraid and worried and fretting

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.260
and running all, no, no, no, we're trusting God

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.220
that He has a plan, has a purpose.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.540
And I'm thankful that He's in control.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.500
And this evening, it seems as if there's all kinds of,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.540
I mean, every day you turn on the news,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.700
there's something else going on, something else going on,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.380
another headline that comes on.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.420
If you have notifications on your phone,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.820
push notifications, I don't care which news agency you have,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.980
I'm sure that there are apps,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.260
all of them have push notifications,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.020
you get things on your phone.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.779
This happened and that happened and so on and so forth.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:55.300
And listen, get in the book,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.580
have an understanding that God is sovereign

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.540
and God is in control and God has a plan.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.500
As we continue back in Genesis chapter 49,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.540
notice as we look there at these first two

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.260
with Zebulun and Issachar, we then come to Dan.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.500
Notice what the Bible says in verse 16,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.860
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.779
Dan shall be a serpent, by the way,

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:23.760
an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.580
so that his rider shall fall backward.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.580
Now, it's interesting as we look at the tribe of Dan

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.140
and we look here, it says that he'll judge his people

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.580
in verse number 16, it says that he shall judge his people,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.419
by the way, his name means to judge,

00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:40.780
as one of the tribes of Israel.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.900
Now, as far as we know,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.900
the tribe of Dan never judged Israel as a whole,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.700
but it is of interest

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.140
that probably one of the most familiar judges to us

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.100
is Samson and he was of the tribe of Dan.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.500
And we find that you could look at that

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.220
at Judges 13 and verse number two.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.940
And of course, again, a very prominent judge.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.460
There are several judges

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.780
that God gives us some information about

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.979
and there's chapters that are given

00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:11.640
to their time of reigning.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.960
But then there's some of the judges

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.260
that there's just a couple of verses about this man judged

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.220
and here's what he, you know, how long he judged

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.820
and then it just goes on to the next.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.919
And so it becomes a little bit complicated,

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:24.299
but we know quite a bit about Samson

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.059
and he is of the tribe of Dan.

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:28.919
I want you to focus, well, let me say this

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:31.440
before I look at verse number 17.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.679
It's of interest also of note, if you will,

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:37.320
Aholiab, are you familiar with that name?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.919
Bezalel is the man that God would give the equipping to

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:45.320
for all of the pieces of furniture within the tabernacle

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.760
after God had revealed the instructions,

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.239
the blueprints, if you will, to Moses.

00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:54.559
But not only Bezalel, but Aholiab,

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:57.080
they would be the two men that God would use

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.320
not only in the construction of, but also.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.360
in teaching and instructing others how to do those things in order to make all

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.600
of the furniture for the tabernacle and what have you, and he is of the tribe of

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.640
Dan. You can see that in Exodus 38 and verse number 23. I just thought that was

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.520
quite interesting because Aholiab is kind of a prominent figure when you look

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.840
in the book of Exodus and all that's going on with the tabernacle, and what a

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.520
blessing to think about his work there with the tabernacle along with Bezalel.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.600
But I want to focus as we look at Dan where it says in verse 17,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.880
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, but notice what it says,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.040
an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.640
backward. Now that doesn't sound very positive, does it? And we think about a

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.280
serpent and we think about an adder and we see that it says here that it biteth

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.880
the horse heels, but this is so that his rider shall fall backward.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.680
When we think about Dan, it's interesting because Dan as a tribe,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:04.480
if you will, they were the ones that introduced idol worship to the nation.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.400
Turn over, if you will, to Judges 18. In Judges chapter 18, in truth,

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.120
we could read the entirety of the chapter this evening and see all that takes place

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:21.600
and how Dan unfortunately introduced the idol worship to the nation.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.000
We will not have time to read all of it this evening.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.840
You're familiar with the fact that throughout the book of Judges,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.600
the Bible says that there was no king in Israel and the people, well,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.000
they did that which was right in their own eyes or their own sight.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.240
But I want you to notice down, if you will, in Judges 18 in verse number 30,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.720
the Bible says, and the children of Dan set up the graven image.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.360
And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:56.640
priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.200
And they set them up Micah's graven image,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.320
which he made all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.040
When I think about the phrase there in verse 17, when Jacob says,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.720
a serpent, by the way, an adder in the path,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.960
and he talks about biting the horse heels and the rider falling backward,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.200
I think about the responsibility of Dan as a tribe,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.600
introducing idol worship into the nation of Israel

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.320
and the adverse impact that it had on the nation.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.560
If you were to think about Israel as a nation, no doubt,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:41.520
as you have studied the Old Testament, you would find that over and over again,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.680
not only Israel, but Judah as well, they were guilty regularly of idolatry,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.440
idol worship.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.800
We find it here in Judges 18, but I want you to also look over,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.400
if you will, at 1 Kings 12.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:06.600
In 1 Kings 12, we begin to read of an important time in Israel's history.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.080
We find that Israel up to this point in 1 Kings 12,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.640
they've had three kings, Saul, David, and Solomon.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.400
Under the reign of those three kings, it's a united kingdom, it's Israel.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.880
But we find that when we come to 1 Kings 12, the death of Solomon has been recorded,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.120
and we find that after the death of Solomon, at the end of chapter 11,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.000
that what happens is there's a divided kingdom.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.160
We speak about the divided kingdom often will refer to Israel

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.920
and will refer to Judah.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.040
We refer to Israel, we refer to the ten tribes of the north,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.320
we refer to Judah, we're speaking about the two tribes of the south.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.000
We see that in Israel's history, it was a downward spiral the entire way.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
There's no time in Israel's history after the divided kingdom

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.720
that there's any revival, there are no kings that we would say,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.280
these are good kings.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.200
On the other hand, when you look at Judah, and you look at Judah's history,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.320
you'll find that Judah had some good kings.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.600
There were some that were better than others, but they had some good kings.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.320
And we find that not only did they have good kings,

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.240
but there were periods of time in Judah's history where they had revival.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.960
And I mean, they had genuine revival.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.600
I mean, they cleansed the temple, they got out all of the idolatry.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.679
I mean, they did business with God.

00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:40.800
There was repentance, there was cleansing.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:48.360
I mean, it's phenomenal when you read about some of the revival in Judah's history.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.040
We find that there was a concern, as we read of here in 1 Kings chapter number 12,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.000
there was some concern on the part of Jeroboam

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.920
when this divided kingdom was going to take place

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.520
because the law of God required that the males of the children of Israel,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.960
they go back to Jerusalem on certain times of the year

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.720
for the purpose of worship and feast.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.399
And so we find that this was of concern to Jeroboam.

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:20.080
Why? Well, when they go back down there, then they're going to desert us,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.000
and they're going to go back, and he's all kind of concerned.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.480
And so we read in chapter 25,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.119
and let me just say this before I begin to read the text,

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:33.040
there are times that you'll read through the Kings and the Chronicles

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.960
where the Bible will say something in the Kings specifically

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.960
that he did after the sins of Jeroboam.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.480
Have you read that statement? You've read that phraseology?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.399
And so it's referring back to exactly what we're going to look at this evening

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:51.480
with regard to the sins of Jeroboam.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.320
And so look in verse 25 of 1 Kings chapter 12,

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.480
and I want you to see that the Bible says,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.880
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in Mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.839
and went out from Thence, and built Penuel.

00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:07.559
And Jeroboam said in his heart,

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:10.440
Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.800
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.839
Now understand when he says go up to Jerusalem,

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:20.399
he's not talking about north, south, east, west.

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:23.000
He's talking about topography, elevation.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.880
Jerusalem is always referred to as going up to Jerusalem.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.320
Why? Because Jerusalem has a higher elevation.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.080
And so don't let that directional idea kind of confuse you

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.640
because Israel's way up in the north,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.480
the 10 tribes where he's going to talk about Dan here in just a moment,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.839
way up in the north.

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:43.559
And so he says that what's going to happen is the people are going to go up

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:46.399
to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:49.480
Then shall the heart of the people, this people,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.679
turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rehoboam, king of Judah.

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:59.080
And they shall kill me and go again to Rehoboam, king of Judah.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.839
Whereupon the king took counsel,

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:06.559
and made two calves of gold, and said unto them,

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:09.520
It is too much for you to go to Jerusalem.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.960
Behold thy gods, O Israel,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.520
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.440
And he, Jeroboam, sent the one in Bethel,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.040
and the other put he in Dan.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.760
Now I want you to notice, I'm going to pause here,

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.839
we're going to read the rest of the text here in just a moment,

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:34.480
but I want you to notice where it says in verse 28 where he says this,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.960
It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:43.760
You know how he marketed his idolatry? Convenience.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.559
It's too much for you to go all the way over there to Jerusalem.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.360
And he takes these two, the Bible says, two calves of gold,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.800
and he's going to set them up, one in Bethel and one in Dan,

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.520
and this is going to be a center of idolatry.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.760
And it's marketed as being convenience.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.000
Listen, we live in a society that's all about convenience.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.360
But you know what Jesus said? He said,

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.119
Take up your cross and follow me.

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:15.920
Amen? Is that what he said? That's what he said.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.200
We have many modern conveniences, and I'm all about conveniences,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.440
but I'm not about convenient church. Amen?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.679
It's not about being convenient.

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:30.240
And it's not, listen, I'm never, as long as I pastor this church

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.320
or wherever God would have me, I never intend to send out a survey

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.840
and say, hey, what are you looking for in church?

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.080
And then we're going to try to accommodate you.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.039
That's not what we're trying to do. We are who we are.

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:43.559
I've had people say to me over the years,

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:45.520
I've shared it in various settings.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.200
I've had people say, why do you have to take such a strong position

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.359
on this, that, and the other thing?

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:52.919
Why can't you just say we believe God and the Bible

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:56.039
and we can all just kind of, because this is what we believe

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:57.720
and we're not ashamed of it.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.160
And this is a biblical foundation, and this is why we believe what we believe.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.359
And we ought to be able to earnestly contend for the faith

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:05.880
that was once delivered to the saints.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.840
And so he markets it as being convenient.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.239
You know, we got this thing going on.

00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:13.359
This is Sunday night. You're here, Sunday night crowd.

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:14.760
Praise the Lord for it.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.280
Wednesday night, we have church.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.000
You know, there are a lot of churches that aren't having Sunday night church anymore.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.960
They're just not.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.479
I'm talking about friends of mine, pastor friends of mine,

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.200
that aren't having church on Sunday night anymore.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.919
They say, well, you know, it's just too much to kind of go back and forth

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:34.080
and make it a little, and this is, this is just what's happening.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.400
And part of it becomes, unfortunately, where a pastor is sitting there

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.720
and saying, well, nobody's coming back on Sunday night.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.119
So is it even worth having the doors open?

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:45.359
Is it even worth going through all the process?

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:49.960
We'll just do something different.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.720
It's not about convenience.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.640
It's about worshiping the Lord and about coming and doing.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.280
And he markets it as convenience.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.440
Notice in verse 30,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.280
and this thing became

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:08.320
a sin. For the people went to worship before the One, even unto Dan. And he made a house

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.080
of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.560
of Levi. And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.040
the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah. And he offered upon the altar, so did

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.160
he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made. And he placed in Bethel

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.720
the priests of the high places which he had made. So he offered upon the altar which he

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.760
had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.560
devised of his own heart, and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel. And he offered

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:47.360
upon the altar, and burnt incense." Tragic. Tragic. We begin to think about what happens

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:54.400
here and we see the two places, one in Bethel, one in Dan. I stood in the place where the

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.440
altar was set up in Dan. They have excavated it, they know where it is, and literally a

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.200
couple of years ago when we were in Israel, we stood there. We stood in that place. It's

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.560
just sad. But I think about what happened back in the history as we read in Judges 18,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:16.200
where it's Dan that introduced that idol worship and they were given to idolatry. So now when

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:21.480
Jeroboam is going to set up these two idols, it just simply makes sense that one of them

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:28.000
will be in Dan. They're already okay with idol worship. We find that as the scriptures

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.000
tell us there in Genesis chapter 49 with regard to Dan and with regard specifically

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.480
to the serpent and the adder, "...and biteth the horse heel so that his rider shall fall

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.480
backward." Isn't that a sad situation, a sad commentary when you read what we just read

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.000
in 1 Kings chapter 12 and how they would set up a place and they would make offerings and

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.760
they would serve these idols? Idolatry is a serious thing. Idolatry, we find, has different

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:10.240
shapes and forms today than it did back in the biblical times. In fact, I would say this

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.120
tonight that idolatry in America looks different than idolatry in some other continents of

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.640
the world. There are some continents of the world where their idols are little figures

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:28.800
that they've made of wood and of stone and they worship them. Idols, you know, John says

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:36.560
in 1 John, little children, keep yourselves from idols. I would say simply this, that

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:43.560
an idol is truly anything that takes the place of God. It can be anything. It can be anything.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:49.640
It can be sports. It can be a job. It could be a child. It could be a spouse. It could

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.140
be, I mean, anything that takes place of God. See, here's what God says in His Word

00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:05.700
in Colossians 1, that in all things He, Christ, might have the preeminence, that He is first.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:14.160
By the way, we understand this evening that when Christ is first in our lives, that everything

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:20.360
else will work its way out. We'll be able to satisfy all of our responsibilities and

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:26.520
requirements and it's best, listen, in my home, in our home, in our family, it's best

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.640
for me to have God first and for Holly to have God first and then our marriage will

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.520
be what it's supposed to be. It's appropriate for me to have God first and Holly to have

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.880
God first and our children to have God first and then our home can work like it's supposed

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.680
to work. See, if I put Holly before God, if Holly puts me before God, all of a sudden

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:55.240
things don't work the way they're supposed to work. I ought to desire, listen, as a husband,

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.040
you ought to help your wife, especially if you have children at home, you ought to help

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:07.200
your wife have time with God because it's going to help your home. It's busy. I get

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.600
it. And so as a wife, helping your husband, he's got a job and responsibilities, the time

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:23.720
with God is important. We find this evening that idolatry there in Israel, introduced

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:29.480
by Dan. I believe it's very prophetic what we read in Genesis 49. It is of interest when

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.560
we think about Dan, some have noted and perhaps you've seen it before as well, that if you

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:41.880
look at Revelation chapter 7 and verses 1 through 8, Dan as a tribe is not mentioned.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:47.600
We find also that in 1 Chronicles chapters 2 through 10, there's a chronological order

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.560
that is given of the tribes, and you'll notice that in that portion of Scripture that Dan

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.200
also is missing from there. Now it's interesting if you understand the timeline of the book

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.120
of Revelation, and this isn't a lesson on the book of Revelation, but, but Revelation

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.880
chapter 7 is in the midst of the tribulation. All right? The rapture's already taken place.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.640
The church age as we know it has ceased to exist. We see that in Revelation 2 and 3 with

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.000
the church age. Chapter 4, I believe, is a picture of the rapture and the timing of the

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.880
rapture. And then you begin to see the throne room of heaven. You begin to start seeing

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.880
the judgments that are beginning to be poured out in chapter 6 and so on and so forth with

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.440
regard to the judgments. And we find in chapter number 7 of the book of Revelation, it's still

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:39.440
in the midst of the tribulation. So Dan is not mentioned in that portion of Scripture.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.200
Many people have sought to try to answer the question why that is. I don't know exactly.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.460
God doesn't tell us specifically. But it could possibly be that because of their introduction

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:56.280
of idolatry into the nation, that they're missing, they're absent in Revelation chapter

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:05.160
number 7. But I will say this, it's of note that in Ezekiel chapter 48, in verses 1 and

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:12.640
2, we find that Dan is included in the list of the tribes. And why is that interesting?

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:19.480
Well, because that's a prophetic view of the millennium. And I think that's of interest

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:26.720
because, again, when we look at Genesis chapter 49, we find that the process and all that's

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.800
taking place, the purpose of this whole scene that is given to us, but then the prophetic

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:38.960
view that there's a long view. God is a God that's outside of time. And we can see that

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.860
as we study the Scriptures, okay, well, Dan's not here and Dan's not here, but then Dan's

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.600
over here. And in Ezekiel 48, verses 1 and 2, in fact, you can look at Ezekiel. It's

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.200
very interesting, the lots of land that are given in the book of Ezekiel with regard to

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.720
the millennium, completely different than in Joshua's time with regard to where they

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:04.440
got their inheritance. I mean, completely different because that's millennium. And so

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:11.440
we find here this evening, then we look at Dan and we see this prophetic view that is

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:18.800
given. We're reminded this evening of the dangers of idolatry, the dangers of idolatry.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.440
Listen, it breaks my heart when I read things about the nation of Israel and Judah as well

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.440
of some of the wickedness that they did, the sacrificing of their children to Molech. You

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:37.120
say, how in the world? That was the pagan practice. How in the world would they be guilty?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.320
This is a slippery slope. They begin to put these idols and they begin to get involved

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.920
in idolatry and all that takes place. Listen, it's a dangerous thing. God must be first

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:52.460
in our lives. I wonder this evening as we begin to think about these tribes and begin

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:58.040
to think about the prophetic view here in Genesis 49 and wondering if they would take

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:05.680
and God would be prominent and preeminent in their lives, how it could change some things.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.960
See they can't get a redo and the fact of the matter is you and I don't get a redo either.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.160
I said this to someone last week. I was having a meeting with them and I said, listen, you

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:24.200
can't change yesterday, but you can have a reset today. You can determine today. All

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.360
of that stuff that happened, there's nothing you can do about it. You can't change it.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.520
You can be upset about it. You can be angry about it. You can, whatever all the emotions

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:38.480
are, but you're not going to change it. But you can have a reset today and you can determine

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:44.920
starting today, I'm going to serve God. He's going to have preeminence in my life. He's

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.160
going to be first place. It's amazing to me. Someone has asked us, actually lots of people

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.400
have asked over the years, what's the hardest part of pastoring? That's a hard question.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.360
There's a lot of different aspects, but you know one of the hardest things is people not

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.680
obeying God's Word, especially when you talk to them about it. It's hard. And people will

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.360
treat God like, here's the expression that I used, sometimes people treat God and the

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:20.600
church like a fire station. And here's why I use that analogy. How many of you call the

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:28.280
fire department on a weekly basis to see if it's still there? You don't. When do you call

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:35.920
the fire department? When you got an emergency, you got a fire, right? I've never called the

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.840
fire department, Brother Mark, and said, hey, I just wanted to find out if you guys still

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.880
have trucks. Do they have gas? Do you have water? Do you have hoses? Like, I just want

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.280
to make sure you're still operating. I've never made that. Have any of you ever made

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:53.760
that phone call? No. But if I have a fire and I call 911 and I call for the fire department,

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.160
I'm hoping that they're there and they're coming, right? That's not how we treat God

00:39:59.160 --> 00:39:59.920
and church.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.760
It's not just when my life is falling apart, oh, I need God, I need church.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.480
No, I need Him every moment of my life.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.200
And I must be careful that I learn lessons and say, look, don't go down the path of idolatry

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.960
that we see within Dan and the tribe and introducing it.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.080
No, we must make Christ preeminent in our lives.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.040
Gad is mentioned in verse 19.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.400
Of course, the Bible says in Genesis 49 and verse 19, Gad, a troop shall overcome him,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.360
but he shall overcome at the last.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.040
Again, not a whole lot given to us about Gad.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.960
We find that it says that a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:48.600
It says in Deuteronomy 33 and verse number 20 that it talks about his enlarging and his

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600
strength.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:55.220
And Moses says like a lion is really kind of the imagery that is given there with regard

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.880
to Gad.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.900
We do know of the tribe of Gad.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.380
Remember it was Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh that made the decision to

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.960
settle on the east side of Jordan.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.700
They saw the land, they saw that it was pleasant.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.660
They really made the request of Moses that they could settle there and they settled.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.260
And we see that it says a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:24.040
Settling there on the east side of Jordan would lead to being regularly attacked.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.820
And we can see of that, we can speak of that.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.240
I mentioned some of it last week with Reuben.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.240
But we find that it says here, but he shall overcome at the last.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.960
And again, I believe a view of prophetic view here with regard to Gad.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.500
There's not a whole lot that's given to us within the scriptures about the tribe of Gad.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.660
There are some that would like to give the idea that some great prophets, Elijah was

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.660
of the tribe of Gad.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.900
I don't know that you can truly prove that biblically.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.860
So you can be careful on some things that you read.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:03.180
I think there's some indication that that could potentially be the case.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:09.940
But we find that just because someone settled in the region doesn't mean they were necessarily

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:16.740
of the tribe of Gad because we know that Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh all settled

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.160
in that region.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.780
So it would not necessarily mean that everyone that's in that region is of the tribe of Gad.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.880
And so it's a little bit difficult to be able to understand some of the descendants

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.660
with regard to that situation.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.940
But we do trust that even as we've looked at some of these other blessings, that as

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:43.380
Jacob is speaking and he has this view of prophecy, that yes, it was the two-and-a-half

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.940
tribes that suffered regularly, undergoing attack, but we find that they were taken captive.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.900
They were the first that were taken captive by the Assyrians.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.060
We mentioned that last week as we looked at Reuben.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.400
But we find that it says, but he shall overcome at the last.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.340
And we just trust the Lord to all that that means.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.340
I don't know.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.140
And you say, well, pastor, how do you stand up there and say, I don't know?

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.380
Well, if you know, then you let me know because I don't know.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.340
And it's kind of the same thing I said last week in Sunday school.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.980
We looked at John chapter number five.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.460
I don't understand all the details of how it worked, but I just believe that what God

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.000
said is how it worked.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.160
And so that's not a problem.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.680
That's just how it is.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:29.640
And so God gives us this here in his word with regard to, but he shall overcome at the

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640
last.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.840
I think about that from this perspective quickly as application.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.720
Listen, the Bible says the just man falleth seven times, but what does he do?

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.240
He rises up again.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.920
And you know, the Bible talks about in the book of 1 John, we read it in the book of

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.960
Revelation as well as being overcomers.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.920
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.600
It's kind of similar to what I said that I mentioned to someone last week.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:44:00.080
Listen, you might have been kicked in the face, so to speak, by the enemy and you might

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:06.740
have fallen down, but get up again, be an overcomer, be a victor because greater is

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.640
he that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.200
And we are to be conquerors.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.520
We are to be overcomers.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.640
Yes, we have an adversary.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.280
We face opposition and difficulty.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.560
And though we might have been defeated yesterday or today, it doesn't mean that we need to

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.520
live in a constant state of defeat.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.520
Amen?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.520
We overcome.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.520
We conquer.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.720
We have been promised the victory.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.680
God tells us that we're to put on the whole armor of God and he tells us that we can stand

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.040
in these last days and, oh, how we need to stand and, oh, how we need to continue and

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.900
we need to be overcomers.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:52.400
And so we find this evening as we look at these four sons of Jacob, we find the importance

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.860
of thriving where God has you.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.360
God has a plan for your life, has a plan for my life, and as God would put us where he

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.120
wants us, that we determine that by his grace that we're gonna do what he's called us to

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:12.280
do and we are going to seek to please him and to be content with what he has for us

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.480
and then collectively and corporately we can fulfill what God's plan is for our lives.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.000
Be careful of idols.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.420
Keep yourselves from idols.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.120
We read that in the New Testament.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.520
And then be an overcomer.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.640
Don't allow the enemy to triumph in your life.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.520
He's a defeated foe.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520
I didn't say he's not.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.100
I mean, he's an active foe.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:36.640
He walketh about seeking whom he may devour, whom resist steadfast in the faith, amen?

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.940
And we find that we're to be sober, we're to be vigilant because we have that adversary,

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.460
but we're to be overcomers.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:49.220
We cannot allow ourselves to be defeated and just lay down and just live a life of defeat.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:54.060
How horrible that would be when the victory has been promised to us.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.500
We sing the song, Victory in Jesus, and what a wonderful song it is, and I'm thankful,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:05.980
as Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15, but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.500
the Lord Jesus Christ, amen?

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.500
And so what are we to do?

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:14.860
Well, we're to be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.900
that our labor, well, our labor's not in vain, amen?

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.420
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.420
Let's stand together.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.940
Father, we thank you for loving us.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.180
We thank you for your word.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:30.780
We thank you for the blessings of Jacob and how we can study your word and we can go through

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:36.700
and we can make application in our own lives, and God, I pray that you would help us tonight.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:42.740
I pray that you would help us to take heed, that we would take and apply the truth of

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:47.540
your word in our lives, that we might be conformed to the image of your dear Son, that we might

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.820
impact eternity with our lives.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.940
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:54.440
God bless you.
