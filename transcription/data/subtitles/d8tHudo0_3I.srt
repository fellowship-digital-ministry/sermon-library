1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Morning will be the text that we'll be preaching from and the title for the message as you see in the bulletin there the power of

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:13,279
The gospel. I'm so thankful that we have been entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ and we have the unique privilege

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,880
I shall say

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,059
Responsibility of sharing that precious message the good news of Jesus Christ

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,879
You'll be mindful of the fact that before the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross of Calvary in John chapter number 17 in verse

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,319
Number 18, he declared as thou hast sent me into the world

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,080
Even so have I also sent them

8
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:43,360
Into the world. We understand that the gospel has been given and we have been sent and we have a

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,680
Responsibility and Jesus made that declaration in John 17 before he would go to the cross of Calvary

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,479
Of course

11
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,520
We are mindful of the fact that after the resurrection of our Savior and before the ascension

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,900
we understand that he gave the Great Commission as we often refer to it as

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,519
You can read about the Great Commission and each of the Gospels again in the book of Acts

14
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,959
But you'll be mindful of the fact that he the Lord Jesus Christ

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:16,000
He said that we have been given this duty this job to preach the gospel to every creature

16
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,120
What a unique privilege and responsibility it is

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,720
we understand that as we read through the book of Acts that we have the

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,980
Privilege of being able to see the way in which the disciples

19
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,760
obeyed the declaration that Jesus gave and how the

20
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,199
obedience of the disciples

21
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:39,680
Resulted in the gospel going far and wide and many churches being established

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,760
You should read through the book of Acts. You'll find that there are two in my

23
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:52,080
Estimation just just amazing statements that are made in the book of Acts from those that opposed the gospel

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,160
These are not statements that were made by the leaders of the church

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,760
They're not made by the Apostles or one of the disciples

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
but we find that these are statements that are made by those that were in opposition those that were the

27
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:10,899
adversaries to the gospel going forth and really the statements that are made revealed to us the

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
obedience of the disciples and the

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,639
Work of Christ as we obey God and we do what he's told us to do

30
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,639
We see that he blesses beyond measure

31
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,520
the first of those statements is made in Acts 5 in verse 28 when those that are

32
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:29,559
Opposing the work of the ministry say this ye have filled

33
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,559
Jerusalem with your doctrine

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
that's a good thing, isn't it and

35
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:41,199
We have commanded you not to speak in his name yet. Ye have filled

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,160
Jerusalem with your doctrine. Oh that it would be said of us here in northern, Virginia

37
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:55,399
That we have filled this community this region of the state this part of our nation with the gospel of Jesus Christ

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
We find that later in Acts 17

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:04,919
When Paul and Silas would arrive to the city of Thessalonica that those in opposition said these

40
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,240
That have turned the world upside down

41
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,759
Are come hither

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,440
Also these that have turned the world upside down have come hither also that's Acts 17 in verse number 6

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,559
we find that

44
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,559
The gospel is powerful

45
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:28,559
we find that as you read through the journeys the missionary journeys as we'd often refer to them as in the book of Acts and you'll

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,199
find how that the

47
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:37,479
missionaries would arrive to a particular city a particular region you see how that the gospel preached change lives and

48
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,559
the power of the gospel those

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,960
That the cities that would be changed and transformed and just the the way in which the Lord would work mightily

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,800
I believe for us this morning that each and every one of us that we could stand

51
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:57,679
If we've been saved and we can stand and declare the power of the gospel in our own very lives

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,600
How he changed us what he's done in and through us as we look at Romans 1 in

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,559
Verses 14 through 16 this morning. We really are reading

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,360
the heart of the Apostle Paul as he's beginning to write to these believers in Rome and he shares with them some

55
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,440
important truth and I mentioned that our theme for our conference this year will begin on Saturday with the

56
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:27,600
Dinner and then Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday the theme of our conference is from Romans 1 16

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
I am NOT ashamed. I am NOT ashamed of the gospel

58
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:38,640
Why because Paul understood what the gospel is he understood that the gospel is powerful and as we look at this

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,799
Passage of Scripture. It is a familiar passage of Scripture

60
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:46,339
I want to make three observations this morning and I trust that as we consider these

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,880
Aspects of the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul that this morning we would be challenged

62
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,959
Through these verses notice in verse 14

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,279
Paul says this I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,660
Both to the wise and to the unwise

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:13,279
So as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also

66
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:19,760
For I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation

67
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:26,359
to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also

68
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,799
to the Greek as

69
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,480
We look at this passage of Scripture. I'd like for you to consider first of all

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,720
The perspective of the Apostle Paul as we look at verse number 14

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,279
We begin to see his perspective and as we would consider his perspective

72
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,279
We would understand that the phrase and we'll use one phrase from each verse as we look through our message this morning

73
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,200
We would see that his perspective is summarized in these three words in first number 14. I am

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Debtor I am debtor

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,079
You understand that as we would look at this passage of Scripture and understand that as Paul is writing to these believers in Rome

76
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,000
That he is sharing with them his personal responsibility

77
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:11,079
He has understood he has acknowledged and embraced the fact that he is

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,359
Personally accountable to God Almighty we find that as he would communicate these words and as he would say I am debtor

79
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:25,200
I want you to consider with me this morning. Really the the way in which these words would communicate the seriousness of Paul

80
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,839
He did not take this matter lightly

81
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:36,119
This this was not something that it was just a matter of convenience or if perhaps an opportunity would present itself

82
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:41,000
But you find that this perspective of the Apostle Paul when he says I am debtor

83
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:46,720
That as we look through the passage of Scripture and we consider the life and ministry of Paul as it's revealed to us

84
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,519
Throughout the Word of God

85
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,799
We find that it's this perspective that motivated him that allowed him to be used in the fashion in which he was

86
00:06:55,799 --> 00:07:03,079
I am debtor. I mean notice he's he's not even saying to those in Rome that you are indebted

87
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,760
He's saying of himself. He's taking the personal responsibility and he's taking it seriously

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,799
I am mindful even as I read this passage of Scripture and I think about the way in which the

89
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,399
Apostle Paul is revealing to us that he is indebted

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm mindful of what the angel said to those shepherds in Luke chapter number two. You'll be mindful that they were there

91
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,720
abiding in the field and those

92
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,959
Angels that appeared they say that I bring unto you right these glad tidings

93
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,880
But it says I bring unto you what shall be to all people

94
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
this wonderful

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,920
Proclamation that was given there in Luke 2 was not to just be given to the shepherds and held by the shepherds

96
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,959
But they were to go and proclaim

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,359
That message that Messiah was coming that he was born and we find this

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,559
This morning that as we look at this passage of Scripture that the gospel

99
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:05,480
the truth of the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ has been given to us and we are

100
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Indebted to give that truth to a lost and dying world

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,760
You'll notice that he uses the phrase in verse number 14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and

102
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
to the barbarians

103
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,440
This was a very common idiom that would be used in this particular time and really what he's communicating

104
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,480
Is that he is indebted to all people?

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Not just a certain group of people but to all people and we understand that as we've said many times over the years that

106
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,400
from the

107
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,119
Biblical perspective that we'd understand that there are simply two categories of people on this globe

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,359
There are people that have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

109
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,919
They are saved and heaven-bound and there are people that are lost in their sin

110
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,719
They are dead in their sins and their trespasses and the Bible says that the wage of sin is death

111
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,159
The Bible says death and hell will be cast like a fire

112
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,919
So we find it as we look at this passage of Scripture and we understand what Paul is saying

113
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,479
He's saying I have been entrusted with something that other people need

114
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,400
The gospel I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians

115
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:22,640
both to the wise and to the unwise as we consider the perspective of the Apostle Paul and

116
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,039
We notice the way in which he would use this terminology to communicate to us

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,640
By way of preservation the seriousness. I wonder this morning

118
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,159
How often do we take this matter as serious as Paul took it?

119
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:43,919
I wonder this morning how often how many of us would ever look at ourselves as being a debtor as being

120
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,760
Indebted to give this message to a lost and dying world

121
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,919
We find that as Paul would often communicate to those that he was ministering to I want you to look at what he says to

122
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,880
The believers in Corinth turn over if you will to the first Corinthians 9

123
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
And I want you to look at what Paul says

124
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,220
with regard to this responsibility that he had.

125
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,140
As we consider the responsibility,

126
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,640
and this is his perspective,

127
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,980
you will find why it was that Paul

128
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,520
went from city to city,

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,060
and as the Scriptures will say,

130
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,600
as his manner was,

131
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,860
he would enter into a city

132
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,760
and begin to preach the Gospel.

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,500
It's a perspective that we need.

134
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,280
It's a perspective that I need.

135
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
That we would have this perspective

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,260
that I am dead here.

137
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,900
Notice 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 16.

138
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,240
For though I preach the Gospel,

139
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,760
I have nothing to glory of,

140
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,660
for necessity is laid upon me.

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,960
Yea, woe is unto me

142
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,420
if I preach not the Gospel.

143
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,860
Notice in verse 23.

144
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,500
And this I do for the Gospel's sake,

145
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,340
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

146
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,220
Begin to see that Paul says,

147
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,260
woe is unto me there in verse 16,

148
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,540
if I preach not the Gospel.

149
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,660
I wonder how often we go through our lives,

150
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,820
and I wonder if perhaps there's a period,

151
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,400
a season of time in our lives

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
where maybe there's a few days

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,620
or maybe even a few weeks

154
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,940
that would pass by,

155
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
and we've not had the privilege

156
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,300
of sharing the Gospel with someone.

157
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,380
I wonder if we'd say like Jeremiah

158
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,180
that it's just bubbling in me.

159
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,900
It's like a fire within me.

160
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,380
I just can't wait to give the Gospel

161
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,540
to someone, anyone that would listen,

162
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,140
because I understand the truth

163
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,780
and the power of this wonderful message.

164
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,700
And Paul says, woe is unto me

165
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,420
if I preach not the Gospel.

166
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,780
He said I am debtor.

167
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,460
And I just wonder if we can in our minds

168
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,340
remember the last time we were able

169
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,060
to share the Gospel with someone.

170
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,140
I wonder if you can go to that place

171
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,820
in your mind and you can say,

172
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,020
I remember the last time I was able

173
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,460
to share the Gospel with someone,

174
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,100
and maybe they trusted Christ,

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,500
maybe they weren't interested,

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,740
but you remember that last time

177
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,500
you were able to speak of Christ

178
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,540
and speak of the good news of the Gospel.

179
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,100
Can I tell you this morning,

180
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,660
if that memory is way, way, way back somewhere,

181
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,340
I hope this morning that we'd have

182
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,860
that fire rekindled.

183
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,660
And we'd say, man, I just want to find someone

184
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
to give the Gospel to,

185
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,060
because I'm indebted.

186
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,900
I am debtor.

187
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,100
Notice what he says in 2 Corinthians 4.

188
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,340
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4,

189
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,340
Paul says to these same believers in Corinth

190
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,180
in the same city,

191
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,020
this now second letter that he writes

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,340
in verse number three of this chapter,

193
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
we find that Paul says this,

194
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,100
if our Gospel be hid,

195
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,700
it is hid to them that are lost.

196
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,340
We obviously understand this morning

197
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,340
that those are the people that need the Gospel.

198
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,580
Those that are lost.

199
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,540
They need it.

200
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,860
We're indebted to them.

201
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
And Paul says if our Gospel be hid,

202
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
it is hid to them that are lost.

203
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,220
Notice what he says in verse number seven,

204
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,460
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels

205
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,260
that the excellency of the power

206
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,740
may be of God and not of us.

207
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,300
I notice the way in which he says

208
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,060
we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

209
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,020
We're but clay.

210
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,020
I mean, we're really nothing

211
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,740
except for the fact that we've been made

212
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,860
in the image of God Almighty

213
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,780
and the fact that God Almighty

214
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,500
came and died for us

215
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,020
so that we could be redeemed

216
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
and what a wonderful privilege,

217
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,460
but we have this treasure,

218
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,620
the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

219
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,820
Paul, in between the two verses

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,660
that we've read here in 2 Corinthians 4

221
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,260
and verse three and verse number seven,

222
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
we find that he mentions

223
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,820
about the work of the enemy

224
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,380
to keep blinded the minds of those

225
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,540
that have not received the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

226
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,020
And we understand that the enemy is alive

227
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,940
and active and he's working.

228
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,300
This morning, as Paul says here in verse number five,

229
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,500
we preach not ourselves,

230
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,060
but Christ Jesus the Lord

231
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,100
and ourselves your servants for Jesus's sake.

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
We don't preach ourselves.

233
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,460
I often say to individuals

234
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,140
as I have the privilege of sharing the Gospel with them,

235
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,660
I'm not asking you to come to our church.

236
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,460
I'm not asking you to give to our church.

237
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,860
I'm not asking you to do any.

238
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,180
I'm just trying to share with you the truth

239
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,220
of what Jesus Christ did for you

240
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,020
because one day you're going to die.

241
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,740
Are you ready?

242
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,060
Are you ready?

243
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,300
See, I am dead hurt.

244
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,500
Notice what he says in 1 Thessalonians 2.

245
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,140
We'll move on to verse number 15 in Romans 1 here,

246
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,580
but look at what he says here

247
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,500
in 1 Thessalonians 2.

248
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,020
I made the statement by way of introduction this morning

249
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,060
that second statement that's made in the book of Acts

250
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,580
that's so impactful was in Acts 17 in verse six

251
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,540
when Paul and Silas arrived at the city of Thessalonica

252
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,220
and now he's writing this epistle back to these believers.

253
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,700
And I want you to notice what he says

254
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,140
in 1 Thessalonians 2 in verse number four.

255
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,940
And I believe that this will continue

256
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,100
to help us understand this perspective of Paul.

257
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,620
Notice what he says.

258
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,140
But as we were allowed of God,

259
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,980
notice what he says,

260
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,500
to be put in trust with the gospel.

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,180
Even so we speak, not as pleasing men,

262
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,540
but God which trieth our hearts.

263
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,740
I notice a few things here from verse number four

264
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
of 1 Thessalonians 2.

265
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,860
Number one, I understand that it's a privilege.

266
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,460
He says we are allowed of God.

267
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,900
Isn't it amazing that God would allow us

268
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,620
to be his spokespeople, to be his messengers.

269
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,580
In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul says that we are ambassadors.

270
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,380
And you think about that unique privilege

271
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,260
and opportunity that is ours.

272
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,620
And here Paul says that we were allowed of God.

273
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,220
And then notice that phrase,

274
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,540
to be put in trust with the gospel.

275
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,980
He says it this way in 1 Thessalonians

276
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,400
that we were entrusted to be put in trust with the gospel.

277
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,640
In Romans one, I am debtor.

278
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,920
Why did he recognize himself as being a debtor?

279
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Because he had been entrusted with something.

280
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
And that something that he had been entrusted with

281
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,200
changed his life,

282
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,560
but it was something that he had to give to others.

283
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,680
So as Romans one, in verse 14,

284
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,720
we first consider the perspective of the apostle Paul

285
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,000
when he says I am debtor.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,520
Number two, in Romans one, look at verse number 15.

287
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,000
Not only do we consider his perspective,

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,600
but I consider his preparation.

289
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,000
Consider the preparation of the apostle Paul.

290
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,880
Notice what he says.

291
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,540
So as much as in me is,

292
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,820
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

293
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,840
that are at Rome also.

294
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
We use the phrase from verse number 14

295
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
with regard to the perspective of Paul.

296
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
I am debtor.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,040
We'll use the phrase from verse number 15

298
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,560
with regard to his preparation.

299
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,840
I am ready.

300
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,500
I am ready.

301
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,100
And we think about the apostle Paul,

302
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
what he's saying here.

303
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,420
So as much as in me is,

304
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,260
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

305
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,480
that are at Rome also.

306
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,620
When that opportunity presents itself,

307
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,460
are you ready?

308
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,540
Have you prepared?

309
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,140
Have you understood this perspective

310
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,340
that would then lead to this process of preparation?

311
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,100
See, we understand that as Paul

312
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,740
would have the perspective that I am debtor,

313
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,700
that I have been entrusted,

314
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,300
therefore we prepare.

315
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,420
We want to be ready to give the gospel

316
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,700
to those that we would come into contact with.

317
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,420
Perhaps there's been a time in your life

318
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,820
in which you have had a conversation

319
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,420
and you've left that conversation

320
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,180
and you've kind of said something like this,

321
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,180
man, I wasn't really ready to give the gospel

322
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,700
in that particular setting.

323
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,540
I wasn't mindful of it.

324
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,940
And maybe as you walked away

325
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,980
from that particular interaction that you had,

326
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,180
you said, man, I wish that I had handled

327
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,380
that conversation differently.

328
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,620
I wish I would have taken that conversation

329
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,180
more towards the gospel

330
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,740
and being able to present truth to that individual.

331
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,140
We, as we look at the perspective of Paul,

332
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,340
we then understand the preparation.

333
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,980
I wonder this morning,

334
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,220
as we would engage in conversation

335
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,340
that we come into contact with individuals

336
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,500
and we engage in conversation with them,

337
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,980
I wonder if we're ready to figure out

338
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,020
in those conversations how we make a beeline to the gospel.

339
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,100
We can talk for a long time about things

340
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,380
that really don't matter.

341
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,500
Right?

342
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,299
I mean, you talk to people

343
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,380
and they want to talk about the weather.

344
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,500
They want to talk about sports.

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,780
They want to talk about COVID

346
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,580
and they want to talk about all kinds of things.

347
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,619
I shared briefly a testimony on Wednesday evening

348
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,900
about an individual that I had contact with on Tuesday.

349
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,940
As I was speaking with them,

350
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,340
they were, what did they want to talk about?

351
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,859
They want to talk about the gas crisis

352
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,859
because that was the thing that was going on

353
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,059
that particular day on Tuesday, right?

354
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,660
And that was what they wanted to talk about.

355
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
And then it just went from the gas crisis

356
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,619
to you just name it, it was a free for all.

357
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,220
And as I stood there and listened to that individual

358
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,100
for that duration of just a few minutes,

359
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,580
my mind was thinking, how do I get to the gospel?

360
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,619
How do I get to the gospel?

361
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,299
How do I get to the gospel?

362
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,100
And as he paused just long enough,

363
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,179
I was able to share with him truth

364
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,940
from Hebrews chapter number two.

365
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,140
And then went over to the truth

366
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,100
in the book of Revelations,

367
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,380
begin to share truth and try to take the conversation

368
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,820
to biblical matters, to the truth of the gospel.

369
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,299
Listen, there's all kinds of things

370
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,340
going on in our world today.

371
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,220
There's all kinds of opportunities for us

372
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,100
to talk about the way in which we find

373
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,100
some of these prophetical things in the word of God.

374
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,740
that are lining up and the way in which we see these things progressing and oh we

375
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,740
have opportunity. The question is are we ready? When I think about this term I am

376
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,140
ready, I think about someone that has entered into, they're mindful of,

377
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,820
and they're saying I am ready to preach the gospel. I'm ready, I'm prepared, I'm

378
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:29,020
mindful of it. I have prepared. The preparation of the Apostle Paul, I want

379
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,420
you to think about what he says in Galatians chapter number one. You'll be

380
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,220
mindful of the fact that Paul was converted and it's recorded for us in

381
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:48,180
Acts chapter number nine on the road to Damascus. His name was Saul at that time

382
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,620
and we find that after the first missionary journey which is recorded for

383
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:59,940
us in Acts 13 through 15. This is in the region of Galatia and he's now

384
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,500
writing back to those churches here in this book, but I want you to notice what

385
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,340
he says in verses 11 and 12 with regard to this thought of preparation. He says

386
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,620
this, but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not

387
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:22,860
after man. For I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the

388
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,940
revelation of Jesus Christ. Look over if you will skip down to verse number 18

389
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,140
and notice that he says then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see

390
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:41,500
Peter and abode with him 15 days. During that period of time Paul was going

391
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,420
through some preparation. He was being instructed it says by the revelation of

392
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,020
Jesus Christ in verse number 12 and there's not a whole lot that we know

393
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,700
about that period of time in Paul's life, but we understand that there was this

394
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,820
process of preparation. You understand that as he would write to those that

395
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,300
he's ministering to over the years and as God would use them to write scripture

396
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,740
that often he will say to those individuals that he's writing to and

397
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,060
he's ministering to I say unto you by the Word of the Lord and he's giving

398
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,900
them the truth of God's Word. We find that even as he would deliver to these

399
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,060
individuals in Corinth the gospel that he helps them to understand that it's

400
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,540
the gospel of Jesus Christ what had been given to him he's then delivering to

401
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:34,380
others. I've been asked many times over the years what is it that you believe as

402
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,180
a Baptist? What is it that makes you different then? And they'll just start

403
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:44,700
listing some other denomination or group and I want them to understand that we're

404
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:52,740
seeking to follow the Bible. As a Baptist our number one if you will just a

405
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,900
statement that we seek to make with regard to our distinction is that the

406
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:03,420
Bible the Word of God is the sole authority for faith and practice. It's

407
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,780
something that we just kind of some traditions that we just follow like in a

408
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,540
in a wrong manner but we're seeking to follow the Word of God. What sayeth the

409
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:20,660
Lord? And if we're going to give truth if we're going to be ready to give the

410
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,780
gospel as Paul says in Romans 1 and verse number 15 we we have to have some

411
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,340
preparation. How is it that I'm going to give the gospel? What answer am I going

412
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,500
to give to someone when that opportunity presents itself? I'm mindful

413
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,060
of Ezra in the Old Testament in Ezra 7 and verse number 10 if you want to

414
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,980
jot that reference down but Ezra says in that passage of Scripture that he

415
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:54,420
prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in

416
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:02,500
Israel statutes and judgments. What a powerful verse of Scripture. Ezra he says

417
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,500
that he he was prepared as we would see that he understood that he sought the

418
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,620
law of the Lord to do it and then to teach in Israel statutes and judgments

419
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,900
the time of his preparation preceded the opportunity that was afforded him. We

420
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,660
find that if you were to read throughout Ezra 7 that's verse number 10 if you

421
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,300
read the remainder of chapter 7 and really get into chapter number 8 you see

422
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,260
that opportunities are given to Ezra because of the preparation that he's

423
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,460
already gone through. This morning as we think about these statements from

424
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,220
Romans chapter number 1 I believe that if we have that proper perspective in

425
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,380
verse 14 that I am dead or that it will lead us to that proper preparation of

426
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,460
being able to say I am ready and then as we have prepared I believe that God

427
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,140
will give us opportunities that he will present us with those opportunities. Why?

428
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,540
Well if we take these two thoughts in connection this morning then we are

429
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,260
mindful and we are looking for the opportunities because we have understood

430
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,860
the perspective that I am dead or and we've gone through the preparation I am

431
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,260
ready and therefore we are now looking for those opportunities. There are simple

432
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,860
statements that you can make to people that cause them to stop in their tracks

433
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,460
and inquire as to what you mean. I met a guy when I was in Bible college that

434
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,500
every time you asked him he wasn't in Bible college he was a preacher that

435
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,380
came through he preached a revival meeting at the college I think a couple

436
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,020
of the years that I was there and anytime you asked him how he was doing

437
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:45,020
he said better than I deserve. Why did he use that phraseology? Because countless

438
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,700
times he had the opportunity with saying to someone better than I deserve they

439
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,540
say what do you mean by that and then he had the privilege of being able to

440
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,940
right then right now go into sharing the gospel. Because when's the last time you

441
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,780
introduced yourself to someone or asked someone how they were doing and they

442
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,340
told you better than I deserve. It's not common it's not regular right and so

443
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,980
when you hear something that's out of the ordinary something that you're not

444
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,620
expecting it causes you to stop and say what do you mean by that? I told you the

445
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,660
story about the man at the bank when I said I was absolutely wonderful he says

446
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,180
you're lying nobody's wonderful huh I said you ain't met mr. Don yet because

447
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,140
he's been in the hospital bed and he's absolutely wonderful amen but he told me

448
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,900
I was lying that's what he told me I promise you

449
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,660
I was in Wells Fargo right over here on Germantown he said you're lying nobody's

450
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:47,380
wonderful I said well I'm going to heaven man I am wonderful and then he

451
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,020
got all kinds of sideways he's like are you dying I don't think so but one day

452
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm going to amen and so are you what I'm suggesting to you this morning is

453
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,820
that I'm not perfect at it there are more times when I fail than I'm doing

454
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,180
what I'm supposed to do but that were mindful that were purposed and

455
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,700
understanding I am indebted I have been given the gospel of Jesus Christ it's

456
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,940
changed my life and now I have been entrusted with I better be ready to give

457
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,860
it notice in verse number 16 back in Romans 1 we consider the perspective of

458
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,580
the Apostle Paul we consider the preparation of the Apostle Paul and now

459
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,820
I want you to consider the passion of the Apostle Paul in Romans 1 in verse

460
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:48,700
16 he says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of

461
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,820
God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to

462
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:03,260
the Greek perhaps this morning you've not yet recognized this but I would

463
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,620
submit to you and I believe it to be the case that we're currently living in a

464
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,980
society in which they want you to be ashamed of believing the gospel they

465
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,900
don't want you to go talking about what you believe they want you to be ashamed

466
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,220
of the gospel of Jesus Christ that's the society that we're currently living in

467
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,060
but Paul says I'm not ashamed I am not ashamed as you study the New Testament

468
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,380
you'll find that Paul had a passion to reach people with the gospel of Jesus

469
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,020
Christ he understood what was at stake and he personally embraced the

470
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:45,420
responsibility we use the the phrases in verse 14 I am debtor in verse 15 I am

471
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:52,580
ready here I am not ashamed Paul as he would speak about in this very book the

472
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:59,300
book of Romans when he would speak about his brethren other Jewish individuals he

473
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,900
would speak about the way in which he had heaviness and continual sorrow in

474
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,580
his heart in chapter 9 and chapter 10 he would reveal his heart's desire in

475
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,380
prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved you see a man that that

476
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,780
that was passionate about reaching people with the gospel of Jesus Christ

477
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,100
we find that this morning it's absolutely possible for us to have

478
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,740
passion in a variety of ways we find that there are people that we come into

479
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,380
contact with every day of our lives that are passionate about something whatever

480
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,260
that something is if you get them on the subject that they're most passionate

481
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,900
about they can talk about it and talk about it and talk about it some more you

482
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,340
know what I mean there are people that are passionate I just wonder this

483
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:54,700
morning do we have this same perspective and would we have that level of passion

484
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,620
to be able to say I am NOT ashamed of the gospel of Christ

485
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,660
Again, the society wants us, why does the society want you to be ashamed of it?

486
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,180
Because there's a spiritual war that's going on.

487
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,340
I hear more and more and more from folks all around in different periodicals that I receive

488
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,820
and different emails that come across my desk of people that want to talk about the cultural

489
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
war that we're engaged in.

490
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,900
And I submit to you, as I did a couple of years ago in preaching through the book of

491
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,780
Ephesians, that it is so much more than a cultural war, it is a spiritual war.

492
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,300
We're engaged in spiritual warfare.

493
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,980
And what happens at times in our lives is that we come into the place where we cower

494
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,540
in fear of sharing the gospel with someone because we're afraid of what they're going

495
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,020
to think or say.

496
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:51,060
And we're fearful and therefore we do not give the truth of the gospel.

497
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,380
We shy away from it.

498
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,580
We cower in fear and we find that this is happening at increased levels.

499
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,620
I'm going to share some things with you this evening.

500
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,660
I'm going to preach from the book of Jude and I'm going to look at a few things that

501
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,780
I hope would challenge us to have this proper perspective.

502
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,740
I understand that some won't be back this evening and so I'm going to read this tonight

503
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,420
so those that come back you'll hear it again.

504
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,940
But this is something that someone said with regard to acknowledging some of the great

505
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,020
hymns of the faith that we sing that were written many years ago in a generation that's

506
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,540
gone now and we find that they made this observation in mentioning about some of these

507
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,900
hymns that were made and here's what they say, in days when reaching the lost seemed

508
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,860
to be more of a priority for most believers.

509
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,100
I read that first statement, I'm going to read the whole thing to you this evening,

510
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,580
but I read the first statement, I highlighted it in yellow and it just crushed me as I read

511
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,980
it.

512
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:00,380
In days when reaching the lost seemed to be more of a priority for most believers.

513
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,100
Why isn't it a priority for us today?

514
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,140
What else has become a priority for us today?

515
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,380
And we've kind of not had that passion and we find that Paul had a passion.

516
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,020
He said, I am not ashamed.

517
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,740
We find that Paul, listen, he had his encounters with those that opposed the message that he

518
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
preached.

519
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
Amen?

520
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,620
There was opposition at every level and we find that there were times in which, and you

521
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,780
look at the first missionary journey, every city that they went into and they preached

522
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,700
the gospel and people got saved, they got ran out of.

523
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,940
Because there's opposition.

524
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,100
But Paul still says, near the end of his life, I am not ashamed.

525
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,600
Why?

526
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,620
Because I understand what the gospel is.

527
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:53,540
I understand that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

528
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,620
To everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

529
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,380
See, I mentioned this a moment ago, that Paul had an understanding of what was at stake.

530
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,460
Do you recognize this morning that each person that you come into contact with, whether that

531
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,320
be a coworker tomorrow, a neighbor this afternoon, someone at the restaurant in which you'll

532
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,320
have lunch this afternoon, every person that you come into contact with is going to die

533
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,960
and they're going to go to either heaven or the lake of fire.

534
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,720
That's just the reality.

535
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,040
And we find that he understood what was at stake.

536
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,400
These people aren't going to believe me.

537
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,640
These people are going to oppose me.

538
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,920
Well, at least I gave them the truth.

539
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,460
And I can stand before God and say, I told them, I did what I was commanded to do.

540
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:53,360
Look at Acts 17, if you will, as we think about this passion of Paul.

541
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,000
We've noticed his perspective, we've noticed his preparation, and now as we consider this

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,160
passion of his, we find in Acts 17, this is when they arrive in Thessalonica, according

543
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,200
to verse number one, notice in verse two, and Paul, look at these words, as his manner

544
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:20,720
was, went in unto them in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

545
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,960
We find that in verse number two, the Bible tells us as his manner was, this was the manner

546
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
of Paul.

547
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
This was his behavior.

548
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
This is what he did.

549
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
He comes into a city.

550
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,320
He's seeking to preach the gospel, to give the truth, as his manner was.

551
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,720
Notice what it says in verse 16.

552
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,920
Now you'll understand if we understand kind of what's going on here, the people that had

553
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,240
troubled in other cities had now come to Thessalonica, and so they have Paul, they sent him out,

554
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,840
and in verse number 16, the Bible says, now while Paul waited for them in Athens, his

555
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,200
spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

556
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,400
We find that Paul, really, if we were to understand what's taking place, and without

557
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,560
having time to go through all of it this morning here in Acts 17, that they send Paul out ahead,

558
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,880
and they're going to basically get a little R&R, if you will, because of all that has

559
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
been encountered, and yet we find that when Paul is there, and he's waiting for them,

560
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,840
he's at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him.

561
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,120
Here's something that I've learned in my own life, and perhaps you can relate to this as

562
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:32,400
well, is that it's possible for us to be stirred up and do nothing about it.

563
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
It's possible.

564
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,840
Oh, that God would stir us, and it would bring forth some action.

565
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,520
No matter how small that action is, we've got to start somewhere, amen?

566
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,560
Maybe this morning, your prayer, because you can't remember the last time you shared the

567
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,560
gospel with an individual, as I mentioned earlier in the message, maybe the prayer this

568
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,520
morning of someone is, God, in the next 30 days, would you help me to share the gospel

569
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,240
with someone?

570
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,880
Maybe someone's prayer this morning is, God, would you help me in this process of preparation?

571
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm not even sure how to take the conversation into the gospel.

572
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Whatever it is, we start somewhere, because being stirred is a good thing, but that stirring

573
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,680
needs to bring forth some action in our lives, and some change in our lives, and we find

574
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,560
that here, the Bible says that he was stirred in his spirit, that his spirit was stirred

575
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,360
in him, and then notice verse 17, therefore, because of the stirring, what was it that

576
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,040
caused Paul to be stirred?

577
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:42,800
He saw a city that was wholly, entirely, completely given to idolatry, and his spirit is stirred

578
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,480
within him, and it says, therefore, because of what he saw, because of how he was stirred,

579
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,200
therefore, disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and

580
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,400
in the market daily with them that met with him.

581
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
What's Paul do?

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,840
Enough with the R&R, there's work to be done, amen?

583
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,320
I'm not suggesting that we don't ever need rest.

584
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,920
Jesus says, come apart and rest, amen, and we understand that there's a need for that,

585
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,320
but you look at Paul, and you see how he's stirred, and how he is brought to action.

586
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,200
He disputes with them.

587
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,800
Notice it says that, there in verse number 18, then certain philosophers of the Epicureans

588
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,120
and of the Stoics encountered him, and some said, what will this babbler say?

589
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,400
You know, some are going to call you a babbler, that's okay.

590
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,600
You know what Jesus said, newsflash, if they hate you, they hated me.

591
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Isn't that what Jesus said, John 15?

592
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,800
You go and look at it, that's what Jesus said.

593
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,340
They say, what will this babbler say?

594
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:51,380
You know that there were people that encountered and went to where Jesus was teaching just

595
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,940
to criticize him?

596
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,180
That was the only reason why they went.

597
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,260
I'm reading through the Gospels right now, my personal Bible time, and as I'm reading

598
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,940
through the Gospels again, and I'm reading, I just finished Mark this morning, and as

599
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm reading through the Gospels again, and I'm reading, and I'm just mindful, hey listen,

600
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,180
sometimes they just come to criticize him.

601
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,700
You know, that helps me when I get criticism.

602
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,220
There's some people that watch on that camera, on the other side there's a computer, and

603
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,900
they only watch to criticize.

604
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,300
It's just the way it is, and that's okay.

605
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,100
But what I'm saying this morning is that they might say, this babbler, don't worry about

606
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,500
that, just give the Gospel.

607
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,540
Notice what they say, he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods, because he preached

608
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,820
unto them Jesus and the resurrection.

609
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
What's he preaching?

610
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,420
The Gospel.

611
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,500
The Gospel.

612
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:49,060
In verse number 23, he says this, as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar

613
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,140
with this inscription to the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him

614
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,340
declare I unto you.

615
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,820
You know, we live in the midst of a lost and dying world.

616
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,020
We live in the midst of a people that are going to spend eternity somewhere, and there's

617
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,540
only two options.

618
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:20,100
I know that there are other groups of people that teach other things, but when you go to

619
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:30,020
the Word of God, you find that there's but two destinations, heaven and the lake of fire.

620
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:37,000
Because it is appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment.

621
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,100
We find this morning that we need to understand what's at stake, and when we understand what's

622
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:47,140
at stake, it will impact our passion, and Paul, he's passionate and he's going.

623
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,940
In chapter number 18, when they get to Corinth, in verse number 4, it says this, and he reasoned

624
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,900
in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks, and what's he doing?

625
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,340
He's giving the Gospel.

626
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,420
It says that they opposed themselves and blasphemed and all these sorts of things

627
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,660
are happening but you find that the Lord Jesus Christ comes and encourages him.

628
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,740
Notice what it says in verse 9, then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by

629
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:18,540
a vision, be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace. For I am with thee

630
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,380
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city.

631
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,360
You know what Jesus said when he gave the Great Commission as it's recorded in

632
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:38,200
Matthew chapter 28? The last words in lo I am with you always, right? He's with us

633
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,800
and Paul receives encouragement because of this opposition and Corinth he goes

634
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,080
and he's preaching the gospel and God says the Lord says be not afraid but

635
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:58,080
speak and hold not thy peace. Be not afraid and speak. He says I am with thee.

636
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,200
What a precious promise of the Word of God. Turn over another couple of pages if

637
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,240
you will and look at Acts 20. I want you to notice what Paul says here in Acts 20. He's

638
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:16,980
here speaking to the leaders of the church at Ephesus. We think about the

639
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,100
passion of Paul to give the truth of the gospel. Notice what he says in verse

640
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,380
20 and 21. And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have

641
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,340
showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both

642
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,300
to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward

643
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,700
our Lord Jesus Christ. Skip down in verse number 31 if you will. Therefore watch

644
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,980
and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone of

645
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:54,980
everyone night and day with tears. Paul says I kept back nothing that was

646
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,540
profitable unto you. He says that he was testifying both to the Jews and also to

647
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,940
the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. He

648
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:12,140
says that he did it with tears. He had a level of passion to just reach someone

649
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:21,060
with the gospel. And I believe this morning as we think about this portion

650
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,060
of scripture a familiar passage Romans 1 14 through 16. We notice these

651
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,420
statements and we are able to consider the perspective and the preparation and

652
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:37,060
the passion. I wonder this morning do we have a passion to reach people with the

653
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:45,940
gospel? The songwriter said we sing the song give me a passion for souls dear

654
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:54,180
Lord. A passion to reach the lost. What a wonderful hymn that is. And I just

655
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,980
wonder this morning what is it that we are passionate about? What is it that

656
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,980
if someone were to be asked, maybe a co-worker, maybe a friend, a neighbor,

657
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:12,540
maybe a family member, what is so-and-so passionate about? What would they say?

658
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:20,060
Would souls even be on the list anywhere as to what we're passionate about? Give

659
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,580
me a passion for souls. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the

660
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,820
power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also

661
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:36,660
to the Greek. As we draw closer to the Lord I believe that he will develop in

662
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:43,580
us a passion for souls as we draw closer to him. See because as we draw closer to

663
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,700
our Lord, as we walk with him as we're supposed to, we find that we'll begin to

664
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:56,820
love what he loves. Amen? Listen, before I was saved I didn't love the Bible. Before

665
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,780
I was saved I didn't love church. Before I was saved I didn't love the brethren.

666
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:07,220
Before I was saved I wouldn't give my money to a church or to missions. But as

667
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:12,660
we get saved and then as we walk with the Lord and as we draw closer to him we

668
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:23,620
begin to love what he loves. Jesus said this in Matthew 4, follow me and I will

669
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:31,860
make you fishers of men. They were fishers of fish. I am not a fisherman.

670
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,300
I've never been accused of being one. In fact, Joseph, I think it was their

671
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,620
basketball team, maybe it was a class, I can't remember where he was, he was the

672
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,060
only kid that his dad had not taken him fishing. I felt bad. I felt horrible. I

673
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:53,780
don't even have a fishing rod. I just, I don't know. I need to go to one of those

674
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,700
stocked ponds, you know what I mean? Where it's just easy. But the reality is that

675
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:06,460
these guys were fishers of fish. It's what they did. And Jesus said follow me

676
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:17,040
and I will make you fishers of men. The closer we get to the Lord the more we're

677
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,160
gonna love what he loves. And God so loved the world that he gave his only

678
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:31,280
begotten Son. Aren't you thankful for that love? The Bible says that he

679
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,080
commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.

680
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:43,240
We've been the recipients but now we've been entrusted with something. And my

681
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,160
prayer, not only through the preaching today, I'm gonna preach another message

682
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:53,680
tonight on this same topic and really thinking about missions and next week as

683
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,680
we have our missions conference, anticipate hearing messages about

684
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,560
reaching the lost, reaching the world. My prayer for me and for each of you is that

685
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,760
God would not only stir us up but he would change us. That we would be changed

686
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,440
not just emotionally stirred but that we would be changed and that we would get

687
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,360
this same perspective that Paul had that would lead to a level of preparation and

688
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,280
give us a passion to reach people with the gospel. Listen, I believe we sang the

689
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,080
song Jesus is Coming Again. Some of you probably heard it says maybe morning,

690
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,920
maybe noon, maybe evening. The songwriter said maybe soon. I always say will be

691
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:48,600
soon. I think Jesus is coming back soon and I'm looking forward to it. Our time is

692
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:55,440
short. Amen? We have a work to do. May the Lord use us for his honor, for his glory.

693
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,160
Father we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the

694
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:08,200
opportunity of looking at this passage of Scripture. I know it's familiar. I

695
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,560
pray God that you would help us to have a proper perspective. That we'd

696
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,040
understand that we are debtors. That we have been entrusted with the gospel of

697
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:28,080
Jesus Christ and that lost men need that message. Would you help us to prepare?

698
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:35,600
Would you help us to be mindful of taking those conversations and turning them to

699
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,960
spiritual matters? So that we might have the privilege of sharing the gospel with

700
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,600
those that we come into contact with. Oh in a day and age in which the hostilities

701
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,400
and the opposition seems to increase daily, I pray that you'd help us to not

702
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:01,240
be ashamed. Help us to be passionate. I pray God that you would not only stir

703
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,080
us this morning, but I pray that you'd change us. Help us to leave this place

704
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,080
understanding that we're entering into the mission field. I'm thankful for the

705
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,440
missionaries that we send across the seas, but you've caught us to simply go

706
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:24,480
across the street to our neighbors, our co-workers, our family, friends. Lord would

707
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,320
you use us for your glory. Would you help us to be mindful of the power of

708
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,680
the gospel. I pray that you'd move and work as only you can. For it's in Christ's

709
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,600
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

710
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:45,280
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. As she does, would you allow the

711
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,800
Lord to have his will and way in your life? Perhaps you want to use your pew as

712
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,800
an altar. Perhaps you want to come to this old-fashioned altar. But as Kimberly

713
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,600
plays, we invite you to respond to the message this morning.
