00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
Morning will be the text that we'll be preaching from and the title for the message as you see in the bulletin there the power of

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:13.279
The gospel. I'm so thankful that we have been entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ and we have the unique privilege

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.880
I shall say

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.059
Responsibility of sharing that precious message the good news of Jesus Christ

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.879
You'll be mindful of the fact that before the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross of Calvary in John chapter number 17 in verse

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.319
Number 18, he declared as thou hast sent me into the world

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.080
Even so have I also sent them

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:43.360
Into the world. We understand that the gospel has been given and we have been sent and we have a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.680
Responsibility and Jesus made that declaration in John 17 before he would go to the cross of Calvary

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.479
Of course

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.520
We are mindful of the fact that after the resurrection of our Savior and before the ascension

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.900
we understand that he gave the Great Commission as we often refer to it as

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.519
You can read about the Great Commission and each of the Gospels again in the book of Acts

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.959
But you'll be mindful of the fact that he the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:16.000
He said that we have been given this duty this job to preach the gospel to every creature

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.120
What a unique privilege and responsibility it is

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.720
we understand that as we read through the book of Acts that we have the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.980
Privilege of being able to see the way in which the disciples

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.760
obeyed the declaration that Jesus gave and how the

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.199
obedience of the disciples

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:39.680
Resulted in the gospel going far and wide and many churches being established

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.760
You should read through the book of Acts. You'll find that there are two in my

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:52.080
Estimation just just amazing statements that are made in the book of Acts from those that opposed the gospel

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.160
These are not statements that were made by the leaders of the church

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.760
They're not made by the Apostles or one of the disciples

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.120
but we find that these are statements that are made by those that were in opposition those that were the

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:10.899
adversaries to the gospel going forth and really the statements that are made revealed to us the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.320
obedience of the disciples and the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.639
Work of Christ as we obey God and we do what he's told us to do

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.639
We see that he blesses beyond measure

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.520
the first of those statements is made in Acts 5 in verse 28 when those that are

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.559
Opposing the work of the ministry say this ye have filled

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.559
Jerusalem with your doctrine

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
that's a good thing, isn't it and

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:41.199
We have commanded you not to speak in his name yet. Ye have filled

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.160
Jerusalem with your doctrine. Oh that it would be said of us here in northern, Virginia

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:55.399
That we have filled this community this region of the state this part of our nation with the gospel of Jesus Christ

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.240
We find that later in Acts 17

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:04.919
When Paul and Silas would arrive to the city of Thessalonica that those in opposition said these

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.240
That have turned the world upside down

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.759
Are come hither

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.440
Also these that have turned the world upside down have come hither also that's Acts 17 in verse number 6

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.559
we find that

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.559
The gospel is powerful

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:28.559
we find that as you read through the journeys the missionary journeys as we'd often refer to them as in the book of Acts and you'll

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.199
find how that the

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:37.479
missionaries would arrive to a particular city a particular region you see how that the gospel preached change lives and

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.559
the power of the gospel those

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.960
That the cities that would be changed and transformed and just the the way in which the Lord would work mightily

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.800
I believe for us this morning that each and every one of us that we could stand

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:57.679
If we've been saved and we can stand and declare the power of the gospel in our own very lives

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.600
How he changed us what he's done in and through us as we look at Romans 1 in

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.559
Verses 14 through 16 this morning. We really are reading

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.360
the heart of the Apostle Paul as he's beginning to write to these believers in Rome and he shares with them some

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.440
important truth and I mentioned that our theme for our conference this year will begin on Saturday with the

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:27.600
Dinner and then Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday the theme of our conference is from Romans 1 16

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.000
I am NOT ashamed. I am NOT ashamed of the gospel

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:38.640
Why because Paul understood what the gospel is he understood that the gospel is powerful and as we look at this

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.799
Passage of Scripture. It is a familiar passage of Scripture

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:46.339
I want to make three observations this morning and I trust that as we consider these

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.880
Aspects of the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul that this morning we would be challenged

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.959
Through these verses notice in verse 14

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.279
Paul says this I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.660
Both to the wise and to the unwise

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:13.279
So as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:19.760
For I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:26.359
to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.799
to the Greek as

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.480
We look at this passage of Scripture. I'd like for you to consider first of all

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.720
The perspective of the Apostle Paul as we look at verse number 14

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.279
We begin to see his perspective and as we would consider his perspective

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.279
We would understand that the phrase and we'll use one phrase from each verse as we look through our message this morning

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.200
We would see that his perspective is summarized in these three words in first number 14. I am

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760
Debtor I am debtor

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.079
You understand that as we would look at this passage of Scripture and understand that as Paul is writing to these believers in Rome

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.000
That he is sharing with them his personal responsibility

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:11.079
He has understood he has acknowledged and embraced the fact that he is

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.359
Personally accountable to God Almighty we find that as he would communicate these words and as he would say I am debtor

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:25.200
I want you to consider with me this morning. Really the the way in which these words would communicate the seriousness of Paul

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.839
He did not take this matter lightly

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:36.119
This this was not something that it was just a matter of convenience or if perhaps an opportunity would present itself

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:41.000
But you find that this perspective of the Apostle Paul when he says I am debtor

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:46.720
That as we look through the passage of Scripture and we consider the life and ministry of Paul as it's revealed to us

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.519
Throughout the Word of God

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:55.799
We find that it's this perspective that motivated him that allowed him to be used in the fashion in which he was

00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:03.079
I am debtor. I mean notice he's he's not even saying to those in Rome that you are indebted

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:08.760
He's saying of himself. He's taking the personal responsibility and he's taking it seriously

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.799
I am mindful even as I read this passage of Scripture and I think about the way in which the

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.399
Apostle Paul is revealing to us that he is indebted

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.760
I'm mindful of what the angel said to those shepherds in Luke chapter number two. You'll be mindful that they were there

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.720
abiding in the field and those

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.959
Angels that appeared they say that I bring unto you right these glad tidings

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.880
But it says I bring unto you what shall be to all people

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.720
this wonderful

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.920
Proclamation that was given there in Luke 2 was not to just be given to the shepherds and held by the shepherds

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.959
But they were to go and proclaim

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.359
That message that Messiah was coming that he was born and we find this

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.559
This morning that as we look at this passage of Scripture that the gospel

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:05.480
the truth of the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ has been given to us and we are

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.000
Indebted to give that truth to a lost and dying world

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.760
You'll notice that he uses the phrase in verse number 14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.440
to the barbarians

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.440
This was a very common idiom that would be used in this particular time and really what he's communicating

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:28.480
Is that he is indebted to all people?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.880
Not just a certain group of people but to all people and we understand that as we've said many times over the years that

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.400
from the

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.119
Biblical perspective that we'd understand that there are simply two categories of people on this globe

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.359
There are people that have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:50.919
They are saved and heaven-bound and there are people that are lost in their sin

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.719
They are dead in their sins and their trespasses and the Bible says that the wage of sin is death

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:59.159
The Bible says death and hell will be cast like a fire

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:03.919
So we find it as we look at this passage of Scripture and we understand what Paul is saying

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:09.479
He's saying I have been entrusted with something that other people need

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:15.400
The gospel I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:22.640
both to the wise and to the unwise as we consider the perspective of the Apostle Paul and

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.039
We notice the way in which he would use this terminology to communicate to us

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.640
By way of preservation the seriousness. I wonder this morning

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.159
How often do we take this matter as serious as Paul took it?

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:43.919
I wonder this morning how often how many of us would ever look at ourselves as being a debtor as being

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:47.760
Indebted to give this message to a lost and dying world

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.919
We find that as Paul would often communicate to those that he was ministering to I want you to look at what he says to

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:56.880
The believers in Corinth turn over if you will to the first Corinthians 9

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.640
And I want you to look at what Paul says

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.220
with regard to this responsibility that he had.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.140
As we consider the responsibility,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.640
and this is his perspective,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.980
you will find why it was that Paul

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.520
went from city to city,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.060
and as the Scriptures will say,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.600
as his manner was,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.860
he would enter into a city

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.760
and begin to preach the Gospel.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.500
It's a perspective that we need.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.280
It's a perspective that I need.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.000
That we would have this perspective

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.260
that I am dead here.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.900
Notice 1 Corinthians 9 and verse 16.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.240
For though I preach the Gospel,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.760
I have nothing to glory of,

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.660
for necessity is laid upon me.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.960
Yea, woe is unto me

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.420
if I preach not the Gospel.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.860
Notice in verse 23.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.500
And this I do for the Gospel's sake,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.340
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.220
Begin to see that Paul says,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.260
woe is unto me there in verse 16,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.540
if I preach not the Gospel.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.660
I wonder how often we go through our lives,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.820
and I wonder if perhaps there's a period,

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.400
a season of time in our lives

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.200
where maybe there's a few days

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.620
or maybe even a few weeks

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.940
that would pass by,

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.380
and we've not had the privilege

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.300
of sharing the Gospel with someone.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.380
I wonder if we'd say like Jeremiah

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.180
that it's just bubbling in me.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.900
It's like a fire within me.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.380
I just can't wait to give the Gospel

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.540
to someone, anyone that would listen,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.140
because I understand the truth

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.780
and the power of this wonderful message.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.700
And Paul says, woe is unto me

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.420
if I preach not the Gospel.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.780
He said I am debtor.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.460
And I just wonder if we can in our minds

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.340
remember the last time we were able

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.060
to share the Gospel with someone.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.140
I wonder if you can go to that place

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.820
in your mind and you can say,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.020
I remember the last time I was able

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.460
to share the Gospel with someone,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.100
and maybe they trusted Christ,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.500
maybe they weren't interested,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.740
but you remember that last time

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.500
you were able to speak of Christ

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.540
and speak of the good news of the Gospel.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.100
Can I tell you this morning,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.660
if that memory is way, way, way back somewhere,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.340
I hope this morning that we'd have

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.860
that fire rekindled.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.660
And we'd say, man, I just want to find someone

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.660
to give the Gospel to,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.060
because I'm indebted.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.900
I am debtor.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.100
Notice what he says in 2 Corinthians 4.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.340
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.340
Paul says to these same believers in Corinth

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.180
in the same city,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.020
this now second letter that he writes

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.340
in verse number three of this chapter,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.340
we find that Paul says this,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.100
if our Gospel be hid,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.700
it is hid to them that are lost.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.340
We obviously understand this morning

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.340
that those are the people that need the Gospel.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.580
Those that are lost.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.540
They need it.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.860
We're indebted to them.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.820
And Paul says if our Gospel be hid,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.460
it is hid to them that are lost.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.220
Notice what he says in verse number seven,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.460
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.260
that the excellency of the power

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.740
may be of God and not of us.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.300
I notice the way in which he says

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.060
we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.020
We're but clay.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.020
I mean, we're really nothing

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.740
except for the fact that we've been made

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.860
in the image of God Almighty

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.780
and the fact that God Almighty

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.500
came and died for us

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.020
so that we could be redeemed

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.020
and what a wonderful privilege,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.460
but we have this treasure,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.620
the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.820
Paul, in between the two verses

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.660
that we've read here in 2 Corinthians 4

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.260
and verse three and verse number seven,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.060
we find that he mentions

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.820
about the work of the enemy

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.380
to keep blinded the minds of those

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.540
that have not received the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.020
And we understand that the enemy is alive

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.940
and active and he's working.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.300
This morning, as Paul says here in verse number five,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.500
we preach not ourselves,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.060
but Christ Jesus the Lord

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.100
and ourselves your servants for Jesus's sake.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.700
We don't preach ourselves.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.460
I often say to individuals

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.140
as I have the privilege of sharing the Gospel with them,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.660
I'm not asking you to come to our church.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.460
I'm not asking you to give to our church.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.860
I'm not asking you to do any.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.180
I'm just trying to share with you the truth

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.220
of what Jesus Christ did for you

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.020
because one day you're going to die.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.740
Are you ready?

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.060
Are you ready?

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.300
See, I am dead hurt.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.500
Notice what he says in 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.140
We'll move on to verse number 15 in Romans 1 here,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.580
but look at what he says here

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.500
in 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.020
I made the statement by way of introduction this morning

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.060
that second statement that's made in the book of Acts

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.580
that's so impactful was in Acts 17 in verse six

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.540
when Paul and Silas arrived at the city of Thessalonica

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.220
and now he's writing this epistle back to these believers.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.700
And I want you to notice what he says

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.140
in 1 Thessalonians 2 in verse number four.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.940
And I believe that this will continue

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.100
to help us understand this perspective of Paul.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.620
Notice what he says.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.140
But as we were allowed of God,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.980
notice what he says,

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.500
to be put in trust with the gospel.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.180
Even so we speak, not as pleasing men,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.540
but God which trieth our hearts.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.740
I notice a few things here from verse number four

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.740
of 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.860
Number one, I understand that it's a privilege.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.460
He says we are allowed of God.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.900
Isn't it amazing that God would allow us

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.620
to be his spokespeople, to be his messengers.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.580
In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul says that we are ambassadors.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.380
And you think about that unique privilege

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.260
and opportunity that is ours.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.620
And here Paul says that we were allowed of God.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.220
And then notice that phrase,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.540
to be put in trust with the gospel.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.980
He says it this way in 1 Thessalonians

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.400
that we were entrusted to be put in trust with the gospel.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.640
In Romans one, I am debtor.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.920
Why did he recognize himself as being a debtor?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.280
Because he had been entrusted with something.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.120
And that something that he had been entrusted with

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.200
changed his life,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.560
but it was something that he had to give to others.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.680
So as Romans one, in verse 14,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.720
we first consider the perspective of the apostle Paul

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.000
when he says I am debtor.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.520
Number two, in Romans one, look at verse number 15.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.000
Not only do we consider his perspective,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.600
but I consider his preparation.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.000
Consider the preparation of the apostle Paul.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.880
Notice what he says.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.540
So as much as in me is,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.820
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.840
that are at Rome also.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.960
We use the phrase from verse number 14

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.960
with regard to the perspective of Paul.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.000
I am debtor.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.040
We'll use the phrase from verse number 15

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.560
with regard to his preparation.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.840
I am ready.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.500
I am ready.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.100
And we think about the apostle Paul,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.100
what he's saying here.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.420
So as much as in me is,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.260
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.480
that are at Rome also.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.620
When that opportunity presents itself,

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.460
are you ready?

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.540
Have you prepared?

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.140
Have you understood this perspective

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.340
that would then lead to this process of preparation?

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.100
See, we understand that as Paul

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.740
would have the perspective that I am debtor,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.700
that I have been entrusted,

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.300
therefore we prepare.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.420
We want to be ready to give the gospel

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.700
to those that we would come into contact with.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.420
Perhaps there's been a time in your life

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.820
in which you have had a conversation

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.420
and you've left that conversation

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.180
and you've kind of said something like this,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.180
man, I wasn't really ready to give the gospel

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.700
in that particular setting.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.540
I wasn't mindful of it.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.940
And maybe as you walked away

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.980
from that particular interaction that you had,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.180
you said, man, I wish that I had handled

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.380
that conversation differently.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.620
I wish I would have taken that conversation

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.180
more towards the gospel

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.740
and being able to present truth to that individual.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.140
We, as we look at the perspective of Paul,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.340
we then understand the preparation.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.980
I wonder this morning,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.220
as we would engage in conversation

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.340
that we come into contact with individuals

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.500
and we engage in conversation with them,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.980
I wonder if we're ready to figure out

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.020
in those conversations how we make a beeline to the gospel.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.100
We can talk for a long time about things

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.380
that really don't matter.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:46.500
Right?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.299
I mean, you talk to people

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:50.380
and they want to talk about the weather.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.500
They want to talk about sports.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.780
They want to talk about COVID

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.580
and they want to talk about all kinds of things.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.619
I shared briefly a testimony on Wednesday evening

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:03.900
about an individual that I had contact with on Tuesday.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.940
As I was speaking with them,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.340
they were, what did they want to talk about?

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.859
They want to talk about the gas crisis

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:10.859
because that was the thing that was going on

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:13.059
that particular day on Tuesday, right?

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:15.660
And that was what they wanted to talk about.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.660
And then it just went from the gas crisis

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.619
to you just name it, it was a free for all.

00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:23.220
And as I stood there and listened to that individual

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.100
for that duration of just a few minutes,

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.580
my mind was thinking, how do I get to the gospel?

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.619
How do I get to the gospel?

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:32.299
How do I get to the gospel?

00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:35.100
And as he paused just long enough,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.179
I was able to share with him truth

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:38.940
from Hebrews chapter number two.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.140
And then went over to the truth

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.100
in the book of Revelations,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.380
begin to share truth and try to take the conversation

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.820
to biblical matters, to the truth of the gospel.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.299
Listen, there's all kinds of things

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:52.340
going on in our world today.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.220
There's all kinds of opportunities for us

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.100
to talk about the way in which we find

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.100
some of these prophetical things in the word of God.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.740
that are lining up and the way in which we see these things progressing and oh we

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:12.740
have opportunity. The question is are we ready? When I think about this term I am

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.140
ready, I think about someone that has entered into, they're mindful of,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.820
and they're saying I am ready to preach the gospel. I'm ready, I'm prepared, I'm

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:29.020
mindful of it. I have prepared. The preparation of the Apostle Paul, I want

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:35.420
you to think about what he says in Galatians chapter number one. You'll be

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.220
mindful of the fact that Paul was converted and it's recorded for us in

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:48.180
Acts chapter number nine on the road to Damascus. His name was Saul at that time

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.620
and we find that after the first missionary journey which is recorded for

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.940
us in Acts 13 through 15. This is in the region of Galatia and he's now

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.500
writing back to those churches here in this book, but I want you to notice what

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:10.340
he says in verses 11 and 12 with regard to this thought of preparation. He says

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:16.620
this, but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.860
after man. For I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.940
revelation of Jesus Christ. Look over if you will skip down to verse number 18

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:34.140
and notice that he says then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:41.500
Peter and abode with him 15 days. During that period of time Paul was going

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.420
through some preparation. He was being instructed it says by the revelation of

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.020
Jesus Christ in verse number 12 and there's not a whole lot that we know

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.700
about that period of time in Paul's life, but we understand that there was this

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.820
process of preparation. You understand that as he would write to those that

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.300
he's ministering to over the years and as God would use them to write scripture

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.740
that often he will say to those individuals that he's writing to and

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.060
he's ministering to I say unto you by the Word of the Lord and he's giving

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.900
them the truth of God's Word. We find that even as he would deliver to these

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.060
individuals in Corinth the gospel that he helps them to understand that it's

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.540
the gospel of Jesus Christ what had been given to him he's then delivering to

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:34.380
others. I've been asked many times over the years what is it that you believe as

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.180
a Baptist? What is it that makes you different then? And they'll just start

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.700
listing some other denomination or group and I want them to understand that we're

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:52.740
seeking to follow the Bible. As a Baptist our number one if you will just a

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.900
statement that we seek to make with regard to our distinction is that the

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:03.420
Bible the Word of God is the sole authority for faith and practice. It's

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.780
something that we just kind of some traditions that we just follow like in a

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:13.540
in a wrong manner but we're seeking to follow the Word of God. What sayeth the

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:20.660
Lord? And if we're going to give truth if we're going to be ready to give the

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.780
gospel as Paul says in Romans 1 and verse number 15 we we have to have some

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:31.340
preparation. How is it that I'm going to give the gospel? What answer am I going

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:37.500
to give to someone when that opportunity presents itself? I'm mindful

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.060
of Ezra in the Old Testament in Ezra 7 and verse number 10 if you want to

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.980
jot that reference down but Ezra says in that passage of Scripture that he

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:54.420
prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:02.500
Israel statutes and judgments. What a powerful verse of Scripture. Ezra he says

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:08.500
that he he was prepared as we would see that he understood that he sought the

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.620
law of the Lord to do it and then to teach in Israel statutes and judgments

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.900
the time of his preparation preceded the opportunity that was afforded him. We

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.660
find that if you were to read throughout Ezra 7 that's verse number 10 if you

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.300
read the remainder of chapter 7 and really get into chapter number 8 you see

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.260
that opportunities are given to Ezra because of the preparation that he's

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.460
already gone through. This morning as we think about these statements from

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.220
Romans chapter number 1 I believe that if we have that proper perspective in

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.380
verse 14 that I am dead or that it will lead us to that proper preparation of

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.460
being able to say I am ready and then as we have prepared I believe that God

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.140
will give us opportunities that he will present us with those opportunities. Why?

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.540
Well if we take these two thoughts in connection this morning then we are

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:09.260
mindful and we are looking for the opportunities because we have understood

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.860
the perspective that I am dead or and we've gone through the preparation I am

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:18.260
ready and therefore we are now looking for those opportunities. There are simple

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.860
statements that you can make to people that cause them to stop in their tracks

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.460
and inquire as to what you mean. I met a guy when I was in Bible college that

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.500
every time you asked him he wasn't in Bible college he was a preacher that

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.380
came through he preached a revival meeting at the college I think a couple

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.020
of the years that I was there and anytime you asked him how he was doing

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:45.020
he said better than I deserve. Why did he use that phraseology? Because countless

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.700
times he had the opportunity with saying to someone better than I deserve they

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.540
say what do you mean by that and then he had the privilege of being able to

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.940
right then right now go into sharing the gospel. Because when's the last time you

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.780
introduced yourself to someone or asked someone how they were doing and they

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:07.340
told you better than I deserve. It's not common it's not regular right and so

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.980
when you hear something that's out of the ordinary something that you're not

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:15.620
expecting it causes you to stop and say what do you mean by that? I told you the

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.660
story about the man at the bank when I said I was absolutely wonderful he says

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.180
you're lying nobody's wonderful huh I said you ain't met mr. Don yet because

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.140
he's been in the hospital bed and he's absolutely wonderful amen but he told me

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.900
I was lying that's what he told me I promise you

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:39.660
I was in Wells Fargo right over here on Germantown he said you're lying nobody's

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:47.380
wonderful I said well I'm going to heaven man I am wonderful and then he

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:53.020
got all kinds of sideways he's like are you dying I don't think so but one day

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:59.620
I'm going to amen and so are you what I'm suggesting to you this morning is

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.820
that I'm not perfect at it there are more times when I fail than I'm doing

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.180
what I'm supposed to do but that were mindful that were purposed and

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:16.700
understanding I am indebted I have been given the gospel of Jesus Christ it's

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.940
changed my life and now I have been entrusted with I better be ready to give

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:28.860
it notice in verse number 16 back in Romans 1 we consider the perspective of

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.580
the Apostle Paul we consider the preparation of the Apostle Paul and now

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:39.820
I want you to consider the passion of the Apostle Paul in Romans 1 in verse

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:48.700
16 he says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.820
God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to

00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:03.260
the Greek perhaps this morning you've not yet recognized this but I would

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.620
submit to you and I believe it to be the case that we're currently living in a

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.980
society in which they want you to be ashamed of believing the gospel they

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.900
don't want you to go talking about what you believe they want you to be ashamed

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.220
of the gospel of Jesus Christ that's the society that we're currently living in

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:30.060
but Paul says I'm not ashamed I am not ashamed as you study the New Testament

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.380
you'll find that Paul had a passion to reach people with the gospel of Jesus

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.020
Christ he understood what was at stake and he personally embraced the

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:45.420
responsibility we use the the phrases in verse 14 I am debtor in verse 15 I am

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:52.580
ready here I am not ashamed Paul as he would speak about in this very book the

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:59.300
book of Romans when he would speak about his brethren other Jewish individuals he

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.900
would speak about the way in which he had heaviness and continual sorrow in

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:08.580
his heart in chapter 9 and chapter 10 he would reveal his heart's desire in

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.380
prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved you see a man that that

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.780
that was passionate about reaching people with the gospel of Jesus Christ

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.100
we find that this morning it's absolutely possible for us to have

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.740
passion in a variety of ways we find that there are people that we come into

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.380
contact with every day of our lives that are passionate about something whatever

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.260
that something is if you get them on the subject that they're most passionate

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.900
about they can talk about it and talk about it and talk about it some more you

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.340
know what I mean there are people that are passionate I just wonder this

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:54.700
morning do we have this same perspective and would we have that level of passion

00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:00.620
to be able to say I am NOT ashamed of the gospel of Christ

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.660
Again, the society wants us, why does the society want you to be ashamed of it?

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.180
Because there's a spiritual war that's going on.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:14.340
I hear more and more and more from folks all around in different periodicals that I receive

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.820
and different emails that come across my desk of people that want to talk about the cultural

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.820
war that we're engaged in.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.900
And I submit to you, as I did a couple of years ago in preaching through the book of

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.780
Ephesians, that it is so much more than a cultural war, it is a spiritual war.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.300
We're engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.980
And what happens at times in our lives is that we come into the place where we cower

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.540
in fear of sharing the gospel with someone because we're afraid of what they're going

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.020
to think or say.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:51.060
And we're fearful and therefore we do not give the truth of the gospel.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.380
We shy away from it.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:58.580
We cower in fear and we find that this is happening at increased levels.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.620
I'm going to share some things with you this evening.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.660
I'm going to preach from the book of Jude and I'm going to look at a few things that

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.780
I hope would challenge us to have this proper perspective.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.740
I understand that some won't be back this evening and so I'm going to read this tonight

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.420
so those that come back you'll hear it again.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.940
But this is something that someone said with regard to acknowledging some of the great

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:26.020
hymns of the faith that we sing that were written many years ago in a generation that's

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:32.540
gone now and we find that they made this observation in mentioning about some of these

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:38.900
hymns that were made and here's what they say, in days when reaching the lost seemed

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.860
to be more of a priority for most believers.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.100
I read that first statement, I'm going to read the whole thing to you this evening,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.580
but I read the first statement, I highlighted it in yellow and it just crushed me as I read

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.980
it.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:00.380
In days when reaching the lost seemed to be more of a priority for most believers.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.100
Why isn't it a priority for us today?

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.140
What else has become a priority for us today?

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:11.380
And we've kind of not had that passion and we find that Paul had a passion.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.020
He said, I am not ashamed.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:18.740
We find that Paul, listen, he had his encounters with those that opposed the message that he

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.740
preached.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.740
Amen?

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.620
There was opposition at every level and we find that there were times in which, and you

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.780
look at the first missionary journey, every city that they went into and they preached

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.700
the gospel and people got saved, they got ran out of.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.940
Because there's opposition.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:43.100
But Paul still says, near the end of his life, I am not ashamed.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.600
Why?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.620
Because I understand what the gospel is.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:53.540
I understand that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.620
To everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.380
See, I mentioned this a moment ago, that Paul had an understanding of what was at stake.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.460
Do you recognize this morning that each person that you come into contact with, whether that

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.320
be a coworker tomorrow, a neighbor this afternoon, someone at the restaurant in which you'll

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.320
have lunch this afternoon, every person that you come into contact with is going to die

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.960
and they're going to go to either heaven or the lake of fire.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.720
That's just the reality.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.040
And we find that he understood what was at stake.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.400
These people aren't going to believe me.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.640
These people are going to oppose me.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.920
Well, at least I gave them the truth.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:44.460
And I can stand before God and say, I told them, I did what I was commanded to do.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:53.360
Look at Acts 17, if you will, as we think about this passion of Paul.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.000
We've noticed his perspective, we've noticed his preparation, and now as we consider this

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.160
passion of his, we find in Acts 17, this is when they arrive in Thessalonica, according

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:12.200
to verse number one, notice in verse two, and Paul, look at these words, as his manner

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:20.720
was, went in unto them in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.960
We find that in verse number two, the Bible tells us as his manner was, this was the manner

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960
of Paul.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960
This was his behavior.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960
This is what he did.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960
He comes into a city.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.320
He's seeking to preach the gospel, to give the truth, as his manner was.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.720
Notice what it says in verse 16.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.920
Now you'll understand if we understand kind of what's going on here, the people that had

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:50.240
troubled in other cities had now come to Thessalonica, and so they have Paul, they sent him out,

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.840
and in verse number 16, the Bible says, now while Paul waited for them in Athens, his

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.200
spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.400
We find that Paul, really, if we were to understand what's taking place, and without

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.560
having time to go through all of it this morning here in Acts 17, that they send Paul out ahead,

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.880
and they're going to basically get a little R&R, if you will, because of all that has

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.960
been encountered, and yet we find that when Paul is there, and he's waiting for them,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.840
he's at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.120
Here's something that I've learned in my own life, and perhaps you can relate to this as

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:32.400
well, is that it's possible for us to be stirred up and do nothing about it.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400
It's possible.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:40.840
Oh, that God would stir us, and it would bring forth some action.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.520
No matter how small that action is, we've got to start somewhere, amen?

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.560
Maybe this morning, your prayer, because you can't remember the last time you shared the

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.560
gospel with an individual, as I mentioned earlier in the message, maybe the prayer this

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.520
morning of someone is, God, in the next 30 days, would you help me to share the gospel

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.240
with someone?

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.880
Maybe someone's prayer this morning is, God, would you help me in this process of preparation?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.560
I'm not even sure how to take the conversation into the gospel.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.000
Whatever it is, we start somewhere, because being stirred is a good thing, but that stirring

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.680
needs to bring forth some action in our lives, and some change in our lives, and we find

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.560
that here, the Bible says that he was stirred in his spirit, that his spirit was stirred

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:32.360
in him, and then notice verse 17, therefore, because of the stirring, what was it that

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.040
caused Paul to be stirred?

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:42.800
He saw a city that was wholly, entirely, completely given to idolatry, and his spirit is stirred

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.480
within him, and it says, therefore, because of what he saw, because of how he was stirred,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.200
therefore, disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.400
in the market daily with them that met with him.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.000
What's Paul do?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.840
Enough with the R&R, there's work to be done, amen?

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.320
I'm not suggesting that we don't ever need rest.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.920
Jesus says, come apart and rest, amen, and we understand that there's a need for that,

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:17.320
but you look at Paul, and you see how he's stirred, and how he is brought to action.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.200
He disputes with them.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.800
Notice it says that, there in verse number 18, then certain philosophers of the Epicureans

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.120
and of the Stoics encountered him, and some said, what will this babbler say?

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.400
You know, some are going to call you a babbler, that's okay.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.600
You know what Jesus said, newsflash, if they hate you, they hated me.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.600
Isn't that what Jesus said, John 15?

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.800
You go and look at it, that's what Jesus said.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.340
They say, what will this babbler say?

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:51.380
You know that there were people that encountered and went to where Jesus was teaching just

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.940
to criticize him?

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.180
That was the only reason why they went.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.260
I'm reading through the Gospels right now, my personal Bible time, and as I'm reading

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.940
through the Gospels again, and I'm reading, I just finished Mark this morning, and as

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.660
I'm reading through the Gospels again, and I'm reading, and I'm just mindful, hey listen,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.180
sometimes they just come to criticize him.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.700
You know, that helps me when I get criticism.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.220
There's some people that watch on that camera, on the other side there's a computer, and

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.900
they only watch to criticize.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.300
It's just the way it is, and that's okay.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.100
But what I'm saying this morning is that they might say, this babbler, don't worry about

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.500
that, just give the Gospel.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:35.540
Notice what they say, he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods, because he preached

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.820
unto them Jesus and the resurrection.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.820
What's he preaching?

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.420
The Gospel.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.500
The Gospel.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:49.060
In verse number 23, he says this, as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:55.140
with this inscription to the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:59.340
declare I unto you.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:06.820
You know, we live in the midst of a lost and dying world.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:13.020
We live in the midst of a people that are going to spend eternity somewhere, and there's

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.540
only two options.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:20.100
I know that there are other groups of people that teach other things, but when you go to

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:30.020
the Word of God, you find that there's but two destinations, heaven and the lake of fire.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:37.000
Because it is appointed unto man once to die, but after this, the judgment.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.100
We find this morning that we need to understand what's at stake, and when we understand what's

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:47.140
at stake, it will impact our passion, and Paul, he's passionate and he's going.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.940
In chapter number 18, when they get to Corinth, in verse number 4, it says this, and he reasoned

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.900
in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks, and what's he doing?

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.340
He's giving the Gospel.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.420
It says that they opposed themselves and blasphemed and all these sorts of things

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.660
are happening but you find that the Lord Jesus Christ comes and encourages him.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.740
Notice what it says in verse 9, then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:18.540
a vision, be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace. For I am with thee

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:24.380
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.360
You know what Jesus said when he gave the Great Commission as it's recorded in

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:38.200
Matthew chapter 28? The last words in lo I am with you always, right? He's with us

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.800
and Paul receives encouragement because of this opposition and Corinth he goes

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:49.080
and he's preaching the gospel and God says the Lord says be not afraid but

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:58.080
speak and hold not thy peace. Be not afraid and speak. He says I am with thee.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.200
What a precious promise of the Word of God. Turn over another couple of pages if

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.240
you will and look at Acts 20. I want you to notice what Paul says here in Acts 20. He's

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:16.980
here speaking to the leaders of the church at Ephesus. We think about the

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.100
passion of Paul to give the truth of the gospel. Notice what he says in verse

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.380
20 and 21. And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.340
showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:37.300
to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.700
our Lord Jesus Christ. Skip down in verse number 31 if you will. Therefore watch

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:46.980
and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone of

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:54.980
everyone night and day with tears. Paul says I kept back nothing that was

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.540
profitable unto you. He says that he was testifying both to the Jews and also to

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.940
the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. He

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:12.140
says that he did it with tears. He had a level of passion to just reach someone

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:21.060
with the gospel. And I believe this morning as we think about this portion

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.060
of scripture a familiar passage Romans 1 14 through 16. We notice these

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.420
statements and we are able to consider the perspective and the preparation and

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:37.060
the passion. I wonder this morning do we have a passion to reach people with the

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:45.940
gospel? The songwriter said we sing the song give me a passion for souls dear

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:54.180
Lord. A passion to reach the lost. What a wonderful hymn that is. And I just

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.980
wonder this morning what is it that we are passionate about? What is it that

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.980
if someone were to be asked, maybe a co-worker, maybe a friend, a neighbor,

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:12.540
maybe a family member, what is so-and-so passionate about? What would they say?

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:20.060
Would souls even be on the list anywhere as to what we're passionate about? Give

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:25.580
me a passion for souls. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.820
power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:36.660
to the Greek. As we draw closer to the Lord I believe that he will develop in

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:43.580
us a passion for souls as we draw closer to him. See because as we draw closer to

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.700
our Lord, as we walk with him as we're supposed to, we find that we'll begin to

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:56.820
love what he loves. Amen? Listen, before I was saved I didn't love the Bible. Before

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.780
I was saved I didn't love church. Before I was saved I didn't love the brethren.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:07.220
Before I was saved I wouldn't give my money to a church or to missions. But as

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.660
we get saved and then as we walk with the Lord and as we draw closer to him we

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:23.620
begin to love what he loves. Jesus said this in Matthew 4, follow me and I will

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:31.860
make you fishers of men. They were fishers of fish. I am not a fisherman.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:37.300
I've never been accused of being one. In fact, Joseph, I think it was their

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.620
basketball team, maybe it was a class, I can't remember where he was, he was the

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:47.060
only kid that his dad had not taken him fishing. I felt bad. I felt horrible. I

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:53.780
don't even have a fishing rod. I just, I don't know. I need to go to one of those

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:59.700
stocked ponds, you know what I mean? Where it's just easy. But the reality is that

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:06.460
these guys were fishers of fish. It's what they did. And Jesus said follow me

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:17.040
and I will make you fishers of men. The closer we get to the Lord the more we're

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:24.160
gonna love what he loves. And God so loved the world that he gave his only

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:31.280
begotten Son. Aren't you thankful for that love? The Bible says that he

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.080
commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:43.240
We've been the recipients but now we've been entrusted with something. And my

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.160
prayer, not only through the preaching today, I'm gonna preach another message

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.680
tonight on this same topic and really thinking about missions and next week as

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.680
we have our missions conference, anticipate hearing messages about

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:05.560
reaching the lost, reaching the world. My prayer for me and for each of you is that

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:12.760
God would not only stir us up but he would change us. That we would be changed

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:18.440
not just emotionally stirred but that we would be changed and that we would get

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:25.360
this same perspective that Paul had that would lead to a level of preparation and

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:31.280
give us a passion to reach people with the gospel. Listen, I believe we sang the

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.080
song Jesus is Coming Again. Some of you probably heard it says maybe morning,

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.920
maybe noon, maybe evening. The songwriter said maybe soon. I always say will be

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:48.600
soon. I think Jesus is coming back soon and I'm looking forward to it. Our time is

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:55.440
short. Amen? We have a work to do. May the Lord use us for his honor, for his glory.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:01.160
Father we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:08.200
opportunity of looking at this passage of Scripture. I know it's familiar. I

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.560
pray God that you would help us to have a proper perspective. That we'd

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:20.040
understand that we are debtors. That we have been entrusted with the gospel of

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:28.080
Jesus Christ and that lost men need that message. Would you help us to prepare?

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:35.600
Would you help us to be mindful of taking those conversations and turning them to

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.960
spiritual matters? So that we might have the privilege of sharing the gospel with

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.600
those that we come into contact with. Oh in a day and age in which the hostilities

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:53.400
and the opposition seems to increase daily, I pray that you'd help us to not

00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:01.240
be ashamed. Help us to be passionate. I pray God that you would not only stir

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.080
us this morning, but I pray that you'd change us. Help us to leave this place

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.080
understanding that we're entering into the mission field. I'm thankful for the

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.440
missionaries that we send across the seas, but you've caught us to simply go

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:24.480
across the street to our neighbors, our co-workers, our family, friends. Lord would

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.320
you use us for your glory. Would you help us to be mindful of the power of

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.680
the gospel. I pray that you'd move and work as only you can. For it's in Christ's

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.600
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.280
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. As she does, would you allow the

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.800
Lord to have his will and way in your life? Perhaps you want to use your pew as

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.800
an altar. Perhaps you want to come to this old-fashioned altar. But as Kimberly

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.600
plays, we invite you to respond to the message this morning.
