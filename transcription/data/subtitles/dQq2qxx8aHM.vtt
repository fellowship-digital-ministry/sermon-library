WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
12. And so thankful for the opportunity to be gathered together. And today we resumed

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.520
our children's church ministry. And so that's why you don't see some of the children in

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.079
here this morning. And Lena and Jennifer have agreed to be able to teach that class. And

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.920
so we're thankful, kind of get some ministries back and going. We resumed student ministries

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.799
on Wednesday evening, several weeks ago. And we thank you for your continued prayer and

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.680
faithfulness. Hebrews chapter number 12 this morning, I'll be looking at verses one through

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.400
three. Of course, you know that our theme for 2020 has been looking unto Jesus, the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.159
banners behind me. And that is from Hebrews chapter number 12, verse number two. And as

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.580
we look at this particular passage of scripture, I believe that we are mindful of that which

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.439
we have studied up to this point. And we find that the writer of Hebrews, of course, all

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:02.439
scripture is given by inspiration of God. And we know that God is giving this message

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:07.239
to these first century believers that were dealing with some difficult days, they were

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.800
dealing with some opposition, they were dealing with some thoughts of returning to Judaism.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.300
And so we find that the book of Hebrews lays out that Christ is superior, that he's better.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.639
And you say better than what? Yes, better than everything, better than anything. And

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:27.199
throughout the first section of the book of Hebrews, we find the evidence that is given,

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:35.040
overwhelming evidence is provided to conclude rightly that Christ is superior. We find that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.279
we then, as we conclude the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews, really beginning in chapter

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:44.959
number six, he dealt with it, he gave them a challenge, but the challenge contained in

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:50.760
the concluding verses of Hebrews chapter number 10 is to press on. Really, we could describe

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.360
it this way, forward by faith. There's no retreating. We're not of those that turn back.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.480
We go forward. We find that as we'd study and read through the book of Joshua in the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.639
Old Testament, the theme of that book could very simply be forward by faith. And we find

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:10.440
that that challenge is given at the end of chapter number 10. And chapter number 11,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.419
the content that is provided for us are those that have lived by faith, those that have

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:23.539
gone before us, those that have ran their race, those that have left an example that

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:29.580
we can follow. We find that there's a challenge, and then chapter 11 provides this content

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.220
of all of these Old Testament saints that faithfully fulfilled that which God had called

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.500
them to do. We find the Bible concluded in verse number 39 of Hebrews 11, and these all

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.820
having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise. And what a blessing

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.820
to have the content of Hebrews chapter number 11. Many have referred to that passage as

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.660
being the great hall of faith chapter. And what a blessing to read through and to be

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.839
reminded of those various accounts from the Old Testament that would encourage us and

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:12.899
would challenge us. We find that as we enter into the first few verses here of Hebrews

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:17.500
chapter number 12, that really there is a call that is extended to every believer in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.740
these opening verses, and that call is this, run the race. Run the race. We find that the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.979
challenge was given to go forward by faith, the content of those that have faithfully

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:37.259
run their race, and then this call for us as God's people. You begin to see that here,

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:42.259
the terminology, the word us is used four times in verse number one. And so not only

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:48.300
is the writer of Hebrews acknowledging that he himself has a race to run, those believers

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.559
that are being written to, but even as the word of God has been preserved for us even

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:59.779
till today, that we too have a race to run. And look in verse number one, the Bible says

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:07.139
this, wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.940
let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.220
run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.660
of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.859
shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:43.660
such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.179
This morning, if you're taking notes, I've simply entitled the message, Run the Race.

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:54.019
Run the Race. As you know, the Bible uses analogies to describe the Christian life.

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:59.540
Here, the analogy of running a race is in clear view. The Apostle Paul has used this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.579
analogy in other portions of Scripture. In fact, if you hold your place here in the book

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:07.420
of Hebrews and turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, I want you to notice what

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.940
he writes to this church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, verses 23-27,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.339
we find that he's writing, I said chapter 10, I meant chapter 9, please excuse me. 1

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:24.899
Corinthians chapter 9, verses 23-27. Notice what Paul says here as he's writing and challenging

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:29.779
these believers in Corinth. Beginning in verse number 23 of 1 Corinthians 9, the Bible says

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:37.299
this, and this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:46.859
Verse 24, know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize.

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:51.380
So run that ye may obtain. Of course, there's an analogy being used here. They would have

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.700
some level of understanding of what Paul is dealing with, with the games that were so

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.899
common, and he says here in verse number 25, and every man that striveth for the mastery

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:09.619
is temperate in all things. Now, they do it, those that run those temporal races, they

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:18.220
do it to obtain, look at what he says, a corruptible crown. A corruptible crown. But we, what is

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.059
he saying? An incorruptible. I therefore, Paul gives his testimony here, I therefore

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:31.100
so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beateth the air, but I keep under

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.339
my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:42.700
others, I myself should be a castaway. As he's writing to the churches in the region

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.220
of Galatia, and we know that it was there on that first missionary journey that Paul

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.459
had the opportunity to go into the region of Galatia to see churches established, and

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:58.540
as he would write the book of Galatians back to those believers, he uses once again that

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.339
analogy, he alludes to the subject matter of the analogy of running a race, and here's

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:08.940
what Paul says to those believers in the region of Galatia in Galatians 5 and verse number

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:18.700
7, he says, ye did run well. Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth? Now,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.380
if you are familiar with the content of the book of Galatians, you'll understand that

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.179
there were some Judaizers that came in after the apostle Paul had been there and established

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:33.500
those churches, and he leaves, and of course, the book of Acts would give us the record

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.940
of all of those travels. We find that there were those that came in, and in the first

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.260
chapter, Paul says this with regard to their ministry and their deception, that they're

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.320
coming in, they're preaching another gospel, he says, which is not another. Notice in chapter

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.420
number 1 of Galatians, he says this in verse number 6, I marvel that ye are so soon removed

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.299
from him that called you unto the grace of Christ unto another gospel, which is not another,

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:04.299
but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:08.420
or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.779
unto you, let him be accursed. What strong language is used to deal with these false

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:20.220
teachers? And we find that as he would, near the end of this letter that he would write

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:28.899
to these believers, he said, ye did run well. Who did hinder you that you should not obey

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:35.900
the truth? As we keep in mind the message to the church in Corinth, the message to the

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.380
believers in the region of Galatia, and we look at our passage this morning here in Hebrews

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.619
chapter number 12, verses 1 through 3, if you're taking notes, I would submit to you

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:50.539
number 1 this morning, that you must be fit for the race. You have to be fit for the race.

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:55.340
What do I mean by that? Well, if we were going to have a physical race, you would train for

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.539
that race. These that are mentioned in 1 Corinthians chapter number 9, when they would

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:04.940
go to compete in those games, they would train, and they would train diligently, and they

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:12.380
would prepare, and they would suffer and do various things to themselves, self-infliction,

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:18.020
so that they could run to obtain, as Paul says, a corruptible crown, something that

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.700
would fade away. And so we'd understand if we were to run a race, if we were to circle

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.859
a date on a calendar, there'd be some preparation that we'd go through. We speak about this

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:34.820
spiritual race that we're running. It's called the Christian life. If you're saved this morning,

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:40.460
you're in the race. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. I've never ran a marathon. It's

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:47.500
said to me, obviously, when you have and you understand the marathon race that takes place,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.979
there will be a winner of that particular race, but many that compete in running a marathon,

00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:59.979
their goal is to finish the marathon. In fact, the percentage of people on

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:05.859
the planet that have ever successfully completed a marathon is extremely low.

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.819
The number of people that have actually attempted to run a marathon is extremely low.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:14.099
I saw the percentages a number of years ago, I'm sure they've changed as of now, but a

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:17.499
number of years ago I saw the numbers and I thought, you know, I'm going to train to

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:19.099
run a marathon.

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:21.259
I don't look like a marathon runner, do I?

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:24.979
I said, I'd like to be in that percentage and I'm going to train to do so.

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:29.419
I got up to the fact where I could run about seven or eight miles and I was bored out of

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:34.219
my mind and I said, there's no way, I quit, I'm not going to continue, 26 miles, that's

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:39.639
like triple what I've been training and I've never done it, I've never ran a marathon.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:45.059
But we think about this spiritual life and we think about this Christian life and being

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:46.219
fit for the race.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:48.539
How is it that we can be fit for the race?

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:53.779
We notice in verse number one, the Bible begins by speaking about that which has been discussed

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.779
already in chapter number 11.

00:10:55.779 --> 00:11:00.299
When the Bible says, we're foreseeing we also are encompassed about with so great a

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:07.739
cloud of witnesses, it's interesting that phraseology when he speaks about these witnesses,

00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:12.059
it's not only somebody that has witnessed something, but somebody that has experienced

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:17.539
something and we know as we've studied the content of Hebrews chapter number 11 and we've

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:22.819
gone through the names of those that are provided and of course, last Sunday morning in rapid

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:27.699
succession dealing with all of those names and events that are referenced and how our

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:33.399
minds race back to the events that are referenced and we think about those Old Testament saints

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:38.739
and what they experienced and now we find that the instruction with regard to being

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.779
fit for the race is given to us.

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:47.659
Notice it says, let us lay aside every weight.

00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:53.659
If you were to run a physical race, you would maybe train with some added weight to help

00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:59.499
prepare you for the day of the event, but no doubt on the day of the race, you would

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:04.939
want to have the lightest shoes and the lightest attire because you don't want anything to

00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:08.179
hinder you, anything to weigh you down.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:13.259
And we find that spiritually speaking, the instruction given to these believers and given

00:12:13.339 --> 00:12:19.219
to us this morning is let us lay aside every weight.

00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:24.979
Weights are those things that will hinder and distract you from running the race.

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:29.979
A weight is not necessarily sin, but a weight is a hindrance.

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.419
It's a distraction.

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:37.459
It's something that would cause us to become entangled with the affairs of this world.

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:42.699
It reminds me of what the Apostle Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number two.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:48.539
He's using a different analogy in this passage of Scripture dealing with the Christian life.

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.979
He's dealing with that of being a soldier.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:56.259
Here we're dealing with running the race and the idea of being an athlete, but we find

00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:01.739
that as Paul is writing to his son in the faith and he's given Timothy this last letter

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:08.099
that he would write before he would go to be with the Lord, Paul is instructing Timothy.

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:12.339
And notice he tells him in 2 Timothy chapter number two in verse number three,

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:17.619
thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:22.859
But then he says this in verse number four of 2 Timothy two.

00:13:22.859 --> 00:13:32.779
No man that woreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:37.419
him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:43.099
We think about the soldier, he cannot be entangled with the affairs of this life, of

00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:48.299
this world, and we find that as we notice the instruction to the believers here in Hebrews

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:54.179
chapter number 12, when they're being given this call, this challenge to run the race,

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:58.219
we find that he speaks in this first verse about the importance of being fit for the

00:13:58.219 --> 00:13:59.219
race.

00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:00.219
And what do we need to do?

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:04.139
Well, number one, let us lay aside every weight.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.939
Can you identify distractions in your life?

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:11.739
Can I tell you this morning that distractions abound?

00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:15.319
They really do.

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:19.299
The enemy loves to distract us.

00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:24.219
By the way, the enemy loves to distract us with something that's not necessarily sinful,

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:26.379
but just not doing what we're supposed to do.

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:32.299
I listened to a part of a sermon from a man of yesteryear.

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:35.619
He's now with the Lord, and I can't think of his name right now.

00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:38.019
Joseph, who was it we were listening to together?

00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:39.659
Adrian Rogers, amen.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:43.579
When I hear his voice, I know that's Adrian Rogers, but I just couldn't think of it now.

00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:47.419
But I was listening to Adrian Rogers, and he was speaking on the subject of time.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.899
It was a good message.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:56.579
And he said this, so often, the urgent takes our time instead of the important.

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:59.099
And he gave a great analogy.

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:04.379
He said it's important for me to spend time in the Word of God, and I'm sitting there

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:09.419
and I'm reading the Scriptures, and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do in my daily walk with

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:15.939
God, and my wife hollers in and says, honey, the toilet is overflowing.

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:17.979
That is urgent.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:21.099
And urgent takes me away from what is important.

00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.819
That was a great illustration.

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:28.619
The reality today is that distractions abound.

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:31.379
Mark was holding up his hand like this, speaking of the cell phone.

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:34.499
Oh, what a distraction the cell phone is.

00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:36.779
We see it on the roads when we drive, do we not?

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:38.499
Have you seen a distracted driver?

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:42.619
I mean, we see them all the time, and these people are on their phones, and they're not

00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:43.819
paying attention.

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:47.699
But can I tell you, in life, we can get distracted.

00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:55.779
There are so many things that would distract us from doing what God has called us to do.

00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:02.019
And he says, let us lay aside every weight, everything that would hinder us from doing

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:04.179
what God has called us to do.

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:10.419
Can I tell you this morning that we must become efficient at being able to identify distractions

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:12.259
in our lives.

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:18.059
And it's important that we become proficient at identifying those distractions earlier

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:21.139
rather than later.

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:26.939
When I'm going through life and I have those tasks before me that I know that God has called

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:32.199
me to do and to fulfill and to complete, I must be careful that I can identify those

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:37.379
things that are becoming a hindrance and a distraction.

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:40.619
They're going to take my time.

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:42.339
I try to avoid social media.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.939
I don't have any social media personally.

00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:49.179
I've been told that I have an account somewhere, and I get some kind of notifications.

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:51.859
I couldn't log into it if you asked me to.

00:16:51.859 --> 00:16:55.899
But the reality is that I would submit to you this morning that social media becomes

00:16:55.899 --> 00:16:57.739
a serious distraction.

00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:01.499
Somebody begins to look at something, and then all of a sudden it leads to something

00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:03.419
else and something else and something else.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:07.019
And before you know it, you look up and you say, where did the time go?

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:09.459
Distractions.

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:11.859
I'm not going to give you a whole list of distractions this morning.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:18.539
I think that we're able to identify some distractions in our lives.

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:23.299
The writer of Hebrews, can you imagine, as we look at this analogy that is given with

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:29.619
regard to the spiritual life and running this race, how well is a physical race runner going

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:33.019
to do if he's constantly distracted?

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:34.739
He's looking over here, and he's looking over here.

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:35.739
He's distracted, right?

00:17:35.739 --> 00:17:37.819
It's just not going to work out so well.

00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:39.139
We look at the next point.

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:43.499
He says, not only lay aside every weight, notice what he says, let us lay aside every

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:50.459
weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us.

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:54.819
You know, the reality is that we are in this world, but we're not of this world.

00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:58.939
Can I tell you that all around us is evil, is sin?

00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:03.979
And whether or not we, as we look at this passage of Scripture, we have to come to that

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:07.739
understanding and that conclusion that there's sin that's all around us.

00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:14.499
And it's so simple that the enemy makes it look so good and so appealing, and we find

00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:19.499
that the writer of Hebrews is saying, listen, there's some things that we need to set aside.

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:24.499
If we're going to run this race, if we're going to do what God has called us to do,

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:28.699
if we're going to be fit for the race, we've got to lay aside every weight.

00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:32.380
We've got to lay aside the sin which doth so easily beset us.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.859
We're mindful of what Jesus said in John 17 as He's nearing the time in which He would

00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:39.820
go to the cross of Calvary.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.940
And we find that He's praying.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:48.059
And there as He's praying, He says, I pray not, beginning in verse 15 of John 17, I pray

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:53.339
not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:54.339
the evil.

00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:57.219
You understand that we live in an evil world.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:02.739
By the way, it's not hard for us to be able to conclude that statement this morning.

00:19:02.739 --> 00:19:04.659
We live in an evil world.

00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:07.260
There's sin all around us.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.899
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ as He's praying, He says that thou shouldest keep

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:12.899
them from the evil.

00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:14.219
Notice verse 16.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:17.859
They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:20.500
We've been mentioning that from Hebrews 11.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.500
I'm a pilgrim.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.099
I'm a stranger.

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:24.299
This world is not my home.

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:26.539
I'm just a passing through.

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:27.539
And what a blessing.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:30.219
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

00:19:30.219 --> 00:19:37.299
Verse 17, sanctify them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:40.760
Oh, how we need to be in the Word of God.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.500
We live in an evil world.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.500
Sin abounds.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.179
It's all around us.

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:51.219
And oh, how we need to be in the Word of God regularly.

00:19:51.219 --> 00:19:56.539
I said to someone recently, and I did not mean it to sound harsh or unkind, but the

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:59.940
reality is that a proverb a day is just not enough.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.960
We need all of the Word of God.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.820
We need to get into the Bible and allow the Bible to get into us.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.500
A man of yesteryear made the statement, I thought it was such a profound truth.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:19.700
He said that thumbprints in the Bible are more important than footprints on the moon.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.700
I like it.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.740
People want to talk about great accomplishments and what have you.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.540
Oh, that we just get into the Word of God.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.540
Sanctify them through thy truth.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.440
Thy Word is truth.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.820
Notice as we conclude verse number one, he says this, not only that we let us lay aside

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:42.820
every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.460
race that is set before us.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:53.540
Run with patience, understanding that this is a marathon, not a sprint.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.580
Understanding that we are in this race.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:03.980
We are engaged in running this race, and as we begin to understand the manner in which

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.980
the writer would instruct us with being fit for the race, and we enter into the first

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.100
statement of verse number two, and we come this morning not only with being fit for the

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.620
race, but number two, if you're taking notes, our focus during the race.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.900
Our focus during the race.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.540
When we acknowledge and are aware of the truth that is given to us in verse number

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:32.459
one, we find the instruction in verse number two of such great value and importance.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:39.260
The Bible begins in verse number two by saying, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.100
of our faith, and we'll read the rest of the verse here in just a moment, but we understand

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:50.020
that as the book of Hebrews is giving us this responsibility and the call is issued

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.900
to every child of God to run the race, he says, listen, there's some things that you

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.300
have to do in order to be fit for the race, but when we understand the weights and we

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.819
understand the sin that is all around us, let me encourage you to focus on Christ during

00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:06.819
the race.

00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:11.419
Oh, that we'd have our focus on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:15.979
Can I tell you this morning that the more time we spend in His Word, the more our focus

00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:17.979
will be upon Him.

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:21.779
We find this morning that there are so many things, as I mentioned in the first point

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:24.860
this morning, there are many things that would distract us.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.059
There's all sorts of distractions in life, and we find that the enemy wants to get our

00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:32.619
focus on something else.

00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:41.619
The events of life, the happenings all around us, the storms that are raging, my mind thinks

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:46.699
of Peter as he says to the Lord Jesus Christ, they were frightened in the boat in the middle

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:53.220
of a storm, and Jesus appears, and He reveals Himself to the disciples, and Peter says,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.339
if it's You, bid me come to Thee.

00:22:55.339 --> 00:23:00.660
You remember when Peter walked on the water, and Jesus said, come.

00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:04.260
When he stepped out of the boat, was the wind boisterous?

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.740
Absolutely, they're in the midst of a storm.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.660
He stepped out in the midst of a raging sea.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.699
He walked toward Jesus, and the Bible tells us that in just a little while, He got His

00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:22.860
eyes upon the waves, upon the sea, upon the tempest that was raging around Him, and what

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.860
happened?

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.419
It began to sink.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.779
I'm thankful that he had enough sense to cry out, Lord, save me.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:31.779
The Lord saved him.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:35.979
The Lord rescued him and took him back to the ship.

00:23:35.979 --> 00:23:37.619
But I think about our focus.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:40.660
Where are we focused this morning?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.419
What has our focus?

00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:46.680
We find that during this race, we must be looking unto Jesus.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.260
We find that many that have gone before us have given great testimony of the importance

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.900
of keeping our eyes on Jesus and looking to our Savior, and we sing songs about it,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.660
and we've had, obviously, for all of our theme of 2020, looking unto Jesus, banners have

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.180
been before you.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.900
You've been given much instruction with regard to the thought.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:14.979
Could we not easily, in 2020, understand that there are many things that are seeking for

00:24:14.979 --> 00:24:17.459
your focus, for your attention?

00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:23.059
Oh, how we need to be focused in this race on our Savior.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:30.260
Notice the Bible continues and says that He is the author and finisher of our faith.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:36.420
We find that He then begins to show us some things with regard to the life and ministry

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.580
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we would find that throughout His earthly ministry that

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.940
He was focused upon the purpose that He had.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.580
We understand that He was born to die.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.860
In fact, as we look at the Scriptures, we understand that all the way back in the book

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:57.619
of Genesis, we find the prophecies with regard to Messiah and all of the typologies, and

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:01.580
many of them have been referenced here in the book of Hebrews, with the fact that Jesus

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.220
Messiah would come, and He would live a perfect, sinless life, and He would die upon the cross

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.059
of Calvary.

00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:10.700
I'm thankful that the story doesn't end there.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.339
He was buried in a borrowed tomb, and He rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:18.059
the grave, and He lives forevermore.

00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:23.160
One day, He's coming back to receive us unto Himself, and what a joy that is.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.500
But we find that the text continues here in verse number two.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.220
Not only does it speak about Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, and then notice

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:38.980
who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.179
down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:47.220
How long has it been since you've read the end of any of the Gospel records?

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:54.580
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all contain for us the record of the death of our Savior.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.299
I would submit to you this morning that as you read the record that is given in each

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:08.059
of the Gospels with regard to the price that was paid for our redemption, it will cause

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:09.619
you to weep.

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:17.220
It will cause you to have a greater level of appreciation for your salvation, to understand

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:24.059
what the Lord Jesus Christ went through, to understand what He endured on the cross.

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:30.380
Notice it says, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:38.220
Jesus, as God, understood that as He would go to the cross of Calvary that He would complete

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.339
redemption's plan.

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:46.940
That the very price that were to be paid for the redemption of mankind was the precious

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.940
blood of Christ.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.339
In fact, as we read in Philippians chapter number two, hold your place there in Hebrews

00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:58.380
and turn over to Philippians two if you will, and we find that here the Apostle Paul is

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:05.619
making mention of this very thing of the approach of the Lord Jesus Christ and His humility

00:27:05.619 --> 00:27:09.179
and His obedience to going to the cross of Calvary.

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:14.420
And we find here that He endured greatly, but He did it, why?

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.540
For the joy that was set before Him.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:24.299
Hebrews five of Philippians two, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:28.739
who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself

00:27:28.739 --> 00:27:34.339
of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men.

00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:41.059
Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:47.860
the death of the cross, wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.980
which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.220
heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:03.980
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:10.779
When you read the accounts in the gospel records of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:17.100
you read first about the trials that He had and you read about the scourgings that He

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.059
endured and you read about the mockery that He faced.

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:28.299
You read of those that would ask Him to prophesy as they would seek to inflict harm upon our

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:32.539
Savior.

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:38.179
For the joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross.

00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:42.460
You know that the Romans had perfected crucifixion.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:48.940
They had perfected it in such a way that they sought to inflict as much pain upon the one

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.260
being crucified as possible.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.700
They sought to perfect it so that not only would it inflict the most pain, but it would

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.380
be the most agonizing, slow death possible.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:09.900
So that they could stay upon that cross literally at times for days.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.179
People would walk by and see.

00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:17.340
Pilate was amazed when they came and said that Jesus was dead already.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.460
Remember they came and they broke the legs of the thieves.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.460
Why?

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.460
So that they would die.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.179
They no longer could hold up their weight with their broken legs and they would die.

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:29.220
And yet when they came to Jesus, He was already dead.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.220
Why?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:35.140
Because the Bible says that He gave up the ghost.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:41.419
The Bible tells us that He laid down His life, that He might bring it again and we

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:43.580
understand the truth of the resurrection.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.460
But I want you to understand that the prophecy of the Old Testament is that there would not

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.539
be a bone broken of our Savior.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:52.820
You see the fulfillment of prophecy.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.820
What a blessing.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:59.940
But can I tell you that He endured great hardship for your salvation, for my salvation.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.060
What a joy to be able to speak to people and understand this morning that it is a free

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.620
gift.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.620
But our Savior suffered greatly.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:18.180
We find that the Bible then says He endured the cross despising the shame.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:23.460
Hebrews 12 and verse number 2 notice and is set down at the right hand of the throne of

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.460
God.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.460
He lives.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.060
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.140
What a joy to know that we serve a risen Savior.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.620
What a joy to know that on that first day of the week they came early to the tomb and

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.740
they found that the stone was rolled away.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.700
They begin to be sorrowful and the angel says, I know why you're here.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.260
Why seek ye the living amongst the dead?

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.900
He is not here for He is risen as He said.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.020
Oh, what joy.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.060
We understand immediately there was some confusion amongst the disciples.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.340
We find that Jesus eventually appeared to them in Galilee as He said that He would.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.840
We find that the word of God would record for us that after He had appeared to them

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.740
for many days and had given instruction, then Acts chapter 1 records for us the ascension

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.779
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when He ascended to heaven.

00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:18.980
Really the reference here in Hebrews 12 and verse number 2 at the end when it says that

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.940
He sat down at the right hand of the throne of God, it really reminds us all the way back

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.500
to the beginning of Hebrews chapter number 1 when the Bible says, God who at sundry times

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.459
and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these

00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:41.459
last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom

00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:45.819
also He hath made the worlds, who being the brightness of His glory and the expression

00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:49.459
of the image of His person, upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:56.620
by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high, being made

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.580
so much better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.420
than they.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.180
And here as we come to the end of verse number 2 of Hebrews 12, it says, and has sat down

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.220
at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.820
I'm so thankful that one day He's going to come again.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.260
Amen?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:23.699
I mean, the Bible tells us that the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and we understand

00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:28.820
that as we sing songs about the return of Christ, we understand that right now He's

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:34.100
seated at the right hand of the throne of God, but one day, He's going to come back.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.820
I'm so thankful for that truth of the word of God.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.500
We find the example that is given to us, let me say this, as we've mentioned already that

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:46.580
throughout His earthly ministry, the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, that He

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.779
was focused on His purpose.

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:53.500
You understand in John 8 and verse number 29, He says this, I do always those things

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.380
that please Him.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.699
We mentioned already from John 17 and verses 15 through 17 about the fact that we're in

00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:05.300
the world but not of the world, but we find that Jesus, as He's praying, as He begins

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.699
that prayer, He says, Father, the hour has come, glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may

00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:15.419
glorify Thee, and just a few more verses as we really think about the transition to

00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:20.540
our final point this morning, He says this in John 17 and verse number 4, I have glorified

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:26.619
Thee on the earth, I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.

00:33:26.619 --> 00:33:28.460
Jesus was focused.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:34.100
He had a purpose, and He'd be focused upon that purpose.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.900
Can I tell you this morning that we need to be focused upon our Lord and Savior, Jesus

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.400
Christ.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.360
As I'm focused upon the person of Christ and I'm focused upon my Savior, it helps me as

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.520
I run my race.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:52.160
It helps me to avoid those distractions and those hindrances that life wants to bring,

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.479
that the enemy wants to distract us with and derail us from the course in which we've been

00:33:57.479 --> 00:34:00.160
called to run.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.559
We find that we have to be fit for the race.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:06.559
We find that we must be focused during the race.

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:10.800
This morning, if I could submit to you that number three, we need to finish the race.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.400
We need to finish the race.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.760
You know, how you finish matters.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.600
Unfortunately, there are those that you can read of that started well that did not finish

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.440
well.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.480
I hope that we would have the prayer that the Apostle Paul had as he spoke to the Ephesian

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:36.000
elders in Acts chapter number 20, and he said this to them, he said that I might finish

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.040
my course with joy.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.839
Look at a few things about the Apostle Paul at the end of the message this morning.

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:47.640
When we begin to think about the call that's been given to us of running the race and we

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.119
find that we need to be fit for the race, we need to be focused for the race, we need

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:52.799
to finish the race.

00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:56.880
Jesus finished, as we mentioned already in John 17 and verse number four.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.200
He said, I've glorified thee, I finished.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.940
We find that in John 19 and verse number 30, he cried out on the cross of Calvary before

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.399
he gave up the ghost.

00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:12.339
He said, it is finished.

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:17.619
Notice as we look at the text of Scripture in Hebrews chapter number 12, notice verse

00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:19.820
number three.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.260
The Bible says for consider him.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.940
The word consider is an interesting word.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:29.619
It means to think over, to ponder, to muse upon, and we begin to think if there were

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:35.179
a period there after that for consider him, that no doubt there are many things that we

00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.559
could consider about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:35:38.559 --> 00:35:42.839
No doubt as we would begin to think about his earthly ministry and all of the wonderful

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:46.799
things that are contained within the word of God concerning his ministry, there are

00:35:46.799 --> 00:35:49.239
many things that we can ponder.

00:35:49.239 --> 00:35:51.880
There are many things that we can think over.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.600
But there's not a period in your Bible, there's not a period in my Bible, for the Bible is

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.540
going to tell us what the writer wants us to consider with regard to the subject matter

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.959
that's at hand.

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:07.360
The subject matter at hand, finish the race, run the race.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:16.459
Notice it says for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.

00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:17.980
Wow.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.700
Here as we look at Hebrews 12 and verse number three, they, the original recipients and us

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.000
this morning by way of preservation, we have been given this charge to consider something

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.640
specific about the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we consider this within

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.720
the context of running this race, shall I say finishing the race, and what is it that

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720
we consider?

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.600
Well, we consider the contradiction of sinners that Jesus faced.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.600
You understand that he faced great difficulty during his life and ministry.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.519
Do you understand that on many occasion, I believe that as you would look through the

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:58.839
gospel accounts, you'll find in times in which the enemy sought to destroy Jesus before

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:01.600
he could ever go to the cross of Calvary.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.160
You understand that the enemy, the Sadducees and the Pharisees on more than one occasion

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.279
described they picked up stones to stone our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:14.760
But shall I say to you this morning that he could not die from stoning.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.200
He had to go to that old rugged cross.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.200
It's what had been prophesied that he would go to that cross and he would shed his precious

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.440
blood for you and for me and for all of mankind, and we find that Jesus, he suffered those

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440
things.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.200
He endured the contradiction of sinners.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.480
By the way, shall I say this, turn over to the book of Matthew, if you will, in chapter

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480
16.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:43.440
I want you to notice here in Matthew chapter number 16, Jesus is speaking often as we begin

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.440
to think about this passage, our mind will race to the truth, the promise that is given

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.519
in verse number 18, when Jesus said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:55.119
not prevail against it, and what great promise that is.

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:59.279
Just prior to Jesus making that promise, he says to the disciples, he says, whom do

00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:00.279
men say that I am?

00:38:00.279 --> 00:38:02.119
They give an answer.

00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:05.399
Some say that you're John the Baptist, some say that you're one of the prophets, and so

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:10.360
on and so forth, and then Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.519
Peter stands up with great boldness and answers absolutely appropriately.

00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:20.839
He says, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:25.959
We find that Jesus would then, as he gives that promise that we mentioned a moment ago

00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:31.519
about the church and him building the church, notice in verse 21 of Matthew 16, notice the

00:38:31.519 --> 00:38:37.960
Bible says this, from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, what is

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.119
he going to show them?

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:48.599
How that he, what does it say, must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:57.640
and chief priests and scribes, notice, and be killed and be raised again the third day.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640
Jesus understood his purpose.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.320
Remember, we spoke about the focus in our previous point.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.640
He understood the purpose.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.080
He understood the reason that he came to this sin-cursed world was to redeem mankind, and

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:14.039
he begins at that time to share and to instruct his disciples with regard to those things

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:16.039
that would shortly come to pass.

00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:21.080
We find that Peter, he took him, and notice in verse 22 it says, and he began to rebuke

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080
him.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.000
Can you imagine?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.960
Peter says this, be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:38.080
Now from a human perspective, I kind of can understand why Peter had this perspective.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.359
Peter loved the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:42.119
Peter had walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:44.280
Peter had left all that he had.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.760
He left his fishing business, and he followed Jesus, and Jesus said, follow me and I will

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.559
make you fishers of men, and now Jesus is telling Peter that he's going to go and suffer

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.559
and die.

00:39:55.559 --> 00:40:00.000
Peter says, not so, but you notice that Jesus...

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.300
says this, "'Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou art an offense unto me, for thou

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:16.680
savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.'" See, Peter

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.319
didn't want the Lord to have to suffer those things, but the Lord knew, this is

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:33.959
my purpose. In the garden, we find that Jesus suffered greatly. He prays in the

00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:40.639
garden to let this cup pass. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. I believe,

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:43.759
I'll submit to you this morning, and if you disagree, we can talk later, that's

00:40:43.759 --> 00:40:48.639
fine. Some have sought to give the instruction with regard to that

00:40:48.639 --> 00:40:51.520
passage in that prayer that Jesus was praying that he wouldn't have to go to

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.439
the cross. I don't believe that. Jesus knew that he had to go to the cross. I

00:40:56.439 --> 00:40:59.560
believe that Saint was trying to kill him in the garden before he could ever

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:05.239
get to the cross, because the Bible here in Hebrews tells us that he, for the joy

00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:11.760
that was set before him, Jesus understood that which he would accomplish on the

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.639
cross of Calvary with his precious blood, the redemption of mankind, the plan would

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:20.720
now be complete with his death, burial, and glorious resurrection, and so we find

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:26.000
that Saint, I believe, was seeking to kill him so he can never make it to the

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.319
cross. When we begin to think about what the writer in Hebrews tells us here in

00:41:31.319 --> 00:41:35.879
Hebrews 12 and verse number 3, what it is that we should consider about the life

00:41:35.879 --> 00:41:40.319
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, we would find this, that in spite of great

00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:48.599
opposition, he finished the work that he was given to do. And I would submit to

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:52.559
you this morning that we need to take note. I would submit to you this morning

00:41:52.559 --> 00:41:56.839
that as we notice what he says that we would consider him, listen, there are

00:41:56.839 --> 00:42:02.199
going to be people that will oppose you. The enemy does not want you to run the

00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:06.839
race. The enemy does not want you to finish the race. The enemy is perfectly

00:42:06.919 --> 00:42:12.960
content with you being distracted and never fulfilling what God has called you

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:19.479
to do. God has a plan for your life. He has a plan for my life. Begin to think

00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:26.880
about the way in which the world, the enemy, and all of those, listen, Paul, he

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.279
knew he's supposed to go to Jerusalem. You know there were some well-meaning

00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:33.960
people that tried to prevent him from going to Jerusalem. But Paul said, I'm

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:40.440
ready to go and die if that's what has to happen. This morning, why do we

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.759
consider and why do we take note? Because the end of verse number

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:49.639
three, notice what it says, lest ye, see how it circles back to those that are

00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:53.720
being the recipients, right? Let us do these things and as we're running this

00:42:53.720 --> 00:43:01.960
race, let us look to Jesus and let us consider him. Why? Lest ye be wearied and

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:13.360
faint in your minds. Lest ye be wearied and faint. No, we do not desire to be

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.839
wearied. We do not desire to faint. We desire to press on, to persevere, to

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:26.080
finish that which God has called us to do, to finish our race as we deal with

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.039
the opposition, as we deal with the adversity, as we deal with all of those

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.759
things that would come into our lives to distract us and hinder us from doing

00:43:34.759 --> 00:43:38.919
what God has called us to do. As we're looking to Jesus, as we've considered

00:43:38.919 --> 00:43:44.639
these things about the very contradiction and the difficulties

00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:49.800
that he endured, that we too would be able to continue and run our race. That

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:56.960
we would finish our race. As we begin to think about the passage of Scripture and

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.639
we think about the call that's been given to us to finish, I've said as we

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:08.080
start at this point that how we finish matters. I want to finish well. I want to finish

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:15.080
strong. I want to finish our course. The Apostle Paul, as I mentioned by way of

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.040
introduction to this particular point as he's speaking to the Ephesian elders,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.880
turn over to the book of 2nd Timothy, if you will, and I'm going to read to you a

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:27.679
portion from Acts chapter number 20. You're in 2nd Timothy chapter number 4.

00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:33.679
I'm going to meet you there in just a moment. But in Acts chapter number 20, the

00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:42.320
Apostle Paul is speaking to these church leaders from Ephesus. He's beginning to

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:50.519
sharing with these men some of the things in which he dealt with. He speaks

00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:57.880
about the bonds and afflictions that abide him. And in verse 24 he says,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:04.839
"...but none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I

00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:12.600
might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:19.359
Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God." It's a great desire that the

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:24.000
Apostle Paul has that he expresses to the leaders of the church at Ephesus in

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.679
Acts 20 and verse 24. This morning perhaps each of us could stand and say,

00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:34.079
I want to finish my course with joy. Can I tell you, that's a good intention.

00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:39.600
There's some things you need to do in order to come to that place. And as the

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:46.660
Apostle Paul had that desire and expressed that desire, it led him to do

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.420
certain things in his life that brought him to the place where you are in 2nd

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:57.380
Timothy chapter number 4, where he's now writing knowing that he soon would die.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:04.220
And he's able to say this, "...for I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.380
departure is at hand." Verse 7 of 2nd Timothy 4, "...I have fought a good fight, I

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:17.179
have finished my course, I have kept the faith." I submit to you this morning that

00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:24.059
when Paul says this in 2nd Timothy chapter number 2, if we notice what is

00:46:24.059 --> 00:46:28.820
being said, we would conclude it didn't happen on accident. It didn't happen by

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:35.820
chance that he finished the course. There were some things that he did, because he

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.380
mentions all the way back in Acts 20, when he's speaking to those leaders in

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:46.299
the church at Ephesus, "...I want to finish my course with joy." You could study the

00:46:46.299 --> 00:46:50.619
life and ministry of the Apostle Paul, and you can see various things that he

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:55.779
did along the way, and some difficulties in which he endured, and no doubt as he

00:46:55.779 --> 00:47:01.779
endured great affliction. And he mentions this, he says that

00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:06.380
"...we're troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We're perplexed, but not in

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:12.700
despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken. Cast down, but not destroyed." You know what he

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.220
says in that same passage of Scripture in 2nd Corinthians chapter number 4? He

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:22.100
says, "...for which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:28.140
inward man is renewed day by day." Remember we talked about, "...sanctify them

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.019
through thy truth, thy word is truth." How important is that we're in the Word of

00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:37.540
God, so that we can have that renewal in our inward man. He says, "...for

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.299
our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more

00:47:41.299 --> 00:47:44.779
exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:48.179
are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are

00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:51.619
temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal." That's from 2nd Corinthians

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:58.339
chapter number 4. And Paul says to Timothy, "...I have finished my course, I have kept

00:47:58.339 --> 00:48:05.299
the faith." The Lord Jesus Christ finished the work that he was given. He

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:11.540
declares it is finished. We understand that he left us an example, as Peter

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:16.940
would say, that we should follow his steps. He is the perfect example. Then we

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:22.299
look at the Apostle Paul. We see the Apostle Paul finished his course too.

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:28.059
These believers in the first century that are first receiving this book that

00:48:28.059 --> 00:48:35.659
we call Hebrews, they're receiving this instruction. As we understand the content

00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:41.260
of what has been provided, we find that the Lord is encouraging them

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:47.580
and challenging them to press forward by faith, to continue on, to go on

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:57.219
unto perfection, as it says in Hebrews 6. The time is taken to provide a great

00:48:57.219 --> 00:49:04.299
list of those that have finished their course, finished their race. They ran

00:49:04.299 --> 00:49:10.979
their race. And then it comes right back to the believers and says, how about us?

00:49:10.979 --> 00:49:17.140
This morning we have a race to run. Oh, there's no track that we're going to go

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.940
take a field trip to and lace up the tennis shoes and have a foot race. It's

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.979
not the kind of race we're dealing with. But the analogy is given so that we can

00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:33.859
relate, we can understand. We wonder this morning, spiritually speaking, am I fit

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:40.700
for the race? Have I laid aside the things that I'm to lay aside? Or has the

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:50.299
world gotten me distracted from what he's called me to do? Not only did the

00:49:50.299 --> 00:49:56.140
Lord suffer those difficulties and those challenges that he faced, but you

00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:01.780
understand that there were some that were looking for him to set up a kingdom.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:07.300
Tell me that's not a distraction.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.620
You've come to deliver us from the Romans.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.500
I mean, they're ready to set up a, right?

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.380
Nope, that's not why I'm here.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.420
He came the first time to die.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:26.020
He's going to set up his millennial kingdom, but that wasn't the right time.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.700
Are we fit for the race?

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.840
Where are we focused during our race?

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.480
Are we focused on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.080
Are we looking unto Jesus?

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:42.360
I mean, are we really getting into this book and allowing this book to get into us to help

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.240
us to be properly focused as we run this race?

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.840
I wonder this morning, will we finish our race?

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.280
Will we finish?

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:59.400
I hope this morning that you would say with the Apostle Paul that I might finish my course

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.640
with joy, that that's your desire.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:10.320
Having that stated desire does not guarantee that you will finish your race with joy, but

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.440
it goes a long way to getting you there, amen?

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:20.680
And we state that desire, oh Lord, help me to finish my course with joy.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.800
And then we can come to that place, Lord willing.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.280
We get to the end of our life.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:33.240
We're going to pass through that door called death, and we'll ever be with our Savior,

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:38.400
that we could say, I have finished my course, I finished.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.840
I did what God has called me to do.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.200
This morning, what a great challenge is given to us in these three verses of Scripture in

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.200
Hebrews 12.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.880
I'm mindful of what Paul says at the end of the book of 1 Corinthians, really the 15th

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880
chapter.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:03.960
It's got 16 chapters, but in chapter 15, therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable,

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.880
always abounding in the work of the Lord.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.360
For you know that your work is not in vain, right?

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.600
Your work, Lord, is not in vain.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:18.240
And we just keep our eyes on the Lord, and we just say, by God's grace and with God's

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.720
help, I'm going to finish the race.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.520
Run the race, and run it well.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:33.520
Because we are not doing it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we're doing it to obtain an incorruptible

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.680
crown, that we would please our Savior.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.680
Let's pray.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.780
Father, we love You this morning.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.840
We thank You for loving us.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.040
Thank You for the challenge from Thy Word today.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:54.040
I pray, God, that You would help us to take heed to that which we have heard.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:53:01.480
Even as the writer of Hebrews includes himself in this, let us.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:11.240
Lord, I recognize this morning that each one, under the sound of my voice, including myself,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.040
we need to run the race.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.760
God, we know that the distractions abound.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.160
We know that there's opposition and adversity.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.080
I pray that You'd help us to be fit and focused.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.760
God, I pray that You'd help us to finish.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:34.400
And that we would finish well, that we would finish, as Paul said, with joy.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.640
Would You work in the hearts of Your people this morning?

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.440
Would You seal each decision that would be made?

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:48.880
I pray that we'd be responsive to the leading of the Spirit of God in our lives this morning,

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.960
during this time of invitation, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.840
Would You stand with me?
