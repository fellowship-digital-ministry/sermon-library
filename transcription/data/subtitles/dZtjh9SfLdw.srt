1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,879
at verses three through 15.

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:03,960
Last week, we looked at verses one and two

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,840
as we got into the second letter

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,119
that Paul is being allowed of the Lord

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,600
to write to his son in the faith, Timothy.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,939
Of course, our theme for this calendar year is continue.

7
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,800
We studied through first Timothy

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,440
and now studying through second Timothy.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,799
And with the Lord's help,

10
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:23,319
we'll finish this book as well during this calendar year.

11
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:27,959
And Paul was transformed on the road to Damascus.

12
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,959
We understand his encounter with Jesus

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:34,479
was always fresh on his mind.

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,000
His life was radically changed on that day

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,759
and he was living for the one who died for him.

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,319
I think about the Apostle Paul

17
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:45,040
and we understand as God would use him

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,180
to write so much of our New Testament as the human penman,

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,840
we know that all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
but as God would see fit to use the Apostle Paul

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,720
and we understand that his conversion

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,560
as it's recorded for us in Acts 9

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,680
was always fresh on his mind.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,779
I think another thought or truth

25
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,440
that was always fresh on his mind

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,239
was the fact that he knew

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,239
that one day he would stand before Jesus.

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,639
He understood that one day he would stand

29
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,879
before his Lord and his Savior.

30
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,480
And I believe that the Apostle Paul

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,379
had a great desire to please his Lord.

32
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,059
We find that in verse number three of our text of scripture

33
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,599
he talks about serving the Lord with pure conscience.

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,940
We find that his service to God

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,620
as we study through the missionary journeys

36
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,500
as they're recorded for us in the book of Acts,

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,639
as we have the opportunity to read the epistles

38
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:44,279
that he wrote and we get some glimpse into his heart

39
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,500
and his ministry, his heart for the Lord,

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,779
his heart for people,

41
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:52,779
and we find that he desired to please God with his life.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,099
I believe that Paul desired to serve the Lord

43
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,339
right up until the very last moment

44
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:01,980
with whatever opportunity God would give him.

45
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,739
Paul was one of those guys

46
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,379
that was seizing the opportunity.

47
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,419
He did not want opportunities to pass him by.

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,539
He was actively looking for those opportunities

49
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,699
to serve the Lord, to share the gospel,

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,419
to influence, to impact someone.

51
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,380
He knew as we mentioned last week

52
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,460
as we enter in to this letter,

53
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,380
to Timothy, 2 Timothy,

54
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,259
Paul knew that he would soon see his Savior face to face.

55
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,059
What a glorious truth.

56
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,139
You know, I don't know,

57
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,059
you don't know when we're going to die.

58
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:36,160
We, of course, speak often

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,759
and we're looking for the soon return

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,740
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

61
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,039
We're looking, listening for the trumpet

62
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,619
and the reality is that we don't know

63
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,460
the time of our departure.

64
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,500
We don't know when we'll take our final breath here

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,300
on this earth, but what a joy it is to know

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,339
that we will see our Savior face to face.

67
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,699
As the songwriter said, it will be worth it all.

68
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,759
Everything that you've done for Christ,

69
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,979
every act of service, everything that you do for Christ,

70
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,619
it will be worth it all.

71
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,100
You will not regret serving Christ

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,259
and I'm so thankful that as Paul

73
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,699
is nearing the end of his earthly life,

74
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,100
as he's knowing that he'll soon see

75
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,779
his Savior face to face,

76
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,720
I believe that in this letter,

77
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,940
if we could use this analogy this morning,

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,699
that Paul desired to make a final deposit

79
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,820
into the life of Timothy.

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,899
I believe that just as Paul had as his own life goal

81
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,139
to finish my course with joy,

82
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,339
he says that in Acts chapter number 20,

83
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,619
we find that in the context of making that comment,

84
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:48,460
he's telling that to the church leaders at Ephesus.

85
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,020
Remember, that's the same place

86
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,380
where Timothy is now serving the Lord in Ephesus

87
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,979
and Paul desired that he would finish his course with joy.

88
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,500
It's not gonna happen on accident.

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,899
It's not gonna happen by chance.

90
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,520
You have to be purposed

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,699
if you're gonna finish your course with joy

92
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,660
and I believe that just as Paul had that desire for himself

93
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,139
that he also had that desire for those

94
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,639
to whom he ministered.

95
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,199
He understood that he would see his Savior face to face

96
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,600
but every person that he ministered to,

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,799
every person that God gave him the opportunity

98
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,619
to impact and to influence,

99
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:26,239
he knew that they too would see Christ face to face

100
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,239
and he desired that they would please the Lord,

101
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,799
that they would finish strong,

102
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:35,799
that they would complete the work that God gave to them.

103
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,359
Paul understood, we mentioned it last week,

104
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,720
he understood God's will for his life.

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,279
He understood God's purpose in his life

106
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,160
and he was seeking to fulfill it

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,959
but as we look at the text this morning,

108
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,200
he understood that God had a plan and a purpose

109
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,279
and a will for Timothy as well

110
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,200
and he desired that Timothy would finish his race,

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
that Timothy would complete with joy

112
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,359
the work that God would give him.

113
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,359
Verse 12 is a very familiar verse of scripture.

114
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:07,760
In fact, it's the memory verse for the month of August.

115
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm gonna read that verse and we'll jump right in.

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,480
It's where I get the title for the message this morning.

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Notice in 2 Timothy 1 and verse 12,

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,220
for the which cause I also suffer these things.

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,519
Nevertheless, I am not ashamed

120
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,500
for I know whom I have believed

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that

122
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,940
which I have committed unto him against that day.

123
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,959
You know, it's interesting in verse number 12,

124
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,579
it summarizes all that I just told you

125
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,839
by way of introduction.

126
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,519
Paul was always fresh on his mind, his conversion

127
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,920
and he says here in verse number 12,

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,119
I know whom I have believed.

129
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,720
It was always fresh on his mind

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,959
that he trusted Christ as his savior

131
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,640
and we find that not only was it fresh on his mind

132
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,920
that he was saved by the grace of God

133
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,440
but he says at the end of the verse,

134
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,399
against that day, he was mindful regularly

135
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,200
that he would see Christ face to face.

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,519
This morning, I wanna preach a message

137
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,359
that I've simply entitled from verse number 12,

138
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:14,239
I know whom I have believed.

139
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:17,600
I hope this morning, just by one more moment of introduction,

140
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I hope this morning you know the Lord Jesus Christ

141
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
as your personal savior.

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,399
We sang that song when the roll was called up yonder.

143
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,700
Notice what the songwriter said.

144
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,079
I believe it was Mr. Black.

145
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,440
He said this, I will be there.

146
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,239
He didn't say I hope to be there, I might be there.

147
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,000
No, no, no, he said I will be there.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
Can I tell you this morning, you can know

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,920
that you know that you know that heaven is your home.

150
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,880
You don't have to hope so and doubt and struggle

151
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
with all of these thoughts.

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,480
No, you can know but it's not because of anything

153
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,440
that you've done, it's not because of anything I've done,

154
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,679
it's not because of anything that we deserve.

155
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,480
It's because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did

156
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,200
on a cruel cross.

157
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,239
When he bore our sin upon Calvary,

158
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:59,459
when he took upon him the sin of the world,

159
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,399
when he became sin for us, the one who knew no sin

160
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,000
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
when he was buried in that borrowed tomb,

162
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,440
but oh, he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave,

163
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,839
he's alive forevermore.

164
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,239
And when you place your trust in the finished work

165
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,640
of Christ at Calvary, not anything that you could do,

166
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,100
not my good works, not some religion,

167
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,720
but in the Lord Jesus Christ, you can have that assurance

168
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,559
that heaven is your home.

169
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:29,839
You go through life saying I know whom I have believed.

170
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,660
And I know that one day I'm gonna see him face to face,

171
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,179
oh, it's wonderful.

172
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,700
It's wonderful to be a Christian.

173
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,179
It's wonderful to know the Lord Jesus Christ.

174
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,299
Notice with me as we get into the text this morning,

175
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,179
number one, if you're taking notes in verses three

176
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,940
through six, we see Paul's concern for Timothy.

177
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,019
Paul's concern for Timothy.

178
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,140
It's given to us in these few verses

179
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,899
as we start looking at our text this morning,

180
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,859
we could use the word compassion as well as concern.

181
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,420
But notice in verse three, it says I thank God

182
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,420
whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience

183
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,140
that without ceasing, I have remembrance of thee

184
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,019
in my prayers night and day, greatly desiring to see thee,

185
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:13,619
being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy

186
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,820
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith

187
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,940
that is in thee.

188
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,940
Notice in verse five, which dwelt first

189
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,420
in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice,

190
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,679
and I am persuaded that in thee also.

191
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:30,220
Wherefore, I put thee in remembrance

192
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,979
that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee

193
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,619
by the putting on of my hands.

194
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:37,900
As we look at these few verses,

195
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,539
we see Paul's concern for Timothy.

196
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,059
Paul has a measure of concern.

197
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,900
He has compassion on his son in the faith, Timothy.

198
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,419
We've mentioned already that in verse number two,

199
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,460
we looked at it last week.

200
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,700
He says to Timothy, my dearly beloved son.

201
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,020
And the apostle Paul has concern for Timothy.

202
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,539
We've mentioned as we've studied through the first letter,

203
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,739
first Timothy, that Timothy was facing some difficulty.

204
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:03,979
He was facing some trials.

205
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,059
He was facing some opposition.

206
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,260
There's some false teachers there in Ephesus.

207
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,979
And it seems as if, as you read these two letters,

208
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:16,460
that Paul is writing to Timothy that there's such an emphasis

209
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,020
on the idea of continuing and finishing

210
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,179
because there was some measure of pressure

211
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,020
that Timothy was facing.

212
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,219
And can I tell you this morning that when we face pressure,

213
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,260
there's always the thought that I'm just gonna give up.

214
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,460
I'm just gonna quit.

215
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,940
The pressures are too much.

216
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,539
The pressures are overwhelming.

217
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,059
And there's a way out of these pressures.

218
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,979
It's just gonna be that I stop.

219
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:47,340
And so Paul is encouraging his son in the faith, Timothy,

220
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,380
to continue.

221
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
And he has concern for him.

222
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,580
And this concern is evidence to me

223
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,059
as I look at these few verses of Scripture

224
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,500
as we begin this morning.

225
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,739
How is it that we see the concern

226
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,299
that Paul has for Timothy?

227
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,139
Well, number one, it's revealed to us by his prayer life.

228
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,639
In verse number three, notice what Paul says,

229
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,239
that without ceasing, the end of the verse,

230
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:17,579
I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day.

231
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,859
Paul is praying for Timothy.

232
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,579
Why? Because he's concerned for Timothy.

233
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,659
Paul is praying, listen, you pray for the things that concern you.

234
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,859
You pray for the people that you're concerned about,

235
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,099
the people that you care about,

236
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,639
the people that you pray for, those people.

237
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,539
And Timothy is there in Ephesus,

238
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,079
and Paul is in prison awaiting a martyr's death.

239
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,919
And we find that Paul is writing this letter,

240
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,679
and he's saying to Timothy, I'm praying for you.

241
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,379
I'm ceasing not to pray day and night.

242
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,919
And we think about the way that that would, yes,

243
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,999
encourage Timothy, but you also note the concern of Paul

244
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,999
and understand that it's revealed to us through his prayers.

245
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,659
We find that it's revealed to us not only through the fact

246
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,239
that he's praying for Timothy, but in verse number four,

247
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:05,699
it's revealed to us because he desires to see him.

248
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:11,079
Notice in verse number four, greatly desiring to see thee.

249
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,279
You think about the idea,

250
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,819
Paul was a man that served the Lord with much adversity.

251
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,659
Paul was a man that faced great opposition.

252
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,519
And we find that Paul had experienced the comfort of God,

253
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,119
the encouragement from God, many times, yes,

254
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,719
directly from God, but you know that there were times

255
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,999
that God used people to encourage

256
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,199
and comfort the apostle Paul by their coming.

257
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,459
If you read 2 Corinthians, you find that he says

258
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,639
that they're overwhelmed, they got all these things going on

259
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,099
but they were comforted by the coming of Titus.

260
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:48,979
And Titus came, God sent Titus,

261
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:52,379
and God encouraged Paul through Titus coming.

262
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,339
In fact, next week, as we study the end of chapter number one

263
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,039
here of 2 Timothy, you read about a man

264
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,299
by the name of Anesiphorus.

265
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,079
The Bible says he oft refreshed me.

266
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,519
And we find here that Paul, he has this desire to go

267
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,239
and to see Timothy, to be with him, why?

268
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,219
Because he was concerned for him.

269
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,919
You ever have somebody that you're concerned for

270
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,519
and you say, man, I just wish I could go visit with them.

271
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,219
I wish I could go be with them.

272
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,119
Now, there are times in which maybe

273
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,699
the travel is not possible.

274
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,559
There's some number of miles that would separate us

275
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,739
from the person that we're concerned with

276
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,299
and where we are.

277
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,239
But we find that with technology today,

278
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,499
we can pick up a phone.

279
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,079
If you have a real smartphone,

280
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,739
you can do a video conference and all that type of thing.

281
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,279
And you can receive comfort,

282
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,639
but you can also comfort someone.

283
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,219
And we find that Paul, he says,

284
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,979
I noticed when he says greatly desiring to see thee, why?

285
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,219
Because I'm concerned about you.

286
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,299
I think about Paul and the role that he has

287
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:54,099
as being the mentor and influencing and investing

288
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,919
and making this deposit into the life of Timothy.

289
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,619
He wants to encourage Timothy,

290
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,659
but in so doing, he reveals to us this morning

291
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,539
that he has this great deal of concern

292
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,199
for his son in the faith.

293
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,039
He's concerned for him.

294
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,739
It's revealed to us by his prayers

295
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:10,979
as recorded in verse number three,

296
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,339
by his desire in verse number four to see him.

297
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,079
He says this, being mindful of thy tears,

298
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,479
that I may be filled with joy.

299
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,919
I want you to think about that.

300
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:25,319
He says, being mindful of thy tears.

301
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,819
We don't know, and Bible scholars disagree,

302
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:30,779
and they dispute it, whether Paul is referencing

303
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,479
the tears that were shed at the departure

304
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,459
from when Paul and Timothy last saw one another,

305
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,299
or if Paul's referring to the tears

306
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,399
that Timothy's shedding because of all

307
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,659
that he's dealing with.

308
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,059
You be the judge, maybe it's both.

309
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,899
And in fact, we find that,

310
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,419
as Timothy would be ministering there in Ephesus

311
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,559
and dealing with all the turmoil

312
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,659
and all the opposition and the false teaching

313
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,939
and all that's going on,

314
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:02,499
no doubt there were some times that he shed some tears.

315
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,939
Can I remind you what Paul says

316
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,539
to those same leaders of the church at Ephesus

317
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:07,939
in Acts chapter number 20?

318
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,719
He says that he was ministering day and night with tears.

319
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,819
With tears.

320
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,359
And so we find that, as Paul would shed some tears

321
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,479
because of the people he was trying to reach

322
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,919
and minister to and because of all that was going on,

323
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,099
no doubt Timothy as well was probably shedding some tears.

324
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,199
And Paul says that he was greatly desiring

325
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,559
to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,

326
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,940
but then notice the end of verse number four,

327
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,440
that I may be filled with joy.

328
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,339
And I begin to think about that statement

329
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,179
and how it would bring joy to Paul

330
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,440
to be able to be in the presence of Timothy,

331
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,919
to encourage him to see Timothy built up

332
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,879
and edified.

333
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,779
Listen, if God would use you to encourage somebody

334
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,779
because you're concerned about their spiritual being,

335
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,679
their spiritual growth, their faithfulness to God,

336
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,259
and you have the opportunity that God would use you

337
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,720
to be an encouragement to them,

338
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,559
man, that brings you joy.

339
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,299
Brings you joy.

340
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,259
And Paul says, I'm concerned.

341
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,759
I'm concerned.

342
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,500
It's revealed to us here in these few verses of scripture

343
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,299
through his prayers, through his desire.

344
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:16,979
Notice in verse number five and six,

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I believe that Paul reveals to us his concern for Timothy

346
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,279
by what he says, by his words of remembrance.

347
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,339
It says in verse number five, when I call to remembrance,

348
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,299
now understand that as Paul is very familiar with Timothy

349
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,419
and with Timothy's family,

350
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,819
that he begins to recollect some things.

351
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,139
He begins to remember some things

352
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,139
and he's going to reveal to Timothy these things

353
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,879
to yes, encourage him, but also to reveal to us his concern.

354
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,399
He says, when I call to remembrance,

355
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,440
the unfeigned faith, that word is interesting.

356
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,799
It means not to be counterfeit.

357
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,440
It means not hypocritical.

358
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,879
Really, as we think about this faith, it is a sincere faith.

359
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,119
It is real faith.

360
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,759
He says, unfeigned faith, notice,

361
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,919
which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois

362
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,179
and thy mother Eunice.

363
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,399
But then notice this, and I am persuaded that in thee also.

364
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,500
Timothy was a man of faith.

365
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,879
Timothy was a man that believed God.

366
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,720
But you know, there are some people,

367
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,319
we often use the terminology

368
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,579
of speaking about heroes of the faith.

369
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,239
There's some times that people's faith can be shaken.

370
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,319
You deal with adversity and opposition and it builds up

371
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,919
and it builds up and the turmoil and the trials

372
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,079
and all that comes, and if we're not careful,

373
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,000
that faith can be shaken.

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But Paul says, listen, I'm calling to remembrance.

375
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,679
There was some generational faith,

376
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,159
your grandmother, your mother,

377
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,519
but I'm persuaded that in thee also.

378
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,879
And Paul had this concern that Timothy would continue

379
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,440
and therefore, he says in verse number six,

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,199
wherefore, I put thee in remembrance,

381
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,440
notice what he says, that thou stir up the gift of God,

382
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,259
which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.

383
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,299
Now, we believe as you look here,

384
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,399
you look back in 1 Timothy chapter five

385
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,720
and there was mention of this as well

386
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,119
there in that text of scripture where it says,

387
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,519
lay hands suddenly on no man in chapter five in verse 22.

388
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,759
And we find that it was very common

389
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,000
and in fact, it's still practiced today

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,759
where you use that phraseology of laying hands on someone.

391
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,359
There's no transference of gift that comes through that,

392
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,639
but there's an acknowledgement

393
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,059
that God has called an individual.

394
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,559
You do that sometimes when you have an ordination service,

395
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,479
someone's gone through the ordination council,

396
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,679
they're being ordained to the ministry

397
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,239
and you'll pray over them or pray with them

398
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,720
and you'll lay hands on them.

399
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,479
And I remember when I was ordained,

400
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,279
I remember the deacons in our church

401
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,679
when I was in Pennsylvania before I came here to pastor,

402
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,399
the deacons in our church and our pastor,

403
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,039
they all got around me when I was on the altar

404
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,959
and they laid hands on me and they prayed.

405
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,000
And so what is Paul doing?

406
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,459
He's remembering, he's concerned for his son in the faith

407
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,539
and it's revealed to us by these opening statements

408
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,279
of what he's saying to Timothy.

409
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,119
And I just wonder this morning,

410
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,399
do we have any concern for our brothers and sisters

411
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,039
in Christ?

412
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
I wonder this morning if that concern

413
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,119
is revealed through compassion.

414
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,239
I wonder this morning if there's some people

415
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,559
that were concerned about them.

416
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,759
I mean, they're dealing with some struggles,

417
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,000
they're overwhelmed and they're dealing with some adversity

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,039
and some opposition and I wonder, are we praying for them?

419
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm wondering, do we have that desire to go see them,

420
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,239
to be in their presence as Paul says in verse number four,

421
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,880
greatly desiring to see thee.

422
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,119
Listen, my desire and your desire for our brothers

423
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,880
and sisters in Christ ought to be that we walk worthy,

424
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
that we please God, that you see somebody that's missing,

425
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
somebody that's not here,

426
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,979
somebody that you haven't seen in a while.

427
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,839
Hey, you pray for them, you pick up a phone

428
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,519
and you call them, you go and you visit them

429
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,919
and you find out, hey, how are you doing?

430
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,359
Why?

431
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,559
Because we're concerned.

432
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,959
You know we live in a wicked world.

433
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,739
You know that this right here is a safe place,

434
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,359
the church house, it's a place where you can come

435
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,239
and we can be encouraged and we can,

436
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,519
man, somebody might ask you in this place,

437
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,959
how's your Bible reading and what's the Lord doing

438
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,500
in your life and how's God answering your prayers

439
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,760
and you can be encouraged, but you know what?

440
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,159
You leave this place and you're out in the world

441
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,959
and it's a dirty world, it's a wicked world.

442
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,799
It's a world that's against God.

443
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,599
Do I have to belabor that point

444
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,839
or do we just all acknowledge it?

445
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,479
It's a world that's against God.

446
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,479
Not only against God, but against God's people.

447
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,479
The world hates Christians,

448
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,599
but the world hates Christians because they hate Christ.

449
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,159
You have to understand that.

450
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,279
Jesus said, if they hate you,

451
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,119
remember, they hated me. Right? That's what he told us. And so we find here this morning

452
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,739
that we have an enemy. You're not the only one that has an enemy. Every one of your brothers

453
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:15,219
and sisters in Christ have an enemy. And guess what the enemy is doing in your life but also

454
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:23,059
what the enemy is doing in their life is seeking whom he may devour. Is that not true? And

455
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,019
we ought to have concern one for another. We ought to understand this thing that we

456
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,619
see here as Paul is saying, listen, I have this concern. Why? Because I don't want you

457
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:38,899
to be devoured by the enemy. I don't want you to quit. I don't want you to give up.

458
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:43,419
I want you to continue. I want you to please God with your life. I want you, notice what

459
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,939
Paul says, hold your place here, but turn back to the book of Colossians, if you will.

460
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:51,039
And I want you to see what Paul says in Colossians chapter number one. And this is so important

461
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,899
as we understand Paul's mindset in ministry with regard to those that God would allow

462
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:03,339
him to minister to. And Paul says this, remember, Paul never was in Colossae. He didn't start

463
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:08,859
the church in Colossae. He didn't know these believers in Colossae. He simply heard about

464
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,179
them because Epaphras brought word and he heard about them and he was rejoicing. You

465
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,939
read the beginning of chapter number one. I mean, he's rejoicing and he's thanking God

466
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:25,059
for these believers in Colossae and he's praying that they would be spiritually mature and

467
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,059
they would grow and they would be used of God. It's amazing, we don't have time to look

468
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,779
at the details of the prayer in verses nine through 14, but it is powerful. But at the

469
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:38,859
end of the text of scripture, notice in verse 28, what Paul says, whom we preach warning

470
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:45,859
every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ

471
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:53,099
Jesus. Why does Paul have that as his motive, as his concern? Well, because he knows that

472
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:59,179
every child of God, every believer is going to stand before Christ at the Bena seat, at

473
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,179
the judgment seat of Christ, and his desire, not only for himself, but for those that he

474
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:09,379
ministered to, those that he had an opportunity to influence, was that they may be able to

475
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:15,739
stand perfect in Christ Jesus. Now understand, that's dealing with being complete. That's

476
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:22,739
having the idea of being, walking in a worthy manner. And that's Paul's desire. And he's

477
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:30,259
concerned. And Paul had a concern for Timothy. I'm sure that this morning, all of us know

478
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:38,499
someone who stopped serving God. All of us know someone, who for whatever reason, stopped

479
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:49,259
serving God. They just quit, they gave up, the pressures were too much, the enemy brought

480
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:54,859
some temptations and they fell in sin. Whatever the circumstances, but they're not serving

481
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:01,859
God today. I wonder this morning, how does that affect you? It ought to break our hearts.

482
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:06,419
Break our hearts. We ought to be concerned one for another. But our concern for one another

483
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:13,419
should be well before they fall out. Amen? We see it here, Paul's concern. Number two,

484
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:20,379
not only do we see Paul's concern for Timothy, but we see this in verses 7-12, Paul's confidence

485
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,619
in the Lord. And I love this portion of scripture because we see that Paul, as much as he's

486
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,699
concerned for Timothy, he's got this great confidence in the Lord. Listen, you can be

487
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,139
concerned for your brothers and sisters in Christ, and you should be, but you've got

488
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:36,739
to point them to Christ. And you've got to understand that Christ is the one that can

489
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:42,219
do a work. Christ is the one that can make the difference in the life of that individual

490
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:46,259
and that brother or sister in Christ. He's the one that's made the difference in our

491
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,019
lives. We've got to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. We find

492
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:57,779
in verse 7, for God hath not given us the spirit of fear, no, but of power and of love

493
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:03,539
and of a sound mind. And so Paul begins to reveal here the provision of God in verse

494
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:10,259
number 7. What has God given to his children so that in the midst of this wicked and perverse

495
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:15,779
generation, in the midst of these last days when perilous times shall come, when evil

496
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,779
men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, we read that in the third chapter of this

497
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:26,099
letter, how is it that we can continue? How is it that we can not give up and not give

498
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:32,459
in? Well, we understand the provision of God. He has given us, we find, he's not given to

499
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:40,619
us the spirit of fear. Listen, we're not to fear what man can do unto us. Amen? Hebrews

500
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:48,099
13, the Lord, the Bible says that he said he would never leave us nor forsake us so

501
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:55,099
that we might say, I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Listen, greater is he that

502
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:01,379
is in you than he that is in the world. Hallelujah. That we understand the provision of God. He's

503
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:05,459
not given us the spirit of fear. Listen, it ought not be that God's people are running

504
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:12,579
around being afraid. God's given us his word. You understand this morning he's on his throne.

505
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:17,059
You say, Pastor, you see the news. I saw all kinds of things in the news this week. But

506
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,059
you know what you didn't see in the news but we know to be true is that God's on his throne.

507
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:28,739
There is no headline that you read this week that said God was on the throne. Am I right?

508
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,739
Can I tell you this morning, God's on his throne. He's on his throne. He rules and he

509
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:38,219
reigns. And we find he's not given us the spirit of fear but notice as it says in verse

510
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:47,339
number three, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. We find that as we saturate

511
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:52,739
our minds with God's word, as we get into the book, listen, here's what I find as I,

512
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:56,299
all these things that are coming down the pike, all the news headlines, you know what's

513
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,259
going on? People like to say that the world's falling apart. Things are just falling in

514
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:07,779
place. The hour's near. The hour's near. Hallelujah. But there's a lot of work to be done. Listen,

515
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,059
don't be overwhelmed with fear. The devil wants you to be afraid. The enemy wants you

516
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:17,699
to be afraid. But God, his provision is that he's not given to us the spirit of fear but

517
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:25,459
he's given to us love and power and a sound mind. Hallelujah. I think about Samuel. As

518
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:30,259
Samuel was there and he was hearing the call of God and he wasn't familiar with the voice

519
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:34,859
of God. He had no idea. And he runs in to see Eli because he thinks that's, who's calling

520
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,939
him? He thinks Eli's calling him. And it happens multiple times and Eli finally recognized

521
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:43,139
what's going on and he says, listen, when you hear your name called again, say, speak

522
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:50,379
Lord for thy servant heareth. You know, Samuel goes and lays down and God calls again and

523
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:54,619
Samuel responds that way. And it's interesting in the text of scripture what God says he's

524
00:26:54,619 --> 00:27:00,259
going to show him things that are going to come. Things are going to come. You know God's

525
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:03,779
given us a Bible and he's revealed to us things that are going to come. We don't have to have

526
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,459
a spirit of fear. Listen, if we didn't have a Bible I could understand being afraid. Honestly.

527
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:12,739
If I didn't know the Lord, if I didn't know the Lord and I didn't have his word, I could

528
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:16,699
be afraid with all these things going on in our society. But oh, God's not giving us the

529
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:21,259
spirit of fear. We see that Paul is confident in the Lord because of God's provision. I

530
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,699
find in verse number eight that Paul is confident in the Lord because of God's power. Notice

531
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:30,259
in verse eight, be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his

532
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:39,499
prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.

533
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:43,499
Listen this morning, you understand that God has all power. He doesn't just have most power.

534
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:49,959
He has all power. The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. All power is given unto me in heaven

535
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:57,919
and in earth. I am the Lord God almighty. That's what God said to Abraham. We find this

536
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,119
morning that we need to have confidence in the Lord. Why? Well, because his provision,

537
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:06,959
but also because of his power. Listen, when I know the God of the universe that is my

538
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:13,599
God, my savior, that he has all power, man, I can have confidence in him. I ought to live

539
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,199
in confidence. We find that he mentions in the next verse, verse number nine, the purpose

540
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:23,559
of God who has saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,

541
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,039
but according, notice what it says, to his own purpose and grace, which was given us

542
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:35,679
in Christ Jesus before the world began. I'm thankful that God has a purpose. Aren't you

543
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,519
glad that God has a purpose? Every time God moves, do you understand that God moves with

544
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,719
purpose? You ever do something or maybe somebody else does something, you say, what was the

545
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:50,599
purpose of doing that? Why did you do that? Something happened the other day and there

546
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:58,599
were some kids being kids in the hotel lobby and they were being rambunctious and whatever

547
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,759
and something happened and I said, well, what happened over there? What was the purpose

548
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,079
of that? One guy said, they're just being stupid. I was like, well, okay, I get it,

549
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:13,679
but what was the purpose? Why were you doing that? The reality is that our God always moves

550
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,719
with purpose. He always moves with purpose. You might not today understand the purpose

551
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:27,679
of what God's doing, but can I tell you that you must rest in knowing that God has a purpose.

552
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,599
You say, but what about this thing? What about that thing? What's going on? God has a purpose.

553
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,359
Do you know that God's world and God's view is a whole lot bigger than any of us? I understand

554
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,679
this morning that God is at work, that God is doing things and he's moving and God has

555
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,159
a view that is far better and far higher than what any of us can see. And there are

556
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,119
times that God will move over here because he's going to try to accomplish something

557
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,419
over here. And God has a purpose in all of it. And we may not, from our vantage point,

558
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:00,319
we may not understand it, but we

559
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,479
We must rest in the fact that the omnipotent, omniscient God has a purpose.

560
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,359
He has a purpose in your life.

561
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,719
He has a purpose in my life.

562
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,999
And we find that he moves with purpose.

563
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,919
He says, according to his own purpose.

564
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,399
In verses 10 through 12, we see the confidence that Paul has in the Lord because of the plan

565
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:22,399
of God.

566
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,719
And these two things, the purpose and plan, are obviously closely associated.

567
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:32,439
Notice in verse 10, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior, Jesus Christ.

568
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:39,159
Notice what he did, who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light

569
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,159
through the gospel.

570
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,659
Aren't you thankful for the plan of God with regard to redemption?

571
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:48,519
What he did, listen, in the ages past, the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the lamb that

572
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,079
was slain before the foundation of the world.

573
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,999
God who knows all things, he knew that he would create man in a perfect environment.

574
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:01,559
He knew that he'd create them sinless and perfect, but he knew they would fall and he

575
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,959
knew that they would need redemption.

576
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,599
They would need a savior.

577
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:09,039
And Jesus Christ, the lamb of God that was slain, according to what Peter says before

578
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,539
the foundation of the world, listen, Ephesians deals with it as Paul would minister to those

579
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,079
believers in Ephesus.

580
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,959
In Ephesians chapter one, it talks about the plan of God with regard to salvation.

581
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,239
The plan of redemption.

582
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:27,559
We understand that Ephesians one, it's not talking about the who of salvation, but the

583
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,279
how of salvation.

584
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,839
And what God determined before the foundation of the world is not so much who was going

585
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,199
to be saved, even though he knew who was going to be saved, he didn't predetermine that.

586
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:42,879
What he predetermined was how man would be saved.

587
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:46,079
You know something that's amazing today, that if we were to take the time and we were to

588
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,279
go through each individual that's here, if you are saved by the grace of God, if you're

589
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,199
heaven bound, you know for sure that heaven is your home.

590
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:57,479
You've been born again, that if we took the time and we start here with Tim and every

591
00:31:57,479 --> 00:32:01,279
single person that's saved by the grace of God gives a testimony and it ends over here

592
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,759
with Joseph, do you know that every one of us have the same way that we got saved?

593
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:12,839
Because there's only one way to be saved, through Jesus Christ, amen.

594
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,839
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

595
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,919
No man cometh unto the father but by me, neither is there salvation in any other.

596
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,399
There's only one name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

597
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,839
The circumstances of your salvation testimony are going to vary from person to person, but

598
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:39,239
the reality is that every single one of us, the how is the same, through Jesus Christ.

599
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:45,739
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, amen.

600
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,039
God has no grandchildren, He only has children.

601
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,919
You talk to somebody, I don't know why my mommy, my daddy, they're saved, they're Christians,

602
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,739
that's not how it works.

603
00:32:54,739 --> 00:33:00,639
You don't, it doesn't pass through your parents' bloodline, amen.

604
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:07,159
Sin passes through the blood, but you've got to come to Christ personally.

605
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,879
And He says, look at what Christ did, who hath abolished death, aren't you thankful

606
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:15,799
that He conquered sin, death, and the grave?

607
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,199
He's alive forevermore, hallelujah.

608
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:23,199
Verse 11, we talk about the plan of God, we're unto, I am appointed a preacher.

609
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:29,599
So now Paul's talking about his own ministry and God's will for his own life, I'm appointed

610
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,159
a preacher and apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.

611
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,519
And we find that Paul mentioned that in verse number one in his introduction, and he's reminding

612
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,959
himself but also Timothy, and he's demonstrating to us his confidence that he has in God, that

613
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:50,279
God has a plan for his life, God has a plan for your life.

614
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,239
For the witch calls, verse number 12, I also suffer these things.

615
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:58,039
Can I tell you that the sufferings that come are ordained by God as well?

616
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,399
He's allowed them, he's allowed them.

617
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,879
The psalmist said this, he said, I'm glad I rejoiced that I was afflicted.

618
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,279
Why?

619
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,439
Because then I learned thy statutes.

620
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:13,859
Paul understood that these, listen, he says in just a couple of chapters, yea, all those

621
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,219
that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

622
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,259
He says to the believers in Thessalonica, in 1st Thessalonians, he's writing to them

623
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:26,259
and he says, listen, you're suffering, but remember I told you you'd suffer.

624
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:30,179
And so we find that he talks about these sufferings, he says, for the witch calls I also suffer

625
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,399
these things, because he was serving God, because he was faithfully doing what God called

626
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,139
him to do, he was suffering.

627
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,779
He was not suffering as an evildoer, Peter deals with that.

628
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:46,659
Listen, if you're suffering as an evildoer, that's on you.

629
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,059
But if you're suffering for the cause of Christ, then happy are ye, blessed, blessed are ye.

630
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,419
Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, is that not what Peter says in 1 Peter

631
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:58,979
chapter 4?

632
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:03,899
And we find that we understand that Paul, he's saying, listen, nevertheless, even though

633
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:07,979
I'm dealing with these things, I'm in prison, I'm going to face a martyr's death, all of

634
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:11,419
these things, these sufferings, listen, I am not ashamed.

635
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:12,539
I'm not ashamed.

636
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:18,939
Listen, I hope this morning that we'll never be ashamed of Jesus.

637
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:22,059
Paul said in Romans 1 and verse 16, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is

638
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:26,619
the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first and also

639
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:27,619
to the Greek.

640
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:33,499
But here he says, listen, I'm suffering these things, but I'm not ashamed, for I know whom

641
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:36,659
I have believed and am persuaded.

642
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:41,099
Listen, you couldn't talk Paul out of it, you couldn't change his mind.

643
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:47,619
You couldn't torture him to the place of denying his Lord, he's not ashamed.

644
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:56,139
I know whom I have believed, I have confidence, I have confidence, I am persuaded that he

645
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,139
is able.

646
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:02,619
Listen, I'm weak, you're weak, but our God is not.

647
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:08,619
He is able, notice what he says, to keep that which I have committed unto him against that

648
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:10,979
day.

649
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:13,659
I don't know.

650
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,779
People talk about it all the time.

651
00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:17,859
Are we going to suffer persecution in America?

652
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,499
I can't answer the question.

653
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:21,579
I would say, why not?

654
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,699
That's my answer.

655
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:23,899
Why not?

656
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:31,019
What makes us as a nation anything more special than any other people?

657
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:34,899
You know, there are great people all across the globe that are saved by the grace of God

658
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:42,499
that are suffering great persecution all over the world.

659
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:51,139
We have been spared for our life to not suffer persecution here in America.

660
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:55,579
But I can tell you this morning that if the persecution comes, we ought to be able to

661
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,959
stand and say, I'm not ashamed.

662
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,299
I know whom I have believed.

663
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,899
I'm going to see them face-to-face one day.

664
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:07,579
And I don't know all that might befall us, but I know one thing is true, that our God

665
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:08,579
is able.

666
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,579
And that we're not going to, listen, we're not going to turn our back on him.

667
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:16,539
We're not going to, the pressure's mount, listen, it's been easy in America to be a

668
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:17,539
Christian.

669
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,139
It has been.

670
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,139
Am I not right?

671
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:24,219
It's been easy in America to be a Christian.

672
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:27,019
No one disowns you in America when you trust in Christ.

673
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,179
I'm not going to, oh, somebody closed the door on me.

674
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,179
Somebody cussed me out.

675
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:39,059
That is nothing compared to what people face in other parts of the world, nothing.

676
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,259
There are people that give up and quit because of some minor pressures.

677
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:48,259
Oh, no, there's got to be something in us that says, I have confidence in my God.

678
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,459
I have confidence in his provision.

679
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:56,019
I have confidence in his power, in his purpose, and in his plan.

680
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:01,619
Paul, in these verses, he reveals to us his concern for Timothy, but he reveals to us

681
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,859
his confidence in the Lord.

682
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,819
Finally this morning, number three, Paul's charge to Timothy.

683
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:12,539
In verses 13 through 15, we see that Paul issues this charge to Timothy.

684
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:17,939
After it, with regard to the background, the backdrop of seeing what has been said in verses

685
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:22,219
3 through 12, we find that Paul is going to issue this charge.

686
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:23,859
It says this in verse 13.

687
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:48,779
Now, in these few verses of Scripture, this charge, I'm just going to highlight kind of

688
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:50,619
a thought from each one.

689
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,059
Number one from verse number 13, hold fast.

690
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,059
Hold fast.

691
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:58,419
I like the words that God uses there.

692
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,059
Hold fast.

693
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,379
What is it that he's talking about?

694
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:06,619
Well, he says, hold fast the form of sound words.

695
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:12,579
Now remember, we cannot take 2 Timothy independent of what we've studied in 1 Timothy.

696
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:17,979
It's important to understand the continuation, the second letter going and still Timothy

697
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:19,739
serving there in Ephesus.

698
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,059
He talks to him in the first chapter of 1 Timothy about these false teachers and he

699
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:30,659
talks about them coming in, that they're teaching some other doctrine, that they're giving heed

700
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:36,659
to fables and endless genealogies, that they're ministering questions and there's no edification.

701
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:43,579
He's talking to them about these words that he talks about being vain jangling or useless

702
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:44,579
talk.

703
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:51,059
And he goes through all that but he says that we're to be concerned with sound doctrine.

704
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,899
Sound doctrine.

705
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:58,939
We find that he goes through in chapter number 4 quite extensively dealing with the fact

706
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,419
of our spirit.

707
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:03,619
diet, what is it that we're taking, and what Timothy's

708
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,859
responsibility is. He talks to him about the deception of the

709
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:09,419
false teachers and all that would take place in the latter

710
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:12,499
days and the latter times. He tells him in verse 6 of 1

711
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:15,659
Timothy chapter number 4, If thou put the brethren in

712
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:18,999
remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister

713
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,939
of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of

714
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:27,439
good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. He says this in

715
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,839
verse number 16, Take heed unto thyself and unto the

716
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,639
doctrine, continuing them, for in doing this thou shalt both

717
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:41,239
save thyself and them that hear thee. And so Paul now says to

718
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,919
Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 1, Hold fast the form of

719
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:53,599
sound words. Listen, I don't care the size of the church, the

720
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,999
popularity of the individual. If they bring some teaching that

721
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:03,139
is contrary to what God says in His Word, we must reject it. We

722
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:09,879
absolutely must hold fast to sound words. Why do you believe

723
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:12,939
what you believe? Because the Bible says and we give our

724
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:17,419
answer. Amen? As Baptist people we've said historically, one of

725
00:41:17,419 --> 00:41:22,159
our distinctives is that as a Baptist we believe in the sole

726
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:27,259
authority of the Bible for faith and practice. The Bible is our

727
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,859
sole authority for faith and practice. What does that mean?

728
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:36,759
It's our only authority, sole authority for faith and for

729
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:40,299
practice. We ought to be able to go to the Bible. Why do you

730
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:43,199
believe that? Well, can I show you why I believe that? Let me

731
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,799
show you these verses of Scripture. Here's why I believe

732
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,239
that. And by the way, the best commentary in the Bible is the

733
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,399
Bible. Compare Scripture with Scripture. No Scriptures of any

734
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:56,239
private interpretation, right? We're to compare Scripture with

735
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,579
Scripture. Listen, we're to be students of the book. You know,

736
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,479
Baptists at one point were called people of the book. By

737
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,579
the way, it was meant to be derogatory, but what a

738
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:13,119
compliment. People of the book, hallelujah. It's God's book.

739
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,419
Amen? Notice what Paul says. Hold fast in verse number 13 of

740
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:21,439
chapter 1 of 2 Timothy, the form of sound words, notice,

741
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:25,979
which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in

742
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:28,259
Christ Jesus. Now, I want you to understand that. You don't

743
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,759
need to turn over, but I want to read to you from Galatians

744
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,319
chapter number 1, because Paul says of what you've heard from

745
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,299
me, but I want you to understand that Paul gives this truth in

746
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,239
Galatians 1 and verse number 11, but I certify you, brethren,

747
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,399
that the gospel which was preached of me is not after

748
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:46,339
man. Oh, well, that's just what Paul said. No, no. Paul said

749
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,399
himself, it's not after man, for I neither received it of

750
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:53,059
man, neither was I taught it by, but by the revelation of Jesus

751
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:57,179
Christ. All right? So, it's important that we understand

752
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,539
when Paul says the things that thou hast heard of me among many

753
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:02,279
witnesses in chapter 2 and verse number 2, Paul's not saying

754
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,179
just follow me as, no, no, he's saying follow me as I follow

755
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:08,119
Christ. I'm not giving you something that just came from

756
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,679
man. No, I was taught this. It came by the revelation of Jesus

757
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:16,499
Christ. What a joy. So, Paul says in this charge number 1,

758
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:20,699
hold fast. Hold fast what? Sound words. You ever been in a

759
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,179
situation where you're holding on for dear life? You know what

760
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:26,239
I'm talking about? Every time I get on a roller coaster, I'm

761
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,179
holding on for dear life. I absolutely hate roller coasters.

762
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:32,619
I absolutely hate them. I haven't been on one in years. I

763
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,219
don't plan to ever go on one again. The last couple of times

764
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,499
I've been on the theme parks, I pay the ticket to get in, which

765
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:39,859
is stupid because it's expensive, and I just eat some

766
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:42,479
of the food, amen? It's wonderful. I don't go on any of

767
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:44,519
the rides. If there's a water ride, I'll go on that, you know,

768
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,959
like it's not too dangerous. But man, I got on a ride one time.

769
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,059
I was at King's Dominion, and it was the last time I was there,

770
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:53,399
and I got on this ride, and I don't even remember what ride it

771
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:55,559
was, but I got in that thing, and I held on to that thing. My

772
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,439
knuckles were white. Everyone wasn't even in yet. I'm telling

773
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:01,759
you, I was sitting there. I was scared to death, and this lady

774
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:03,839
was over here, and there was this little kid in between. This

775
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,879
little kid was probably 8, 9 years old, just tall enough to

776
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:10,099
get on there, and the mom said, would you please relax? You're

777
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,339
making my son nervous. He can get another seat, man, because

778
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,539
there is no relaxing. Brother Tony, you understand. You can

779
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:19,179
relate, amen? You're with me, okay? Listen, there's no

780
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:22,939
relaxing. I was holding on for dear life, and I scream like a

781
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:26,259
girl when I'm on a roller coaster. No shame. I'm just

782
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:30,379
telling the truth. Am I not telling the truth? I'm telling

783
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:38,019
you, man, I hate them. I think about that hold fast. Listen,

784
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:40,979
we're not going to let go. We don't have a light grip on what

785
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:45,199
God's in His Word. I'm holding on. I don't matter what anyone

786
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,519
says. It doesn't matter the size of the ministry, the prominence

787
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:54,319
of the man. I got God's Word, amen? Number two, he says this

788
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,559
in verse number 14, keep. Keep what? Notice he says, that good

789
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:03,259
thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost

790
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:07,059
which dwelleth in us. By the way, at the moment of salvation,

791
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:10,339
the Holy Spirit of God took up residence in your life. He is

792
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:13,859
the earnest of our inheritance. What a joy that we're sealed

793
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:16,939
under the day of redemption. And we find that he says, keep

794
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:20,739
that good thing which was committed unto thee. And God has

795
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:24,739
given to us this opportunity. And Paul is giving this charge.

796
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:28,459
And he says, hold fast. He says, keep. In verse number 15, I

797
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:31,519
believe that what he's saying here is continue. Where do I get

798
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,819
that from? Well, I believe it's evidenced by the behavior of

799
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:39,519
those in Asia that turned away. He says in verse 15, this thou

800
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,439
knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me,

801
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:49,079
of whom are figellus and hermogenes. And we find that

802
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,639
there is that turning away. But no, Timothy, when he gives this

803
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,599
charge, hold fast, keep, and continue. You know that

804
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:00,099
sometimes when other people turn away, we can be influenced to

805
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:03,819
turn away as well. It says all those that were in Asia. It's

806
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:06,699
interesting. We don't have time to develop all of it. But in

807
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:10,059
Acts chapter 19, Paul is ministering there. And the Bible

808
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,139
tells us about his ministry, not only in Ephesus, we find it in

809
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:17,979
verse number 1, that he came to the coast of Ephesus. But we

810
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:21,099
find that he was there and he was ministering. We find that

811
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,739
the Bible tells us in verse 10 that this continued by the

812
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:29,639
space of two years, so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard

813
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:32,999
the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. And understand

814
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:39,039
that's Asia minor, modern-day Turkey area of the world. And he

815
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,039
says that they heard, but now he's saying in chapter 1 of 2

816
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,959
Timothy, they've turned away. This morning, Paul reveals to us

817
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:52,879
this concern that he has for Timothy. He's concerned for him.

818
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:55,179
I don't want you to give up. I don't want you to become

819
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:58,459
overwhelmed. I don't want you to give in to the pressures. I want

820
00:46:58,459 --> 00:47:02,739
you to remember some things. And Paul is saying, my concern is

821
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,139
revealed to the fact that I'm praying for you. I wish I could

822
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:08,659
come see you, but I'm in prison. I can't come see you, but I long

823
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:14,299
to be with you. I greatly desire to see you. I wonder this

824
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:18,459
morning, there's somebody that you're concerned about, somebody

825
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:23,759
that you're praying for, somebody that's struggling. You

826
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,759
know, the reality is that sometimes people don't like

827
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,959
sharing all of their struggles. Now, some people share too many

828
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,439
struggles. You understand what I mean? There's like one end or

829
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:34,779
the other end of the spectrum. Some people share nothing. Some

830
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:37,559
people share everything. Very rarely do you find somebody kind

831
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,839
of in the middle. But you understand that we all deal with

832
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:45,799
struggles. We all deal with struggles. We need to pray one

833
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:50,219
way or another. Somebody we're concerned about. Listen, I don't

834
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:52,819
want them to become a casualty. I don't want them to become a

835
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:57,219
casualty. I want to see them finish the race. I want to see

836
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:00,499
them finish strong. I want to see them be used of God to do

837
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,819
what God has equipped them to do. Paul says, I have confidence

838
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:09,379
in God. How confident are you in the Lord? I'm not talking about

839
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:13,579
just saying I'm confident. I'm talking about living like you're

840
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,599
confident in the Lord. It's one thing to say it, but I'm talking

841
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,879
about living it. Not being tossed to and fro. Not worrying

842
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:22,079
and fretting and being fearful and all these things. Did you

843
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,079
see this? Did you see that? What about this? What about that? No,

844
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,359
no, no. Remember, keep your eyes on Jesus. He's on His throne.

845
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:33,599
God has all power. He's provided for us what we need. He has a

846
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,759
purpose and He has a plan and we have confidence in the Lord. And

847
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:41,039
then I think about this charge to Timothy. Yes, I understand

848
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,399
contextually it's given specifically to Timothy, but by

849
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:47,599
way of application this morning, I wonder how we would receive

850
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:55,279
the charge. Hold fast, keep, continue. I wonder this morning,

851
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:59,979
are we determined? Because I know whom I have believed. Are

852
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,459
we determined that we're going to, by God's grace and with

853
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:04,719
God's help, we're just going to keep, we're going to hold fast,

854
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,359
we're going to keep on, we're going to continue, we're going

855
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,659
to serve Jesus until He calls us home. Amen? The Bible asks

856
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,019
this question, will the Son of Man find faith? Will He find

857
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:21,659
faith? John says this in 1 John that there will be some that

858
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,699
will be ashamed of Him at His appearing. But God says we're to

859
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,579
occupy until He comes. He says we're to redeem the time because

860
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,039
the days are evil. And I wonder this morning, listen, God never

861
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,079
said it was going to be easy, but He said He'd be with us.

862
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:40,639
Hallelujah. You know life's not easy for lost people either, but

863
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:46,839
they don't have Jesus. Amen? We've got the Lord Jesus Christ,

864
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:52,259
we've got the Holy Spirit of God that lives within us. Paul says,

865
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:57,519
for I know whom I have believed. It was regularly on His heart,

866
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:58,399
two things.

867
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:06,519
saved and I'm going to see him face to face. And those two things absolutely influenced

868
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:13,899
every day of his life and what he did and how he lived and how he served because he

869
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:17,619
knew he was saved and he knew he was going to see Christ face to face. And I hope this

870
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:24,559
morning that we too, every day of our lives, are mindful of those two things. You say,

871
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,919
Pastor, I'm not saved. I don't know that heaven is my home. Today is the day of salvation.

872
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:31,599
You come to this old-fashioned altar, take a Bible and say, I know for sure that heaven

873
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,199
is your home. Do not leave here without knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Say, Pastor,

874
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,639
I've been saved by the grace of God. You're going to see him face to face one day. By

875
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:46,439
the way, that brings great joy but it also causes us to tremble. It's amazing how that

876
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:52,599
works. Great joy. I long to see him face to face but I know I'm going to stand before

877
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:59,599
him. Receive reward or suffer loss, the Bible says. This morning, I know whom I have believed.

878
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:08,759
Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. I

879
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:15,519
thank you for this portion of scripture that challenges me, that challenges us. God, I

880
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,119
pray that we would do business with you this morning as we have a moment of invitation.

881
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:26,039
Lord, I pray that you'd have your will and way in the lives of those that are gathered.

882
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:32,839
Lord, that you'd help us to respond in obedience. Help us to determine to be doers of the word

883
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,719
and not hearers only. We'll give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do. For it's

884
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,119
in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

885
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,319
I have a moment of invitation. Allow you to respond to the Lord this morning. Maybe you

886
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,919
want to come to the altar. The altar is open. Maybe you want to make your pew at the altar.

887
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:51,519
You can pray right there where you are. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
