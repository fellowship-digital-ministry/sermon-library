WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
at verses three through 15.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.960
Last week, we looked at verses one and two

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.840
as we got into the second letter

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.119
that Paul is being allowed of the Lord

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.600
to write to his son in the faith, Timothy.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.939
Of course, our theme for this calendar year is continue.

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.800
We studied through first Timothy

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.440
and now studying through second Timothy.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.799
And with the Lord's help,

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:23.319
we'll finish this book as well during this calendar year.

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.959
And Paul was transformed on the road to Damascus.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.959
We understand his encounter with Jesus

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:34.479
was always fresh on his mind.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.000
His life was radically changed on that day

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.759
and he was living for the one who died for him.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.319
I think about the Apostle Paul

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.040
and we understand as God would use him

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.180
to write so much of our New Testament as the human penman,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.840
we know that all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.360
but as God would see fit to use the Apostle Paul

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.720
and we understand that his conversion

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.560
as it's recorded for us in Acts 9

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.680
was always fresh on his mind.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.779
I think another thought or truth

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:08.440
that was always fresh on his mind

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.239
was the fact that he knew

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:13.239
that one day he would stand before Jesus.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.639
He understood that one day he would stand

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.879
before his Lord and his Savior.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.480
And I believe that the Apostle Paul

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.379
had a great desire to please his Lord.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.059
We find that in verse number three of our text of scripture

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:29.599
he talks about serving the Lord with pure conscience.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.940
We find that his service to God

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.620
as we study through the missionary journeys

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.500
as they're recorded for us in the book of Acts,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.639
as we have the opportunity to read the epistles

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.279
that he wrote and we get some glimpse into his heart

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.500
and his ministry, his heart for the Lord,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.779
his heart for people,

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:52.779
and we find that he desired to please God with his life.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.099
I believe that Paul desired to serve the Lord

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.339
right up until the very last moment

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:01.980
with whatever opportunity God would give him.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.739
Paul was one of those guys

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.379
that was seizing the opportunity.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.419
He did not want opportunities to pass him by.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.539
He was actively looking for those opportunities

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.699
to serve the Lord, to share the gospel,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.419
to influence, to impact someone.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.380
He knew as we mentioned last week

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.460
as we enter in to this letter,

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.380
to Timothy, 2 Timothy,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.259
Paul knew that he would soon see his Savior face to face.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.059
What a glorious truth.

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.139
You know, I don't know,

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.059
you don't know when we're going to die.

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.160
We, of course, speak often

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.759
and we're looking for the soon return

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.740
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.039
We're looking, listening for the trumpet

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.619
and the reality is that we don't know

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.460
the time of our departure.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.500
We don't know when we'll take our final breath here

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.300
on this earth, but what a joy it is to know

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.339
that we will see our Savior face to face.

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.699
As the songwriter said, it will be worth it all.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.759
Everything that you've done for Christ,

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:07.979
every act of service, everything that you do for Christ,

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.619
it will be worth it all.

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.100
You will not regret serving Christ

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.259
and I'm so thankful that as Paul

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.699
is nearing the end of his earthly life,

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.100
as he's knowing that he'll soon see

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.779
his Savior face to face,

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.720
I believe that in this letter,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.940
if we could use this analogy this morning,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.699
that Paul desired to make a final deposit

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.820
into the life of Timothy.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.899
I believe that just as Paul had as his own life goal

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.139
to finish my course with joy,

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.339
he says that in Acts chapter number 20,

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.619
we find that in the context of making that comment,

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.460
he's telling that to the church leaders at Ephesus.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.020
Remember, that's the same place

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.380
where Timothy is now serving the Lord in Ephesus

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.979
and Paul desired that he would finish his course with joy.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.500
It's not gonna happen on accident.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.899
It's not gonna happen by chance.

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.520
You have to be purposed

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.699
if you're gonna finish your course with joy

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.660
and I believe that just as Paul had that desire for himself

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.139
that he also had that desire for those

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.639
to whom he ministered.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.199
He understood that he would see his Savior face to face

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.600
but every person that he ministered to,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.799
every person that God gave him the opportunity

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.619
to impact and to influence,

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:26.239
he knew that they too would see Christ face to face

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:29.239
and he desired that they would please the Lord,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:30.799
that they would finish strong,

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:35.799
that they would complete the work that God gave to them.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.359
Paul understood, we mentioned it last week,

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:40.720
he understood God's will for his life.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.279
He understood God's purpose in his life

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.160
and he was seeking to fulfill it

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.959
but as we look at the text this morning,

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.200
he understood that God had a plan and a purpose

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.279
and a will for Timothy as well

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.200
and he desired that Timothy would finish his race,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.040
that Timothy would complete with joy

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.359
the work that God would give him.

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:04.359
Verse 12 is a very familiar verse of scripture.

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:07.760
In fact, it's the memory verse for the month of August.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.600
I'm gonna read that verse and we'll jump right in.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.480
It's where I get the title for the message this morning.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.920
Notice in 2 Timothy 1 and verse 12,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.220
for the which cause I also suffer these things.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.519
Nevertheless, I am not ashamed

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.500
for I know whom I have believed

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.500
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.940
which I have committed unto him against that day.

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:37.959
You know, it's interesting in verse number 12,

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.579
it summarizes all that I just told you

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:41.839
by way of introduction.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.519
Paul was always fresh on his mind, his conversion

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.920
and he says here in verse number 12,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.119
I know whom I have believed.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:51.720
It was always fresh on his mind

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.959
that he trusted Christ as his savior

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.640
and we find that not only was it fresh on his mind

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.920
that he was saved by the grace of God

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.440
but he says at the end of the verse,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.399
against that day, he was mindful regularly

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:08.200
that he would see Christ face to face.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.519
This morning, I wanna preach a message

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.359
that I've simply entitled from verse number 12,

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:14.239
I know whom I have believed.

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:17.600
I hope this morning, just by one more moment of introduction,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600
I hope this morning you know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.040
as your personal savior.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.399
We sang that song when the roll was called up yonder.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.700
Notice what the songwriter said.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.079
I believe it was Mr. Black.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:29.440
He said this, I will be there.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.239
He didn't say I hope to be there, I might be there.

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.000
No, no, no, he said I will be there.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.160
Can I tell you this morning, you can know

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.920
that you know that you know that heaven is your home.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880
You don't have to hope so and doubt and struggle

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.000
with all of these thoughts.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.480
No, you can know but it's not because of anything

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.440
that you've done, it's not because of anything I've done,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.679
it's not because of anything that we deserve.

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:52.480
It's because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.200
on a cruel cross.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.239
When he bore our sin upon Calvary,

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:59.459
when he took upon him the sin of the world,

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:03.399
when he became sin for us, the one who knew no sin

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:06.000
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.200
when he was buried in that borrowed tomb,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.440
but oh, he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.839
he's alive forevermore.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.239
And when you place your trust in the finished work

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:18.640
of Christ at Calvary, not anything that you could do,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.100
not my good works, not some religion,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.720
but in the Lord Jesus Christ, you can have that assurance

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.559
that heaven is your home.

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.839
You go through life saying I know whom I have believed.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.660
And I know that one day I'm gonna see him face to face,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.179
oh, it's wonderful.

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.700
It's wonderful to be a Christian.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.179
It's wonderful to know the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:07:38.179 --> 00:07:40.299
Notice with me as we get into the text this morning,

00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:42.179
number one, if you're taking notes in verses three

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:45.940
through six, we see Paul's concern for Timothy.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.019
Paul's concern for Timothy.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:50.140
It's given to us in these few verses

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.899
as we start looking at our text this morning,

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.859
we could use the word compassion as well as concern.

00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:57.420
But notice in verse three, it says I thank God

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.420
whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.140
that without ceasing, I have remembrance of thee

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.019
in my prayers night and day, greatly desiring to see thee,

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:13.619
being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.820
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.940
that is in thee.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.940
Notice in verse five, which dwelt first

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.420
in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.679
and I am persuaded that in thee also.

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:30.220
Wherefore, I put thee in remembrance

00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:33.979
that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.619
by the putting on of my hands.

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:37.900
As we look at these few verses,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.539
we see Paul's concern for Timothy.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.059
Paul has a measure of concern.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.900
He has compassion on his son in the faith, Timothy.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.419
We've mentioned already that in verse number two,

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:48.460
we looked at it last week.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.700
He says to Timothy, my dearly beloved son.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.020
And the apostle Paul has concern for Timothy.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.539
We've mentioned as we've studied through the first letter,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:02.739
first Timothy, that Timothy was facing some difficulty.

00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:03.979
He was facing some trials.

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:06.059
He was facing some opposition.

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:08.260
There's some false teachers there in Ephesus.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.979
And it seems as if, as you read these two letters,

00:09:11.979 --> 00:09:16.460
that Paul is writing to Timothy that there's such an emphasis

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.020
on the idea of continuing and finishing

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.179
because there was some measure of pressure

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:25.020
that Timothy was facing.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.219
And can I tell you this morning that when we face pressure,

00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:32.260
there's always the thought that I'm just gonna give up.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.460
I'm just gonna quit.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.940
The pressures are too much.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.539
The pressures are overwhelming.

00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:40.059
And there's a way out of these pressures.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:41.979
It's just gonna be that I stop.

00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:47.340
And so Paul is encouraging his son in the faith, Timothy,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.380
to continue.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.340
And he has concern for him.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.580
And this concern is evidence to me

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.059
as I look at these few verses of Scripture

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:56.500
as we begin this morning.

00:09:56.539 --> 00:09:58.739
How is it that we see the concern

00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:00.299
that Paul has for Timothy?

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:04.139
Well, number one, it's revealed to us by his prayer life.

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.639
In verse number three, notice what Paul says,

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:10.239
that without ceasing, the end of the verse,

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:17.579
I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:18.859
Paul is praying for Timothy.

00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:21.579
Why? Because he's concerned for Timothy.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.659
Paul is praying, listen, you pray for the things that concern you.

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:26.859
You pray for the people that you're concerned about,

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.099
the people that you care about,

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:30.639
the people that you pray for, those people.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.539
And Timothy is there in Ephesus,

00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:36.079
and Paul is in prison awaiting a martyr's death.

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:38.919
And we find that Paul is writing this letter,

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:41.679
and he's saying to Timothy, I'm praying for you.

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:45.379
I'm ceasing not to pray day and night.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:47.919
And we think about the way that that would, yes,

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:52.999
encourage Timothy, but you also note the concern of Paul

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:56.999
and understand that it's revealed to us through his prayers.

00:10:57.099 --> 00:10:59.659
We find that it's revealed to us not only through the fact

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.239
that he's praying for Timothy, but in verse number four,

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:05.699
it's revealed to us because he desires to see him.

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:11.079
Notice in verse number four, greatly desiring to see thee.

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:13.279
You think about the idea,

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:17.819
Paul was a man that served the Lord with much adversity.

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:20.659
Paul was a man that faced great opposition.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:25.519
And we find that Paul had experienced the comfort of God,

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:29.119
the encouragement from God, many times, yes,

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:31.719
directly from God, but you know that there were times

00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:34.999
that God used people to encourage

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:38.199
and comfort the apostle Paul by their coming.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:40.459
If you read 2 Corinthians, you find that he says

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.639
that they're overwhelmed, they got all these things going on

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:46.099
but they were comforted by the coming of Titus.

00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:48.979
And Titus came, God sent Titus,

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:52.379
and God encouraged Paul through Titus coming.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.339
In fact, next week, as we study the end of chapter number one

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:57.039
here of 2 Timothy, you read about a man

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:58.299
by the name of Anesiphorus.

00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:01.079
The Bible says he oft refreshed me.

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:05.519
And we find here that Paul, he has this desire to go

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.239
and to see Timothy, to be with him, why?

00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:10.219
Because he was concerned for him.

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:11.919
You ever have somebody that you're concerned for

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:14.519
and you say, man, I just wish I could go visit with them.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.219
I wish I could go be with them.

00:12:16.219 --> 00:12:18.119
Now, there are times in which maybe

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:19.699
the travel is not possible.

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:22.559
There's some number of miles that would separate us

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:24.739
from the person that we're concerned with

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:26.299
and where we are.

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:29.239
But we find that with technology today,

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:30.499
we can pick up a phone.

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:32.079
If you have a real smartphone,

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.739
you can do a video conference and all that type of thing.

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.279
And you can receive comfort,

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.639
but you can also comfort someone.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.219
And we find that Paul, he says,

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:45.979
I noticed when he says greatly desiring to see thee, why?

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:48.219
Because I'm concerned about you.

00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:50.299
I think about Paul and the role that he has

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:54.099
as being the mentor and influencing and investing

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:56.919
and making this deposit into the life of Timothy.

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:58.619
He wants to encourage Timothy,

00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:01.659
but in so doing, he reveals to us this morning

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:04.539
that he has this great deal of concern

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:06.199
for his son in the faith.

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:08.039
He's concerned for him.

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:09.739
It's revealed to us by his prayers

00:13:09.739 --> 00:13:10.979
as recorded in verse number three,

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:13.339
by his desire in verse number four to see him.

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:16.079
He says this, being mindful of thy tears,

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.479
that I may be filled with joy.

00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:20.919
I want you to think about that.

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:25.319
He says, being mindful of thy tears.

00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:27.819
We don't know, and Bible scholars disagree,

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:30.779
and they dispute it, whether Paul is referencing

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:33.479
the tears that were shed at the departure

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.459
from when Paul and Timothy last saw one another,

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:39.299
or if Paul's referring to the tears

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:41.399
that Timothy's shedding because of all

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.659
that he's dealing with.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.059
You be the judge, maybe it's both.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.899
And in fact, we find that,

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:52.419
as Timothy would be ministering there in Ephesus

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.559
and dealing with all the turmoil

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:56.659
and all the opposition and the false teaching

00:13:56.659 --> 00:13:57.939
and all that's going on,

00:13:57.939 --> 00:14:02.499
no doubt there were some times that he shed some tears.

00:14:02.499 --> 00:14:03.939
Can I remind you what Paul says

00:14:03.939 --> 00:14:06.539
to those same leaders of the church at Ephesus

00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:07.939
in Acts chapter number 20?

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:12.719
He says that he was ministering day and night with tears.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.819
With tears.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:19.359
And so we find that, as Paul would shed some tears

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:21.479
because of the people he was trying to reach

00:14:21.479 --> 00:14:23.919
and minister to and because of all that was going on,

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:28.099
no doubt Timothy as well was probably shedding some tears.

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:32.199
And Paul says that he was greatly desiring

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.559
to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:35.940
but then notice the end of verse number four,

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.440
that I may be filled with joy.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.339
And I begin to think about that statement

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:43.179
and how it would bring joy to Paul

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:45.440
to be able to be in the presence of Timothy,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.919
to encourage him to see Timothy built up

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:50.879
and edified.

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:52.779
Listen, if God would use you to encourage somebody

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:55.779
because you're concerned about their spiritual being,

00:14:55.779 --> 00:14:58.679
their spiritual growth, their faithfulness to God,

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:02.259
and you have the opportunity that God would use you

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:03.720
to be an encouragement to them,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.559
man, that brings you joy.

00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:07.299
Brings you joy.

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:09.259
And Paul says, I'm concerned.

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:10.759
I'm concerned.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:13.500
It's revealed to us here in these few verses of scripture

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.299
through his prayers, through his desire.

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:16.979
Notice in verse number five and six,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I believe that Paul reveals to us his concern for Timothy

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:25.279
by what he says, by his words of remembrance.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.339
It says in verse number five, when I call to remembrance,

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:32.299
now understand that as Paul is very familiar with Timothy

00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:33.419
and with Timothy's family,

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:35.819
that he begins to recollect some things.

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:37.139
He begins to remember some things

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:41.139
and he's going to reveal to Timothy these things

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:44.879
to yes, encourage him, but also to reveal to us his concern.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.399
He says, when I call to remembrance,

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:50.440
the unfeigned faith, that word is interesting.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.799
It means not to be counterfeit.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:55.440
It means not hypocritical.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.879
Really, as we think about this faith, it is a sincere faith.

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:01.119
It is real faith.

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:04.759
He says, unfeigned faith, notice,

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:08.919
which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:11.179
and thy mother Eunice.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:15.399
But then notice this, and I am persuaded that in thee also.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:17.500
Timothy was a man of faith.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.879
Timothy was a man that believed God.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:21.720
But you know, there are some people,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.319
we often use the terminology

00:16:23.319 --> 00:16:25.579
of speaking about heroes of the faith.

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:28.239
There's some times that people's faith can be shaken.

00:16:29.299 --> 00:16:33.319
You deal with adversity and opposition and it builds up

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.919
and it builds up and the turmoil and the trials

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:38.079
and all that comes, and if we're not careful,

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:41.000
that faith can be shaken.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But Paul says, listen, I'm calling to remembrance.

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.679
There was some generational faith,

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.159
your grandmother, your mother,

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:50.519
but I'm persuaded that in thee also.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:53.879
And Paul had this concern that Timothy would continue

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.440
and therefore, he says in verse number six,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.199
wherefore, I put thee in remembrance,

00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:01.440
notice what he says, that thou stir up the gift of God,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.259
which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.299
Now, we believe as you look here,

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:09.399
you look back in 1 Timothy chapter five

00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:11.720
and there was mention of this as well

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.119
there in that text of scripture where it says,

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:18.519
lay hands suddenly on no man in chapter five in verse 22.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:20.759
And we find that it was very common

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:23.000
and in fact, it's still practiced today

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.759
where you use that phraseology of laying hands on someone.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:29.359
There's no transference of gift that comes through that,

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.639
but there's an acknowledgement

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:33.059
that God has called an individual.

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:36.559
You do that sometimes when you have an ordination service,

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:38.479
someone's gone through the ordination council,

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:40.679
they're being ordained to the ministry

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:43.239
and you'll pray over them or pray with them

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.720
and you'll lay hands on them.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.479
And I remember when I was ordained,

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:49.279
I remember the deacons in our church

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:51.679
when I was in Pennsylvania before I came here to pastor,

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.399
the deacons in our church and our pastor,

00:17:53.399 --> 00:17:55.039
they all got around me when I was on the altar

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:57.959
and they laid hands on me and they prayed.

00:17:57.959 --> 00:17:59.000
And so what is Paul doing?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.459
He's remembering, he's concerned for his son in the faith

00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:06.539
and it's revealed to us by these opening statements

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:08.279
of what he's saying to Timothy.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.119
And I just wonder this morning,

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:13.399
do we have any concern for our brothers and sisters

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:15.039
in Christ?

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:17.679
I wonder this morning if that concern

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.119
is revealed through compassion.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:21.239
I wonder this morning if there's some people

00:18:21.239 --> 00:18:22.559
that were concerned about them.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.759
I mean, they're dealing with some struggles,

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:28.000
they're overwhelmed and they're dealing with some adversity

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.039
and some opposition and I wonder, are we praying for them?

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:36.880
I'm wondering, do we have that desire to go see them,

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:40.239
to be in their presence as Paul says in verse number four,

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:41.880
greatly desiring to see thee.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.119
Listen, my desire and your desire for our brothers

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.880
and sisters in Christ ought to be that we walk worthy,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.080
that we please God, that you see somebody that's missing,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.440
somebody that's not here,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.979
somebody that you haven't seen in a while.

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.839
Hey, you pray for them, you pick up a phone

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:58.519
and you call them, you go and you visit them

00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.919
and you find out, hey, how are you doing?

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.359
Why?

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.559
Because we're concerned.

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:06.959
You know we live in a wicked world.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:12.739
You know that this right here is a safe place,

00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:17.359
the church house, it's a place where you can come

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.239
and we can be encouraged and we can,

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:21.519
man, somebody might ask you in this place,

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:23.959
how's your Bible reading and what's the Lord doing

00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:26.500
in your life and how's God answering your prayers

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.760
and you can be encouraged, but you know what?

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.159
You leave this place and you're out in the world

00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:33.959
and it's a dirty world, it's a wicked world.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.799
It's a world that's against God.

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.599
Do I have to belabor that point

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:42.839
or do we just all acknowledge it?

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:44.479
It's a world that's against God.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.479
Not only against God, but against God's people.

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:52.479
The world hates Christians,

00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:55.599
but the world hates Christians because they hate Christ.

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:57.159
You have to understand that.

00:19:57.159 --> 00:20:00.279
Jesus said, if they hate you,

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:06.119
remember, they hated me. Right? That's what he told us. And so we find here this morning

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:10.739
that we have an enemy. You're not the only one that has an enemy. Every one of your brothers

00:20:10.739 --> 00:20:15.219
and sisters in Christ have an enemy. And guess what the enemy is doing in your life but also

00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:23.059
what the enemy is doing in their life is seeking whom he may devour. Is that not true? And

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:28.019
we ought to have concern one for another. We ought to understand this thing that we

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:33.619
see here as Paul is saying, listen, I have this concern. Why? Because I don't want you

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:38.899
to be devoured by the enemy. I don't want you to quit. I don't want you to give up.

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:43.419
I want you to continue. I want you to please God with your life. I want you, notice what

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:46.939
Paul says, hold your place here, but turn back to the book of Colossians, if you will.

00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:51.039
And I want you to see what Paul says in Colossians chapter number one. And this is so important

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:56.899
as we understand Paul's mindset in ministry with regard to those that God would allow

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:03.339
him to minister to. And Paul says this, remember, Paul never was in Colossae. He didn't start

00:21:03.339 --> 00:21:08.859
the church in Colossae. He didn't know these believers in Colossae. He simply heard about

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:14.179
them because Epaphras brought word and he heard about them and he was rejoicing. You

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:18.939
read the beginning of chapter number one. I mean, he's rejoicing and he's thanking God

00:21:18.939 --> 00:21:25.059
for these believers in Colossae and he's praying that they would be spiritually mature and

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:29.059
they would grow and they would be used of God. It's amazing, we don't have time to look

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:33.779
at the details of the prayer in verses nine through 14, but it is powerful. But at the

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:38.859
end of the text of scripture, notice in verse 28, what Paul says, whom we preach warning

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:45.859
every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:53.099
Jesus. Why does Paul have that as his motive, as his concern? Well, because he knows that

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:59.179
every child of God, every believer is going to stand before Christ at the Bena seat, at

00:21:59.179 --> 00:22:04.179
the judgment seat of Christ, and his desire, not only for himself, but for those that he

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:09.379
ministered to, those that he had an opportunity to influence, was that they may be able to

00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:15.739
stand perfect in Christ Jesus. Now understand, that's dealing with being complete. That's

00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:22.739
having the idea of being, walking in a worthy manner. And that's Paul's desire. And he's

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:30.259
concerned. And Paul had a concern for Timothy. I'm sure that this morning, all of us know

00:22:31.499 --> 00:22:38.499
someone who stopped serving God. All of us know someone, who for whatever reason, stopped

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:49.259
serving God. They just quit, they gave up, the pressures were too much, the enemy brought

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:54.859
some temptations and they fell in sin. Whatever the circumstances, but they're not serving

00:22:54.859 --> 00:23:01.859
God today. I wonder this morning, how does that affect you? It ought to break our hearts.

00:23:02.499 --> 00:23:06.419
Break our hearts. We ought to be concerned one for another. But our concern for one another

00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:13.419
should be well before they fall out. Amen? We see it here, Paul's concern. Number two,

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:20.379
not only do we see Paul's concern for Timothy, but we see this in verses 7-12, Paul's confidence

00:23:20.379 --> 00:23:25.619
in the Lord. And I love this portion of scripture because we see that Paul, as much as he's

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:29.699
concerned for Timothy, he's got this great confidence in the Lord. Listen, you can be

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:33.139
concerned for your brothers and sisters in Christ, and you should be, but you've got

00:23:33.139 --> 00:23:36.739
to point them to Christ. And you've got to understand that Christ is the one that can

00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:42.219
do a work. Christ is the one that can make the difference in the life of that individual

00:23:42.219 --> 00:23:46.259
and that brother or sister in Christ. He's the one that's made the difference in our

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:51.019
lives. We've got to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. We find

00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:57.779
in verse 7, for God hath not given us the spirit of fear, no, but of power and of love

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:03.539
and of a sound mind. And so Paul begins to reveal here the provision of God in verse

00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:10.259
number 7. What has God given to his children so that in the midst of this wicked and perverse

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:15.779
generation, in the midst of these last days when perilous times shall come, when evil

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:19.779
men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, we read that in the third chapter of this

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:26.099
letter, how is it that we can continue? How is it that we can not give up and not give

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:32.459
in? Well, we understand the provision of God. He has given us, we find, he's not given to

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:40.619
us the spirit of fear. Listen, we're not to fear what man can do unto us. Amen? Hebrews

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:48.099
13, the Lord, the Bible says that he said he would never leave us nor forsake us so

00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:55.099
that we might say, I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Listen, greater is he that

00:24:55.099 --> 00:25:01.379
is in you than he that is in the world. Hallelujah. That we understand the provision of God. He's

00:25:01.379 --> 00:25:05.459
not given us the spirit of fear. Listen, it ought not be that God's people are running

00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:12.579
around being afraid. God's given us his word. You understand this morning he's on his throne.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:17.059
You say, Pastor, you see the news. I saw all kinds of things in the news this week. But

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:22.059
you know what you didn't see in the news but we know to be true is that God's on his throne.

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:28.739
There is no headline that you read this week that said God was on the throne. Am I right?

00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:32.739
Can I tell you this morning, God's on his throne. He's on his throne. He rules and he

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:38.219
reigns. And we find he's not given us the spirit of fear but notice as it says in verse

00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:47.339
number three, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. We find that as we saturate

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:52.739
our minds with God's word, as we get into the book, listen, here's what I find as I,

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:56.299
all these things that are coming down the pike, all the news headlines, you know what's

00:25:56.299 --> 00:25:59.259
going on? People like to say that the world's falling apart. Things are just falling in

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:07.779
place. The hour's near. The hour's near. Hallelujah. But there's a lot of work to be done. Listen,

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:12.059
don't be overwhelmed with fear. The devil wants you to be afraid. The enemy wants you

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:17.699
to be afraid. But God, his provision is that he's not given to us the spirit of fear but

00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:25.459
he's given to us love and power and a sound mind. Hallelujah. I think about Samuel. As

00:26:25.899 --> 00:26:30.259
Samuel was there and he was hearing the call of God and he wasn't familiar with the voice

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:34.859
of God. He had no idea. And he runs in to see Eli because he thinks that's, who's calling

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:38.939
him? He thinks Eli's calling him. And it happens multiple times and Eli finally recognized

00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:43.139
what's going on and he says, listen, when you hear your name called again, say, speak

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:50.379
Lord for thy servant heareth. You know, Samuel goes and lays down and God calls again and

00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:54.619
Samuel responds that way. And it's interesting in the text of scripture what God says he's

00:26:54.619 --> 00:27:00.259
going to show him things that are going to come. Things are going to come. You know God's

00:27:00.259 --> 00:27:03.779
given us a Bible and he's revealed to us things that are going to come. We don't have to have

00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:08.459
a spirit of fear. Listen, if we didn't have a Bible I could understand being afraid. Honestly.

00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:12.739
If I didn't know the Lord, if I didn't know the Lord and I didn't have his word, I could

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:16.699
be afraid with all these things going on in our society. But oh, God's not giving us the

00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:21.259
spirit of fear. We see that Paul is confident in the Lord because of God's provision. I

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:25.699
find in verse number eight that Paul is confident in the Lord because of God's power. Notice

00:27:25.699 --> 00:27:30.259
in verse eight, be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:39.499
prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.

00:27:39.499 --> 00:27:43.499
Listen this morning, you understand that God has all power. He doesn't just have most power.

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:49.959
He has all power. The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. All power is given unto me in heaven

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:57.919
and in earth. I am the Lord God almighty. That's what God said to Abraham. We find this

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:02.119
morning that we need to have confidence in the Lord. Why? Well, because his provision,

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:06.959
but also because of his power. Listen, when I know the God of the universe that is my

00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:13.599
God, my savior, that he has all power, man, I can have confidence in him. I ought to live

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:18.199
in confidence. We find that he mentions in the next verse, verse number nine, the purpose

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:23.559
of God who has saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:28.039
but according, notice what it says, to his own purpose and grace, which was given us

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:35.679
in Christ Jesus before the world began. I'm thankful that God has a purpose. Aren't you

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:40.519
glad that God has a purpose? Every time God moves, do you understand that God moves with

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:44.719
purpose? You ever do something or maybe somebody else does something, you say, what was the

00:28:44.719 --> 00:28:50.599
purpose of doing that? Why did you do that? Something happened the other day and there

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:58.599
were some kids being kids in the hotel lobby and they were being rambunctious and whatever

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:01.759
and something happened and I said, well, what happened over there? What was the purpose

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:06.079
of that? One guy said, they're just being stupid. I was like, well, okay, I get it,

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:13.679
but what was the purpose? Why were you doing that? The reality is that our God always moves

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:19.719
with purpose. He always moves with purpose. You might not today understand the purpose

00:29:19.719 --> 00:29:27.679
of what God's doing, but can I tell you that you must rest in knowing that God has a purpose.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:32.599
You say, but what about this thing? What about that thing? What's going on? God has a purpose.

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:37.359
Do you know that God's world and God's view is a whole lot bigger than any of us? I understand

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:41.679
this morning that God is at work, that God is doing things and he's moving and God has

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:47.159
a view that is far better and far higher than what any of us can see. And there are

00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:52.119
times that God will move over here because he's going to try to accomplish something

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:58.419
over here. And God has a purpose in all of it. And we may not, from our vantage point,

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:00.319
we may not understand it, but we

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:05.479
We must rest in the fact that the omnipotent, omniscient God has a purpose.

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:07.359
He has a purpose in your life.

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.719
He has a purpose in my life.

00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:12.999
And we find that he moves with purpose.

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.919
He says, according to his own purpose.

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:21.399
In verses 10 through 12, we see the confidence that Paul has in the Lord because of the plan

00:30:21.399 --> 00:30:22.399
of God.

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:25.719
And these two things, the purpose and plan, are obviously closely associated.

00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:32.439
Notice in verse 10, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior, Jesus Christ.

00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:39.159
Notice what he did, who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:40.159
through the gospel.

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:43.659
Aren't you thankful for the plan of God with regard to redemption?

00:30:43.659 --> 00:30:48.519
What he did, listen, in the ages past, the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the lamb that

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:52.079
was slain before the foundation of the world.

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:56.999
God who knows all things, he knew that he would create man in a perfect environment.

00:30:56.999 --> 00:31:01.559
He knew that he'd create them sinless and perfect, but he knew they would fall and he

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.959
knew that they would need redemption.

00:31:02.959 --> 00:31:04.599
They would need a savior.

00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:09.039
And Jesus Christ, the lamb of God that was slain, according to what Peter says before

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:14.539
the foundation of the world, listen, Ephesians deals with it as Paul would minister to those

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.079
believers in Ephesus.

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:21.959
In Ephesians chapter one, it talks about the plan of God with regard to salvation.

00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:23.239
The plan of redemption.

00:31:23.239 --> 00:31:27.559
We understand that Ephesians one, it's not talking about the who of salvation, but the

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.279
how of salvation.

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:33.839
And what God determined before the foundation of the world is not so much who was going

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:39.199
to be saved, even though he knew who was going to be saved, he didn't predetermine that.

00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:42.879
What he predetermined was how man would be saved.

00:31:42.879 --> 00:31:46.079
You know something that's amazing today, that if we were to take the time and we were to

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:50.279
go through each individual that's here, if you are saved by the grace of God, if you're

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:53.199
heaven bound, you know for sure that heaven is your home.

00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:57.479
You've been born again, that if we took the time and we start here with Tim and every

00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:01.279
single person that's saved by the grace of God gives a testimony and it ends over here

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:06.759
with Joseph, do you know that every one of us have the same way that we got saved?

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:12.839
Because there's only one way to be saved, through Jesus Christ, amen.

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:15.839
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:19.919
No man cometh unto the father but by me, neither is there salvation in any other.

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:26.399
There's only one name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:31.839
The circumstances of your salvation testimony are going to vary from person to person, but

00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:39.239
the reality is that every single one of us, the how is the same, through Jesus Christ.

00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:45.739
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, amen.

00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:49.039
God has no grandchildren, He only has children.

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:52.919
You talk to somebody, I don't know why my mommy, my daddy, they're saved, they're Christians,

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:54.739
that's not how it works.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:33:00.639
You don't, it doesn't pass through your parents' bloodline, amen.

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:07.159
Sin passes through the blood, but you've got to come to Christ personally.

00:33:07.159 --> 00:33:11.879
And He says, look at what Christ did, who hath abolished death, aren't you thankful

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:15.799
that He conquered sin, death, and the grave?

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:18.199
He's alive forevermore, hallelujah.

00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:23.199
Verse 11, we talk about the plan of God, we're unto, I am appointed a preacher.

00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:29.599
So now Paul's talking about his own ministry and God's will for his own life, I'm appointed

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:33.159
a preacher and apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.

00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:39.519
And we find that Paul mentioned that in verse number one in his introduction, and he's reminding

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:45.959
himself but also Timothy, and he's demonstrating to us his confidence that he has in God, that

00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:50.279
God has a plan for his life, God has a plan for your life.

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:54.239
For the witch calls, verse number 12, I also suffer these things.

00:33:54.239 --> 00:33:58.039
Can I tell you that the sufferings that come are ordained by God as well?

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:00.399
He's allowed them, he's allowed them.

00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:04.879
The psalmist said this, he said, I'm glad I rejoiced that I was afflicted.

00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:06.279
Why?

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:09.439
Because then I learned thy statutes.

00:34:09.439 --> 00:34:13.859
Paul understood that these, listen, he says in just a couple of chapters, yea, all those

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:17.219
that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:21.259
He says to the believers in Thessalonica, in 1st Thessalonians, he's writing to them

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:26.259
and he says, listen, you're suffering, but remember I told you you'd suffer.

00:34:26.259 --> 00:34:30.179
And so we find that he talks about these sufferings, he says, for the witch calls I also suffer

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:36.399
these things, because he was serving God, because he was faithfully doing what God called

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.139
him to do, he was suffering.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:42.779
He was not suffering as an evildoer, Peter deals with that.

00:34:42.779 --> 00:34:46.659
Listen, if you're suffering as an evildoer, that's on you.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:53.059
But if you're suffering for the cause of Christ, then happy are ye, blessed, blessed are ye.

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:57.419
Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, is that not what Peter says in 1 Peter

00:34:57.419 --> 00:34:58.979
chapter 4?

00:34:58.979 --> 00:35:03.899
And we find that we understand that Paul, he's saying, listen, nevertheless, even though

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:07.979
I'm dealing with these things, I'm in prison, I'm going to face a martyr's death, all of

00:35:07.979 --> 00:35:11.419
these things, these sufferings, listen, I am not ashamed.

00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:12.539
I'm not ashamed.

00:35:12.539 --> 00:35:18.939
Listen, I hope this morning that we'll never be ashamed of Jesus.

00:35:18.939 --> 00:35:22.059
Paul said in Romans 1 and verse 16, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is

00:35:22.059 --> 00:35:26.619
the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first and also

00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:27.619
to the Greek.

00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:33.499
But here he says, listen, I'm suffering these things, but I'm not ashamed, for I know whom

00:35:33.499 --> 00:35:36.659
I have believed and am persuaded.

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:41.099
Listen, you couldn't talk Paul out of it, you couldn't change his mind.

00:35:41.779 --> 00:35:47.619
You couldn't torture him to the place of denying his Lord, he's not ashamed.

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:56.139
I know whom I have believed, I have confidence, I have confidence, I am persuaded that he

00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:57.139
is able.

00:35:57.139 --> 00:36:02.619
Listen, I'm weak, you're weak, but our God is not.

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:08.619
He is able, notice what he says, to keep that which I have committed unto him against that

00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:10.979
day.

00:36:10.979 --> 00:36:13.659
I don't know.

00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:15.779
People talk about it all the time.

00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:17.859
Are we going to suffer persecution in America?

00:36:17.859 --> 00:36:20.499
I can't answer the question.

00:36:20.499 --> 00:36:21.579
I would say, why not?

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:22.699
That's my answer.

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:23.899
Why not?

00:36:23.899 --> 00:36:31.019
What makes us as a nation anything more special than any other people?

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:34.899
You know, there are great people all across the globe that are saved by the grace of God

00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:42.499
that are suffering great persecution all over the world.

00:36:42.499 --> 00:36:51.139
We have been spared for our life to not suffer persecution here in America.

00:36:51.139 --> 00:36:55.579
But I can tell you this morning that if the persecution comes, we ought to be able to

00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:57.959
stand and say, I'm not ashamed.

00:36:57.959 --> 00:36:59.299
I know whom I have believed.

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:01.899
I'm going to see them face-to-face one day.

00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:07.579
And I don't know all that might befall us, but I know one thing is true, that our God

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:08.579
is able.

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:12.579
And that we're not going to, listen, we're not going to turn our back on him.

00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:16.539
We're not going to, the pressure's mount, listen, it's been easy in America to be a

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:17.539
Christian.

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.139
It has been.

00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:20.139
Am I not right?

00:37:20.139 --> 00:37:24.219
It's been easy in America to be a Christian.

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:27.019
No one disowns you in America when you trust in Christ.

00:37:27.019 --> 00:37:29.179
I'm not going to, oh, somebody closed the door on me.

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:30.179
Somebody cussed me out.

00:37:30.179 --> 00:37:39.059
That is nothing compared to what people face in other parts of the world, nothing.

00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:42.259
There are people that give up and quit because of some minor pressures.

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:48.259
Oh, no, there's got to be something in us that says, I have confidence in my God.

00:37:48.259 --> 00:37:50.459
I have confidence in his provision.

00:37:50.459 --> 00:37:56.019
I have confidence in his power, in his purpose, and in his plan.

00:37:56.019 --> 00:38:01.619
Paul, in these verses, he reveals to us his concern for Timothy, but he reveals to us

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:03.859
his confidence in the Lord.

00:38:03.859 --> 00:38:06.819
Finally this morning, number three, Paul's charge to Timothy.

00:38:06.819 --> 00:38:12.539
In verses 13 through 15, we see that Paul issues this charge to Timothy.

00:38:12.539 --> 00:38:17.939
After it, with regard to the background, the backdrop of seeing what has been said in verses

00:38:17.939 --> 00:38:22.219
3 through 12, we find that Paul is going to issue this charge.

00:38:22.339 --> 00:38:23.859
It says this in verse 13.

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:48.779
Now, in these few verses of Scripture, this charge, I'm just going to highlight kind of

00:38:48.779 --> 00:38:50.619
a thought from each one.

00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:54.059
Number one from verse number 13, hold fast.

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:55.059
Hold fast.

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:58.419
I like the words that God uses there.

00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:00.059
Hold fast.

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.379
What is it that he's talking about?

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:06.619
Well, he says, hold fast the form of sound words.

00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:12.579
Now remember, we cannot take 2 Timothy independent of what we've studied in 1 Timothy.

00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:17.979
It's important to understand the continuation, the second letter going and still Timothy

00:39:17.979 --> 00:39:19.739
serving there in Ephesus.

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:25.059
He talks to him in the first chapter of 1 Timothy about these false teachers and he

00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:30.659
talks about them coming in, that they're teaching some other doctrine, that they're giving heed

00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:36.659
to fables and endless genealogies, that they're ministering questions and there's no edification.

00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:43.579
He's talking to them about these words that he talks about being vain jangling or useless

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:44.579
talk.

00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:51.059
And he goes through all that but he says that we're to be concerned with sound doctrine.

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:53.899
Sound doctrine.

00:39:53.899 --> 00:39:58.939
We find that he goes through in chapter number 4 quite extensively dealing with the fact

00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:00.419
of our spirit.

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:03.619
diet, what is it that we're taking, and what Timothy's

00:40:03.619 --> 00:40:06.859
responsibility is. He talks to him about the deception of the

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:09.419
false teachers and all that would take place in the latter

00:40:09.419 --> 00:40:12.499
days and the latter times. He tells him in verse 6 of 1

00:40:12.499 --> 00:40:15.659
Timothy chapter number 4, If thou put the brethren in

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:18.999
remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:22.939
of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of

00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:27.439
good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. He says this in

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:30.839
verse number 16, Take heed unto thyself and unto the

00:40:30.839 --> 00:40:35.639
doctrine, continuing them, for in doing this thou shalt both

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:41.239
save thyself and them that hear thee. And so Paul now says to

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:46.919
Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 1, Hold fast the form of

00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:53.599
sound words. Listen, I don't care the size of the church, the

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:57.999
popularity of the individual. If they bring some teaching that

00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:03.139
is contrary to what God says in His Word, we must reject it. We

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:09.879
absolutely must hold fast to sound words. Why do you believe

00:41:09.879 --> 00:41:12.939
what you believe? Because the Bible says and we give our

00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:17.419
answer. Amen? As Baptist people we've said historically, one of

00:41:17.419 --> 00:41:22.159
our distinctives is that as a Baptist we believe in the sole

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:27.259
authority of the Bible for faith and practice. The Bible is our

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:30.859
sole authority for faith and practice. What does that mean?

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:36.759
It's our only authority, sole authority for faith and for

00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:40.299
practice. We ought to be able to go to the Bible. Why do you

00:41:40.299 --> 00:41:43.199
believe that? Well, can I show you why I believe that? Let me

00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:44.799
show you these verses of Scripture. Here's why I believe

00:41:44.799 --> 00:41:48.239
that. And by the way, the best commentary in the Bible is the

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:52.399
Bible. Compare Scripture with Scripture. No Scriptures of any

00:41:52.399 --> 00:41:56.239
private interpretation, right? We're to compare Scripture with

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:59.579
Scripture. Listen, we're to be students of the book. You know,

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:03.479
Baptists at one point were called people of the book. By

00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:05.579
the way, it was meant to be derogatory, but what a

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:13.119
compliment. People of the book, hallelujah. It's God's book.

00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:17.419
Amen? Notice what Paul says. Hold fast in verse number 13 of

00:42:17.419 --> 00:42:21.439
chapter 1 of 2 Timothy, the form of sound words, notice,

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:25.979
which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in

00:42:25.979 --> 00:42:28.259
Christ Jesus. Now, I want you to understand that. You don't

00:42:28.259 --> 00:42:30.759
need to turn over, but I want to read to you from Galatians

00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:33.319
chapter number 1, because Paul says of what you've heard from

00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:36.299
me, but I want you to understand that Paul gives this truth in

00:42:36.299 --> 00:42:39.239
Galatians 1 and verse number 11, but I certify you, brethren,

00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:41.399
that the gospel which was preached of me is not after

00:42:41.399 --> 00:42:46.339
man. Oh, well, that's just what Paul said. No, no. Paul said

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:48.399
himself, it's not after man, for I neither received it of

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:53.059
man, neither was I taught it by, but by the revelation of Jesus

00:42:53.059 --> 00:42:57.179
Christ. All right? So, it's important that we understand

00:42:57.179 --> 00:42:59.539
when Paul says the things that thou hast heard of me among many

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:02.279
witnesses in chapter 2 and verse number 2, Paul's not saying

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:05.179
just follow me as, no, no, he's saying follow me as I follow

00:43:05.179 --> 00:43:08.119
Christ. I'm not giving you something that just came from

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:11.679
man. No, I was taught this. It came by the revelation of Jesus

00:43:11.699 --> 00:43:16.499
Christ. What a joy. So, Paul says in this charge number 1,

00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:20.699
hold fast. Hold fast what? Sound words. You ever been in a

00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:24.179
situation where you're holding on for dear life? You know what

00:43:24.179 --> 00:43:26.239
I'm talking about? Every time I get on a roller coaster, I'm

00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:30.179
holding on for dear life. I absolutely hate roller coasters.

00:43:30.179 --> 00:43:32.619
I absolutely hate them. I haven't been on one in years. I

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:35.219
don't plan to ever go on one again. The last couple of times

00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:37.499
I've been on the theme parks, I pay the ticket to get in, which

00:43:37.499 --> 00:43:39.859
is stupid because it's expensive, and I just eat some

00:43:39.879 --> 00:43:42.479
of the food, amen? It's wonderful. I don't go on any of

00:43:42.479 --> 00:43:44.519
the rides. If there's a water ride, I'll go on that, you know,

00:43:44.519 --> 00:43:47.959
like it's not too dangerous. But man, I got on a ride one time.

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:51.059
I was at King's Dominion, and it was the last time I was there,

00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:53.399
and I got on this ride, and I don't even remember what ride it

00:43:53.399 --> 00:43:55.559
was, but I got in that thing, and I held on to that thing. My

00:43:55.559 --> 00:43:59.439
knuckles were white. Everyone wasn't even in yet. I'm telling

00:43:59.439 --> 00:44:01.759
you, I was sitting there. I was scared to death, and this lady

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:03.839
was over here, and there was this little kid in between. This

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:06.879
little kid was probably 8, 9 years old, just tall enough to

00:44:06.879 --> 00:44:10.099
get on there, and the mom said, would you please relax? You're

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:14.339
making my son nervous. He can get another seat, man, because

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:16.539
there is no relaxing. Brother Tony, you understand. You can

00:44:16.539 --> 00:44:19.179
relate, amen? You're with me, okay? Listen, there's no

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:22.939
relaxing. I was holding on for dear life, and I scream like a

00:44:22.939 --> 00:44:26.259
girl when I'm on a roller coaster. No shame. I'm just

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:30.379
telling the truth. Am I not telling the truth? I'm telling

00:44:30.379 --> 00:44:38.019
you, man, I hate them. I think about that hold fast. Listen,

00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:40.979
we're not going to let go. We don't have a light grip on what

00:44:40.979 --> 00:44:45.199
God's in His Word. I'm holding on. I don't matter what anyone

00:44:45.199 --> 00:44:48.519
says. It doesn't matter the size of the ministry, the prominence

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:54.319
of the man. I got God's Word, amen? Number two, he says this

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:58.559
in verse number 14, keep. Keep what? Notice he says, that good

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:03.259
thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost

00:45:03.259 --> 00:45:07.059
which dwelleth in us. By the way, at the moment of salvation,

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:10.339
the Holy Spirit of God took up residence in your life. He is

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:13.859
the earnest of our inheritance. What a joy that we're sealed

00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:16.939
under the day of redemption. And we find that he says, keep

00:45:16.939 --> 00:45:20.739
that good thing which was committed unto thee. And God has

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:24.739
given to us this opportunity. And Paul is giving this charge.

00:45:24.739 --> 00:45:28.459
And he says, hold fast. He says, keep. In verse number 15, I

00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:31.519
believe that what he's saying here is continue. Where do I get

00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:34.819
that from? Well, I believe it's evidenced by the behavior of

00:45:34.819 --> 00:45:39.519
those in Asia that turned away. He says in verse 15, this thou

00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:45.439
knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me,

00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:49.079
of whom are figellus and hermogenes. And we find that

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:53.639
there is that turning away. But no, Timothy, when he gives this

00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:57.599
charge, hold fast, keep, and continue. You know that

00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:00.099
sometimes when other people turn away, we can be influenced to

00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:03.819
turn away as well. It says all those that were in Asia. It's

00:46:03.819 --> 00:46:06.699
interesting. We don't have time to develop all of it. But in

00:46:06.699 --> 00:46:10.059
Acts chapter 19, Paul is ministering there. And the Bible

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:14.139
tells us about his ministry, not only in Ephesus, we find it in

00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:17.979
verse number 1, that he came to the coast of Ephesus. But we

00:46:17.979 --> 00:46:21.099
find that he was there and he was ministering. We find that

00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:24.739
the Bible tells us in verse 10 that this continued by the

00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:29.639
space of two years, so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard

00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:32.999
the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. And understand

00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:39.039
that's Asia minor, modern-day Turkey area of the world. And he

00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:42.039
says that they heard, but now he's saying in chapter 1 of 2

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:47.959
Timothy, they've turned away. This morning, Paul reveals to us

00:46:47.959 --> 00:46:52.879
this concern that he has for Timothy. He's concerned for him.

00:46:52.899 --> 00:46:55.179
I don't want you to give up. I don't want you to become

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.459
overwhelmed. I don't want you to give in to the pressures. I want

00:46:58.459 --> 00:47:02.739
you to remember some things. And Paul is saying, my concern is

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:05.139
revealed to the fact that I'm praying for you. I wish I could

00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:08.659
come see you, but I'm in prison. I can't come see you, but I long

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:14.299
to be with you. I greatly desire to see you. I wonder this

00:47:14.299 --> 00:47:18.459
morning, there's somebody that you're concerned about, somebody

00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:23.759
that you're praying for, somebody that's struggling. You

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:25.759
know, the reality is that sometimes people don't like

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.959
sharing all of their struggles. Now, some people share too many

00:47:28.959 --> 00:47:32.439
struggles. You understand what I mean? There's like one end or

00:47:32.439 --> 00:47:34.779
the other end of the spectrum. Some people share nothing. Some

00:47:34.779 --> 00:47:37.559
people share everything. Very rarely do you find somebody kind

00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:40.839
of in the middle. But you understand that we all deal with

00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:45.799
struggles. We all deal with struggles. We need to pray one

00:47:45.799 --> 00:47:50.219
way or another. Somebody we're concerned about. Listen, I don't

00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:52.819
want them to become a casualty. I don't want them to become a

00:47:52.819 --> 00:47:57.219
casualty. I want to see them finish the race. I want to see

00:47:57.219 --> 00:48:00.499
them finish strong. I want to see them be used of God to do

00:48:00.499 --> 00:48:03.819
what God has equipped them to do. Paul says, I have confidence

00:48:03.819 --> 00:48:09.379
in God. How confident are you in the Lord? I'm not talking about

00:48:09.379 --> 00:48:13.579
just saying I'm confident. I'm talking about living like you're

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.599
confident in the Lord. It's one thing to say it, but I'm talking

00:48:16.599 --> 00:48:19.879
about living it. Not being tossed to and fro. Not worrying

00:48:19.879 --> 00:48:22.079
and fretting and being fearful and all these things. Did you

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:24.079
see this? Did you see that? What about this? What about that? No,

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:28.359
no, no. Remember, keep your eyes on Jesus. He's on His throne.

00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:33.599
God has all power. He's provided for us what we need. He has a

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:37.759
purpose and He has a plan and we have confidence in the Lord. And

00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:41.039
then I think about this charge to Timothy. Yes, I understand

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:44.399
contextually it's given specifically to Timothy, but by

00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:47.599
way of application this morning, I wonder how we would receive

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:55.279
the charge. Hold fast, keep, continue. I wonder this morning,

00:48:55.279 --> 00:48:59.979
are we determined? Because I know whom I have believed. Are

00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:02.459
we determined that we're going to, by God's grace and with

00:49:02.459 --> 00:49:04.719
God's help, we're just going to keep, we're going to hold fast,

00:49:04.719 --> 00:49:07.359
we're going to keep on, we're going to continue, we're going

00:49:07.359 --> 00:49:12.659
to serve Jesus until He calls us home. Amen? The Bible asks

00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:17.019
this question, will the Son of Man find faith? Will He find

00:49:17.019 --> 00:49:21.659
faith? John says this in 1 John that there will be some that

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:25.699
will be ashamed of Him at His appearing. But God says we're to

00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:29.579
occupy until He comes. He says we're to redeem the time because

00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:33.039
the days are evil. And I wonder this morning, listen, God never

00:49:33.039 --> 00:49:36.079
said it was going to be easy, but He said He'd be with us.

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:40.639
Hallelujah. You know life's not easy for lost people either, but

00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:46.839
they don't have Jesus. Amen? We've got the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:52.259
we've got the Holy Spirit of God that lives within us. Paul says,

00:49:52.259 --> 00:49:57.519
for I know whom I have believed. It was regularly on His heart,

00:49:57.519 --> 00:49:58.399
two things.

00:49:58.399 --> 00:50:06.519
saved and I'm going to see him face to face. And those two things absolutely influenced

00:50:06.519 --> 00:50:13.899
every day of his life and what he did and how he lived and how he served because he

00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:17.619
knew he was saved and he knew he was going to see Christ face to face. And I hope this

00:50:17.619 --> 00:50:24.559
morning that we too, every day of our lives, are mindful of those two things. You say,

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:27.919
Pastor, I'm not saved. I don't know that heaven is my home. Today is the day of salvation.

00:50:27.919 --> 00:50:31.599
You come to this old-fashioned altar, take a Bible and say, I know for sure that heaven

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:36.199
is your home. Do not leave here without knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Say, Pastor,

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:40.639
I've been saved by the grace of God. You're going to see him face to face one day. By

00:50:40.639 --> 00:50:46.439
the way, that brings great joy but it also causes us to tremble. It's amazing how that

00:50:46.599 --> 00:50:52.599
works. Great joy. I long to see him face to face but I know I'm going to stand before

00:50:52.599 --> 00:50:59.599
him. Receive reward or suffer loss, the Bible says. This morning, I know whom I have believed.

00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:08.759
Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. I

00:51:08.759 --> 00:51:15.519
thank you for this portion of scripture that challenges me, that challenges us. God, I

00:51:15.519 --> 00:51:20.119
pray that we would do business with you this morning as we have a moment of invitation.

00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:26.039
Lord, I pray that you'd have your will and way in the lives of those that are gathered.

00:51:26.039 --> 00:51:32.839
Lord, that you'd help us to respond in obedience. Help us to determine to be doers of the word

00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:36.719
and not hearers only. We'll give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do. For it's

00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:40.119
in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:44.319
I have a moment of invitation. Allow you to respond to the Lord this morning. Maybe you

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:47.919
want to come to the altar. The altar is open. Maybe you want to make your pew at the altar.

00:51:47.919 --> 00:51:51.519
You can pray right there where you are. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
