1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
to kind of begin our message this morning.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,679
And of course, you know, in just a couple of weeks,

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:05,920
we'll be celebrating the resurrection

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,000
of our Lord and Jesus, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'm so thankful.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,239
The truth of the resurrection

7
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,720
is the cornerstone of our faith, amen.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,960
And looking forward to that.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,319
I won't be preaching next week.

10
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,600
We'll have a missionary here.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,159
And so Brother Baloo will be preaching.

12
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,879
And so this morning,

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,180
we're gonna look at this subject matter,

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,600
dealing with the Apostle Peter

15
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,920
and a statement that he makes here

16
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,559
in 1 Peter 5 and verse number one.

17
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,719
I believe that many of us,

18
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,840
and we've talked about this in various settings

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,479
over the years in men's meetings

20
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,000
and other types of lessons,

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,779
Sunday school classes and what have you,

22
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,919
but Peter seems to be very relatable.

23
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,599
It seems like as you study the word of God,

24
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,279
that there are certain Bible characters

25
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,520
in which we can relate to better than others.

26
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,680
And Peter just seems to be one of those characters

27
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,439
that seems to be very relatable.

28
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,580
And I think about Peter and some of the declarations

29
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,279
that he made within the scriptures

30
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,840
that God has recorded for us.

31
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,180
And man, some of them are just awesome.

32
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,580
I mean, mountaintop type of declarations.

33
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,480
Some of them, you just scratch your head and say,

34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,059
yeah, he didn't really know what he was saying.

35
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:08,900
And that's okay.

36
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,480
Sometimes we're there as well.

37
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,959
But the reality I was reading this morning,

38
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,800
the book of John,

39
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,120
you remember in John chapter number six,

40
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,440
when the disciples,

41
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,279
many of those that follow Jesus left

42
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,760
and Jesus turns to the disciples and said,

43
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,680
are you gonna go away also?

44
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,360
And Peter says, to whom shall we go?

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,739
For thou hast the words of eternal life.

46
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:31,019
And we are sure, we are confident that thou art the Christ.

47
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,500
I mean, what a great declaration.

48
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,459
We think about Peter,

49
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,860
a man that walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

50
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,580
a man that encountered in his journey

51
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,500
as he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

52
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,019
he was an eyewitness of many miracles.

53
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,300
And he had the privilege of seeing the power

54
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

55
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,660
It was his own mother-in-law that was healed of a fever,

56
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
the Bible tells us.

57
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,919
And there he would see that firsthand.

58
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,540
It was Peter that got out of the boat

59
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,980
and walked on the water.

60
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,940
It was Peter that was at the Mount of Transfiguration.

61
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,639
You think about Peter and all of these wonderful things

62
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,699
and how God used Peter.

63
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,139
Of course, as you read the book of Acts,

64
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,300
you begin to see the preaching of Peter and his leadership

65
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,899
and how God used him.

66
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,460
And yes, we oftentimes we speak about,

67
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,940
well, you know, Peter doubted the Lord.

68
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,100
He denied the Lord.

69
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,919
I know he did.

70
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,940
I know he denied the Lord.

71
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,460
But the reality is that as you look at the life of Peter,

72
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,699
there's so many wonderful things in his life.

73
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,300
And you see a man that is relatable.

74
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,220
You see a man that here as he's writing to these believers

75
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,419
in the book of 1 Peter,

76
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,339
of course, he'll be used to pen the words

77
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,800
of 2 Peter as well.

78
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,020
But as he's writing the book of 1 Peter,

79
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,220
and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

80
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,380
he's seeking to encourage these believers

81
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,660
that are facing difficulty and facing persecution

82
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,259
under the rule of Nero.

83
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,580
These believers that are suffering for the cause of Christ.

84
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,220
And he's seeking to encourage them

85
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,539
and he's seeking to instruct them.

86
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,619
And he says something very interesting in verse number one

87
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,380
that leads us back to the gospels

88
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,660
will be our subject that we'll study this morning.

89
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,059
But notice what Peter says,

90
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:12,139
the elders which are among you, I exhort,

91
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,100
who am also an elder, he understands his position.

92
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,259
And then notice where he says,

93
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,259
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

94
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:27,059
And also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.

95
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,860
Before the glory, there was suffering.

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,020
And as you think about the subject

97
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,139
of the book of 1 Peter

98
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,619
and these believers that were suffering,

99
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:38,779
he tells them, listen,

100
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,580
if you're suffering for the cause of Christ,

101
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,100
happy are ye.

102
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,179
And you say, happy?

103
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,020
Blessed?

104
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes.

105
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,779
The perspective of Peter.

106
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,699
But I want you to think about that statement.

107
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,820
Think about all of the things that Peter witnessed

108
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,460
in his time of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ.

109
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,619
And under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

110
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:04,059
God directs Peter to say in verse number one

111
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:07,740
of 1 Peter 5, that he was a witness

112
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,820
of the sufferings of Christ.

113
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,979
A witness of the sufferings of Christ.

114
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,380
I want you to go back to the book of Matthew, if you will.

115
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,619
And we're gonna look at a number of scriptures this morning.

116
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
So get your fingers ready.

117
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,179
I am at a disadvantage with this contraption here.

118
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,820
So you bear with me this morning,

119
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,660
but we'll get to a number of passages of scripture.

120
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,100
I want you to see the record of his suffering.

121
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,579
God records for us in his word,

122
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,619
the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

123
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:39,019
It's interesting in Matthew chapter number 16,

124
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,299
one of those mountain pillar type of statements

125
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:47,179
that Peter makes, it was here in Matthew chapter number 16,

126
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:50,100
that Jesus says to the disciples in verse number 13,

127
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,220
whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

128
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,179
And of course, you're familiar with the response.

129
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,179
They respond to Jesus and say,

130
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,179
some say that thou art John the Baptist

131
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,820
and some Elias and others Jeremiah's

132
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,739
or one of the prophets.

133
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:05,820
And then Jesus says this in verse number 15,

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,619
but whom say ye that I am?

135
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,859
And here's Peter and man,

136
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:14,299
what a bold, precious declaration.

137
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:18,980
He says this, thou art the Christ,

138
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,299
the son of the living God.

139
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,619
And Jesus says to Peter,

140
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,500
he says this in verse number 17,

141
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,739
blessed art thou Simon Barjona

142
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,220
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,

143
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,059
but my father, which is in heaven.

144
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,380
And I say also unto thee that thou art Peter

145
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,339
and upon this rock, I will build my church

146
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,980
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

147
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,660
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

148
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,179
What sort of thou shalt bind on earth

149
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,179
shall be bound in heaven.

150
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,980
And what sort of thou shalt loose on earth

151
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,220
shall be loosed in heaven,

152
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,079
then charged to his disciples that they should tell no man

153
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,980
that he was Jesus the Christ.

154
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,100
But I wanna draw your attention to verse 21.

155
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,339
I want you to think about the excitement,

156
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,339
all that's taken place,

157
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,619
the promises that Jesus has given here,

158
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,660
that great declaration of Peter.

159
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,980
We often refer to the promise of verse number 18

160
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,140
when Jesus says, I will build my church

161
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,339
and what a blessing to see God working

162
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,579
and continuing to do that to this very day.

163
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,059
And he's promised to do so until the rapture

164
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,200
when the church is taken out of here.

165
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,220
But notice what Jesus says in verse 21,

166
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,600
from that time forth began Jesus

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,959
to show unto his disciples.

168
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,700
Now think about Peter and think about what he's experienced

169
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,380
and think about that statement that he makes

170
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,420
in first Peter five in verse number one,

171
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,299
that he is a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

172
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,179
Here in verse number 21, the Bible says that Jesus

173
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,019
beginning at that time and going forth,

174
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,619
he's beginning to reveal, to show to his disciples what?

175
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:47,820
How that he must go unto Jerusalem and what?

176
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,579
And suffer many things of the elders

177
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,799
and chief priests and scribes, notice,

178
00:06:55,799 --> 00:07:00,799
and be killed and be raised again the third day.

179
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,420
Was at that time in the life and ministry

180
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,459
of the Lord Jesus Christ, was at that time

181
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,579
that Peter as one of his followers,

182
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,820
as one of the disciples, begins to receive

183
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,500
this instruction from Jesus with regard

184
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,720
to how he would suffer many things.

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Yes, he would be killed, he would go to that cruel tree,

186
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,739
he would go to the cross of Calvary,

187
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,179
and he would suffer and bleed and die,

188
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,980
but he would rise in victory.

189
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
And we'll look at that in two weeks.

190
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,920
But I want you to think about these sufferings

191
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,859
and the record of his suffering.

192
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:35,660
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, in chapter 22.

193
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
And we're gonna stick here in Luke here

194
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,619
for just a little while as we complete

195
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,059
this point this morning.

196
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:44,140
But look at Luke chapter number 22, if you will,

197
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,019
at some time has passed in the life and ministry

198
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,619
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

199
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,980
And we find that it's in Luke chapter number 22

200
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,739
that God records for us the record

201
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,899
of what we'd refer to as the Lord's Supper.

202
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:59,220
And as the record is given to us here in Luke's gospel,

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,980
the Bible tells us beginning in verse number 13,

204
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,540
and they went and found as he had said unto them,

205
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,420
and they made ready the Passover, verse 14 of Luke 22.

206
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,660
And when the hour was come,

207
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,899
he sat down and the 12 apostles with him,

208
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,579
and he said unto them, notice what he says,

209
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,579
with desire, I have desired to eat this Passover with you

210
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,880
before I suffer.

211
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,920
Before I suffer.

212
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,140
The record of his suffering comes

213
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,020
as we continue to look through Luke chapter number 22,

214
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,380
and you'll see the arrest,

215
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,700
and you'll see the denial and all that takes place.

216
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,700
But I wanna draw your attention to Luke chapter 22

217
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,359
in verse number 63.

218
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:45,820
Jesus has been arrested in the garden of Gethsemane.

219
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,859
We read of that and we find that here

220
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:53,059
as we come to the near the end of Luke chapter number 22,

221
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,580
that the Bible tells us of Jesus Christ

222
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,260
being mocked and beaten.

223
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,900
He's the very son of God.

224
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,059
He is God in flesh.

225
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,380
He is the creator.

226
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,659
And we find that in verse number 63,

227
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:08,140
that the Bible tells us and the men that held Jesus

228
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,599
mocked him and smote him.

229
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,020
The suffering is now beginning.

230
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,380
We find that it was in Matthew in chapter number 16

231
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,380
that Jesus declares to them how that he was going to suffer.

232
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,700
And we find that he says to them there at the Passover

233
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,020
that he desired to have this Passover with them

234
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,520
before I suffer.

235
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,200
And now as we come to verse number 63,

236
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,719
we begin to see the suffering.

237
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,219
He's mocked.

238
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:40,039
He's smitten.

239
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,960
The Bible says in verse 64,

240
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,880
and when they had blindfolded him,

241
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,919
they struck him on the face.

242
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,640
Notice what they say.

243
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Prophesy.

244
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,960
Who is it that smote thee?

245
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
You know what's amazing is he knew exactly

246
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
who it was that smote him.

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,660
Can you see the suffering beginning?

248
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:13,000
When they take the Son of God, my Savior, your Savior, they've arrested Him.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,320
They begin to mock Him and they blindfold Him and they beat Him.

250
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,560
The Bible says that they struck Him on the face.

251
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
And they say, prophesy.

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Who is it that smote thee?

253
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,360
Look at verse 65, and many other things blasphemously spake they against Him.

254
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,800
He stands before the Sanhedrin at the end of chapter 22 and chapter 23.

255
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,940
It begins when He's standing there before Pilate and then Herod because Pilate learns

256
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,160
that he's of the region in which Herod is in control of there, of Galilee.

257
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,540
We find that Herod and Pilate are made friends that day.

258
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,520
According to verse number 12, they had been before at enmity and they're made friends

259
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,920
according to verse number 12.

260
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,680
And then Jesus is again before Pilate in verse 13 down through verse number 25.

261
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,680
And we find that as we continue in chapter number 23 that we come to verse number 26

262
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,800
as it begins to describe to us the crucifixion.

263
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
As they arrested Him and they mocked Him and they beat Him, and then He stands before the

264
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,760
Sanhedrin and before Pilate and Herod and then Pilate, and then we find that as Pilate

265
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:36,840
was ready to release Jesus, the crowd cried out and said, no, we'll take Barabbas.

266
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,520
As for this one Jesus, crucify Him.

267
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,960
And Pilate says, I find no fault in this man.

268
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,240
And they cry out the more, crucify Him, crucify Him.

269
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,640
The Bible begins to declare to us, look if you will, in verse 33, when they were come

270
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:08,640
to the place which is called Calvary, aren't you thankful for Calvary?

271
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,280
It says there they crucified Him.

272
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,400
That's a simple statement.

273
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,560
But the suffering of crucifixion is beyond what I can adequately describe to you this

274
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,920
morning.

275
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:33,680
The Romans had sought to perfect the art, quote-unquote, of crucifixion to make it as

276
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,320
miserable and as painful as they could possibly do.

277
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,440
How many times they would crucify these individuals and they would seek to draw it out for as

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,120
long as they possibly could to extend the period of suffering.

279
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
It's unbelievable.

280
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,920
We would use this word perhaps, it's inhumane.

281
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,480
It's the suffering of the cross.

282
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
It's a simple statement.

283
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,560
There they crucified Him.

284
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,560
But all that that entails, the male factors, one on the right hand, the other on the left,

285
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:29,720
verse 34, then said Jesus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.

286
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,920
They parted His raiment, they cast lots, the people stood beholding and the rulers also

287
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,320
with them derided Him saying, notice what they say, He saved others, let Him save Himself.

288
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,680
If He be the Christ, the chosen of God, the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and

289
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:55,000
offering Him vinegar and saying, if Thou be the King of the Jews, save Thyself.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,920
Aren't you thankful that He stayed on the cross?

291
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:10,840
He saved others, but He stayed on that cross to save us from sin, to pay the awful penalty,

292
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,000
to shed His precious blood.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm so thankful that He stayed on the cross.

294
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,680
We've often said over the years that it was love that held Him there.

295
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,760
He says that He could have called legions of angels.

296
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,120
It was for this purpose that Jesus came to earth.

297
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,480
He came to die.

298
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,000
And the Bible records for us the sufferings of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,480
And Peter says that He is, yes, an elder, but he says, I'm a witness of the sufferings

300
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,400
of Christ.

301
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,800
And this morning as we take just a few moments and consider the record that God has given,

302
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,080
of course, you can read in all four of the Gospels, you can read the record of the suffering

303
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,240
of the cross of Calvary.

304
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,080
I want you to continue thinking about this this morning.

305
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,120
I want you to consider the reason for His suffering.

306
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,559
Yes, the Bible records for us His suffering, but I want you to think about the reason.

307
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,559
It could be summed up in one word, me.

308
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,240
Each of us could say, He suffered.

309
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Why?

310
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
For me.

311
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,120
I suffered to pay for my sin.

312
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,480
And we find here this morning, turn to the book of 1 Peter, if you will, and I want to

313
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,760
draw your attention to various aspects of what Peter says before he comes to that fifth

314
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,080
chapter and says that he is a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

315
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,920
I want you to notice that he speaks of the sufferings of Christ prior to that statement

316
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,400
here in the book of 1 Peter, beginning in chapter number two.

317
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,120
In 1 Peter chapter number two, in verse number 20, notice what the word of God says with

318
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,320
regard to the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

319
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,040
It says, but what glory is it if when ye are, ye be buffeted for your faults, you shall

320
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,240
take it patiently.

321
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,320
But if when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable

322
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
with God.

323
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
Notice verse number 21, for He even here unto were ye called.

324
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:28,080
Notice when he says, Christ also suffered for us, Christ also suffered for us, leaving

325
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,720
us an example that ye should follow His steps, who did no sin, neither was guile found in

326
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,480
His mouth, who when He was reviled, reviled not again.

327
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,960
When He suffered, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously, who

328
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:51,040
His own self bear our sins in His own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin should

329
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,320
live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye are healed.

330
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,279
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop

331
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,740
of your souls.

332
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,120
Look in chapter number three, in verse number 18, where the Bible says this, for Christ

333
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:22,980
also hath once suffered for sins, the just Jesus for the unjust humankind.

334
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,559
The just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,

335
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,360
but quickened by the Spirit.

336
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,480
That truth of reconciliation, that truth of redemption.

337
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,040
Listen, there's no way for man to be redeemed, but through the precious blood of Jesus Christ,

338
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,840
that required suffering for you and for me and for humanity.

339
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,559
The Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor.

340
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,520
He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

341
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,880
We find the reason for the suffering.

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,640
Peter says that He once suffered for our sins, that why, the just for the unjust, that He

343
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,360
might bring us to God.

344
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,120
Aren't you thankful for that?

345
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,840
Chapter four, notice what he says in verse number one of 1 Peter chapter four, for as

346
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,840
much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the

347
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,559
same mind, for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.

348
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,640
You know, Peter understood that Jesus suffered all that He did in order to pay for the penalty

349
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
of sin.

350
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,200
There's no other payment that was accepted.

351
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,239
God in His wisdom, He had determined before the foundation of the world, Peter deals with

352
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:49,960
this truth as well, that Jesus is the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the

353
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
world.

354
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,400
And we find that God in His grace and His mercy, He had prescribed that this is the

355
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,119
only way by which man can be redeemed.

356
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,280
And Jesus was willing to go to that cross to suffer.

357
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:15,720
And Peter says, I'm a witness of the sufferings of Christ, I'm a witness of the sufferings

358
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
of Christ.

359
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,480
See, Peter had this understanding that Jesus was fulfilling that which had been prophesied.

360
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,679
In fact, at the end of chapter number two of 1 Peter, really he's referencing there

361
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,559
the truth of Isaiah 53.

362
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,600
Hold your place there in the book of, actually we're going to go back to the book of Acts,

363
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
so you don't need to hold your place there in 1 Peter, but go over to Isaiah 53, if

364
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,119
you will, a portion of Scripture that is familiar to many of us.

365
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:49,359
Isaiah 53, some have described this chapter as being the chapter of the suffering Savior.

366
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,239
And here we find in Isaiah 53, beginning in verse number four, notice the Bible says,

367
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,280
Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.

368
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,960
Yet, we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

369
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,820
Notice he was wounded for our transgressions.

370
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,040
He was bruised for our iniquities.

371
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,800
The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.

372
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,220
All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way.

373
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,100
The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."

374
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,240
What's interesting for Peter is used by God in the book of Acts as a leader in the first

375
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
century church.

376
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,520
And turn over to Acts 3, if you will.

377
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,800
You find that Peter is understanding even this prophecy that we read of in Isaiah 53,

378
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,640
and it's evidence that he's understanding the fulfillment of this prophecy through the

379
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,320
suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ as he gives an answer in Acts chapter number 3.

380
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,800
Now Acts chapter number 3, many of you will be familiar with the passage of Scripture.

381
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,680
It's that miracle that takes place when that lame man was laying there at the gate, beautiful.

382
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,440
Remember, Peter says to him, he's asking alms, and he says,

383
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,080
"'Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

384
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,920
rise up and walk.'"

385
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,660
And man, this guy, he was healed, and he's leaping, and he's going, walking, and leaping,

386
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,080
and praising God with them into the temple.

387
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,520
It's interesting in verse number 9, it says,

388
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,280
"'And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and they knew that it was he

389
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,520
which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder

390
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,960
and amazement at that which had happened unto him.'"

391
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,240
In the next passage of Scripture through the end of chapter number 3, we find that Peter's

392
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,600
going to preach a message, and we find that as he preaches that message, he's going to

393
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,120
reveal this truth to us that he understood the reason for which Christ suffered.

394
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,560
He'll stand before the religious leaders in chapter number 4 and give testimony with

395
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,240
regard to the miracle that takes place.

396
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,040
But I want you to see, as he's preaching in verse number 11, it says,

397
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,280
"'And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together

398
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,440
unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wandering, and Peter saw it.

399
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,360
He answered unto the people, "'You men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?

400
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,640
Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this

401
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
man to walk?

402
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,080
No, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified

403
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,480
his son Jesus.'"

404
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,120
Remember, I said this in 1 Peter 5.1, before the glory is the suffering.

405
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,040
He says that, "'The God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered

406
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,000
up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go.

407
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,240
But ye denied the Holy One and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto

408
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:00,400
you, and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are

409
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
witnesses.

410
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:08,440
And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know.

411
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,880
Yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence

412
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,960
of you all.

413
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,360
And now, brethren, I want that through ignorance he did it, as did also your rulers.'"

414
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,760
Notice in verse number 18, "'But those things which God before had showed by the mouth of

415
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,320
all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.'"

416
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,240
Listen, this morning, as we think about the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ, we consider

417
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,420
this morning the record that God has given us.

418
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,620
We consider this morning the reason for his suffering.

419
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:51,980
And as we understand the truth of God's Word, we understand that Peter, yes, he is a witness

420
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,900
of the sufferings of Christ, and we find that he makes that declaration.

421
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,380
We've not witnessed it firsthand, but we have the record of it.

422
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:10,660
And we understand the truth that Jesus Christ, God in flesh, he did it all for me.

423
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,340
He suffered.

424
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,380
This morning, when we speak about suffering, when we think about suffering, and there are

425
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,580
some in our midst that have suffered greatly, you've dealt with difficulty, but can I tell

426
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,500
you this morning that the greatest that we could suffer really pales in comparison to

427
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,180
what Jesus Christ suffered for our redemption.

428
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,860
He suffered it all, why?

429
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,340
Because he loved me.

430
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,740
How appropriate the song that Kimberly and Pierre played this morning, how deep the Father's

431
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
love.

432
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Oh man, I think about the love of God as it's demonstrated on that cruel cross, the suffering

433
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
for me and for you.

434
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,980
I want you to think about, as we finish up this morning, the result of this suffering.

435
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,140
Of course, we know it's redemption, but turn back to the book of Luke, if you will.

436
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,180
We kind of walked our way through, skipping along some passages here in the book of Luke,

437
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,340
and we ended up there in chapter 23, and looking at that suffering.

438
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:27,660
Notice if you will, in chapter 23, in verse number 46, verse 45 says that the sun was

439
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,260
dark and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst, and verse 46 of Luke 23, when Jesus

440
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,380
had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit, and having

441
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,820
said thus, he gave up the ghost.

442
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,100
He died.

443
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,340
He died.

444
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,380
The burial is recorded beginning in verse number 50 and down through the end of the

445
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,820
passage, and we understand that chapter 24, the beginning of this chapter, it records

446
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,180
for us the glorious truth of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, when

447
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,140
He conquered sin, death, and the grave, and hallelujah for the resurrection.

448
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,260
But I want to move down past the testimony of the resurrection, I want you to move down

449
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,740
to verse number 26, if you will.

450
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,180
Here in verse number 26, we're jumping right into the dialogue that Jesus is having with

451
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,540
these disciples on the road to Emmaus.

452
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,020
You remember that these disciples on the road to Emmaus, they're saddened, they take this

453
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,900
journey, they've left Jerusalem, and it's almost a seven-mile journey, and Jesus comes

454
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,820
and He begins to walk with them, and they're just saddened, and Jesus questions them about

455
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,780
their sadness, and they say, are you a stranger in Jerusalem?

456
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,140
You're not aware of the things that have happened?

457
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,580
And He asked them, what things?

458
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,220
In verse number 19, they begin to declare the things that have happened, and He says

459
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,340
in verse 25, then He said unto them, O fools and slow of heart, to believe all that the

460
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:05,820
prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into

461
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
His glory?

462
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,020
It says that beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the

463
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,980
Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

464
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,420
And what a lesson that must have been.

465
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Can you imagine?

466
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,420
And we find that they constrained Him to stay because He was going to keep on going after

467
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,020
they got home, and they said, no, the hour's late, come on, and He goes in and they're

468
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,660
going to eat, and He took the bread, He blessed it and break it, and the Bible says that their

469
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,700
eyes were opened, and then He vanished out of their sight.

470
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
You know what they did?

471
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,460
They walked back to Jerusalem, almost seven miles.

472
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,380
Jared, you did 16 miles yesterday, and Tim, I think, they did a 16-mile hike yesterday,

473
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,980
these guys almost did that.

474
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Go back to Jerusalem.

475
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,020
You know, they go back with a testimony.

476
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,380
He is risen indeed, and exciting.

477
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,020
Go down to verse 46, if you will, actually pick it up in verse 44, and He said unto them,

478
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:12,260
Jesus now speaking, these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you,

479
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,780
that all things must be fulfilled.

480
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,120
Remember we started as Peter gave that testimony that he's a witness of the sufferings of Christ,

481
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,560
and it was there after the declaration when Jesus said, who do men say that I am?

482
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:31,240
And some say John the Baptist, some Isaiah or Jeremiah, one of the other prophets, but

483
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,640
whom say ye that I am?

484
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,520
And after Peter had given that bold declaration, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living

485
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,520
God, it was at that time that Jesus began to reveal to them, to show unto them the things

486
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,200
that He must suffer.

487
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,960
And He says here in verse 44, these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet

488
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,600
with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses and

489
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,400
the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me.

490
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,360
Then opened He their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, and He said

491
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,760
unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, to rise from the

492
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,640
dead the third day, that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in His name among

493
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,600
all nations beginning at Jerusalem, and ye are witnesses of these things.

494
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,120
You know what I find in Peter?

495
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,000
I find a man that, remember Jesus said to him in a couple of chapters earlier how that

496
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,440
He was going to deny him.

497
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,800
And He said, listen, Peter, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat.

498
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,320
But He says this, but I have prayed for thee.

499
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,360
And then He says this, and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

500
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,880
And Peter, John records in John 21 that encounter when Peter and John are there.

501
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,320
It's interesting in the gospel account.

502
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,520
of the resurrection, how that He says,

503
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
go sell the disciples, and Peter.

504
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,940
And Peter, as he hears these words,

505
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,100
remember as we read there just a moment ago

506
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,320
in Acts 3, he said we're witnesses of these things.

507
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,280
And then in 1 Peter 5, in verse 1,

508
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,000
he says that I am a witness

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,840
of the sufferings of Christ.

510
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
And he says, Jesus says to them,

511
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,380
here, listen, it was written

512
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,180
and thus it behooved Christ, in verse 46,

513
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,140
to suffer, to rise from the dead the third day.

514
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,020
And then notice the result of this.

515
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,860
Yes, it's redemption and salvation

516
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,040
because now mankind can be saved

517
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,740
and we see that the truth is given,

518
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,420
that repentance and remission of sin

519
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,060
should be preached in His name among all nations,

520
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,100
beginning at Jerusalem,

521
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,040
and you're witnesses of these things.

522
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,580
The end here of Luke 24 reveals to us,

523
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,620
it records for us the ascension of Jesus Christ.

524
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,420
If you're trying to trace the timeline,

525
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,360
it's in connection there with Acts 1.

526
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,260
And you see that Peter,

527
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,100
he's embraced this responsibility that he has.

528
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,740
Yes, he's a witness, but he understands the result

529
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,320
that redemption has now been paid for.

530
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,460
The price of redemption, the blood of Christ,

531
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,900
all the way back in Genesis,

532
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,980
the prophecies regarding the blood that would be shed

533
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,980
and all of those sacrifices that were done day after day.

534
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,500
Remember, Hebrews 10 speaks about those that would stand,

535
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,780
those priests that would minister daily,

536
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,380
offering the same sacrifices that could never take away sin.

537
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,140
But this man, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever,

538
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,500
sat at the right hand of the throne of God.

539
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,580
And we find here that Peter is being used by God.

540
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,700
He's testifying.

541
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,380
I'm a witness of the sufferings,

542
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,620
and let me help you understand that as we testify

543
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,580
of the sufferings,

544
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,540
as he's writing to the believers in 1 Peter,

545
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,500
he did this for you.

546
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,980
He suffered for us.

547
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,020
This is what he did.

548
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,740
Notice, if you will, in 2 Corinthians 5.

549
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,420
In 2 Corinthians 5,

550
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,420
we've read in 1 Peter about the reason for his suffering.

551
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,820
We find that he suffered for our sin.

552
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,500
Here, the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 5 in verse 21,

553
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,500
for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.

554
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,540
Notice the last part of this verse,

555
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,220
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

556
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,060
That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

557
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,620
There's no other way for mankind to be declared righteous,

558
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,420
but through the imputed righteousness

559
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,980
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

560
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,620
In fact, Isaiah says this,

561
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,740
that all of our good works are as filthy rags.

562
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,100
As man goes about trying to establish

563
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,340
his own righteousness, he fails utterly.

564
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,220
The Bible says that we've all come short,

565
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
that we're all sinners,

566
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,540
and we understand that from Romans chapter number three,

567
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,460
and we find the result of the suffering

568
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,420
is that we now can be saved.

569
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,860
And those of us that are here this morning

570
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,740
that have been saved,

571
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,820
we can rejoice greatly

572
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,700
in the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

573
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,420
It should cause us to,

574
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,140
even as I read the passage of Scripture,

575
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,020
to be choked up.

576
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,700
To think about what he did for us.

577
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,060
He's God, but he did it for us.

578
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,340
I wanna close with this thought

579
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,420
from Hebrews chapter number 12.

580
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,260
Turn there if you will.

581
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,380
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

582
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,900
we'll make application and be done this morning.

583
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,820
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

584
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,740
Hebrews 12.

585
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,420
Beginning in verse number one.

586
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,380
Hebrews 12 and verse number one,

587
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,220
the Bible says,

588
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,100
we're foreseeing we also are encompassed about

589
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,100
with so great a cloud of witnesses.

590
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,779
Let us lay aside every weight

591
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:24,779
and the sin which doth so easily beset us

592
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,140
and let us run with patience

593
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,020
the race that is set before us.

594
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,140
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

595
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,460
notice this,

596
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,339
who for the joy that was set before him

597
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,500
endured the cross,

598
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,700
despising the shame

599
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,220
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

600
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,820
For consider him that endured such contradiction

601
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,740
of sinners against himself,

602
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,500
lest you be wearied and faint in your own minds.

603
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,820
I want you to think about the word suffer is not here,

604
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,820
but when you think about the truth that is being written,

605
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,500
when it talks about he endured the cross,

606
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,820
despising the shame,

607
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,500
verse three says that he endured such contradiction

608
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,860
of sinners against himself.

609
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,380
I think that it's fair that we could say that he suffered.

610
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,779
We read it all over the place

611
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,740
in all sorts of passages of scripture

612
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,100
that we've looked at even this morning.

613
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,580
And though the word is not there,

614
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
we see this suffering,

615
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,179
but I wanna draw your attention

616
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,100
where the Bible says in verse number two,

617
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,500
that looking unto Jesus,

618
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
the author and finisher of our faith,

619
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,540
but it says this,

620
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,460
for the joy that was set before him.

621
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,339
He endured the cross.

622
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,020
He endured that suffering.

623
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
Why?

624
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,660
For the joy that was set before him.

625
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,460
He understood that because of that suffering,

626
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,460
that suffering precedes glory.

627
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,300
And that if there's no death on the cross,

628
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,220
there's no resurrection.

629
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,700
If there's no death on the cross,

630
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,100
there's no atonement.

631
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,700
The substitutionary atonement

632
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,339
that God speaks of all throughout his word,

633
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,300
that the just dies for the unjust,

634
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,140
that we find ourselves in that position,

635
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,420
that he has taken our place.

636
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,260
And he suffered for me.

637
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,300
He suffered it all because he loved me.

638
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,140
And this morning,

639
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,619
when we think about the glorious truth of this message,

640
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:16,820
I wonder this morning,

641
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:20,220
how does it really impact us?

642
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,059
Two thoughts.

643
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:24,100
Number one, we should rejoice greatly.

644
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,339
I mean, we ought to just take some time

645
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:30,500
and just really thank God for our salvation.

646
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,220
I understand this morning that in a sense,

647
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,140
my salvation cost me nothing,

648
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,140
but it cost him everything.

649
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,140
Cost him everything.

650
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,179
When I think about,

651
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,220
go back and read all four gospel accounts

652
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,980
of the crucifixion.

653
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,059
I couldn't do it publicly this morning,

654
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,580
but you go back this afternoon

655
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,300
and you read all four gospel accounts

656
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,100
of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

657
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
As you read it,

658
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,059
as the tears flow down your cheeks,

659
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,980
just thank him.

660
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
Rejoice greatly.

661
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,460
Because he did it all for me.

662
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,860
Personally, you say that he did it for me.

663
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,860
What joy should flood our souls?

664
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,500
Amen?

665
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,740
Preacher friend said this.

666
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,660
He said, speaking about the importance

667
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,540
of rejoicing in our salvation, for our salvation,

668
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,500
he said, there are days that we as believers

669
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
have tough days.

670
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,540
He said, but on our worst of days,

671
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm still going to heaven.

672
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,420
I'm still going to heaven.

673
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,700
Amen?

674
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,619
Think about that.

675
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,140
The suffering.

676
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,020
We're witnesses.

677
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
But then I want you to think about

678
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,660
how it impacted Peter.

679
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,860
Peter, he says in John 21, I go a fishing.

680
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,059
He's there with the Lord Jesus Christ

681
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,540
after they caught nothing.

682
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,420
Jesus said, I have prayed for thee

683
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,820
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

684
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,380
When you read of the life of Peter in the book of Acts

685
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,420
and you read as he's testifying and ministering

686
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,700
to these believers in first and second Peter,

687
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,820
you see a man that is compelled

688
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:27,100
to tell others about Jesus Christ

689
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,300
and about his suffering for them.

690
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:35,380
You know, this morning, we are privileged

691
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,700
to know this truth.

692
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,179
Honestly, it doesn't make us better.

693
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,340
It makes us accountable.

694
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,780
When I think about that this morning,

695
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,020
listen, I'm so thankful that I'm going to heaven one day.

696
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,619
I don't know when it's gonna be.

697
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,419
But one day, for every single one of us

698
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,780
that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

699
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,340
our personal Savior, heaven is real.

700
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,500
Heaven is real.

701
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,340
But there's a whole lot of people in our world

702
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:15,220
that they don't know about the sufferings of Jesus Christ.

703
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,059
They don't know what he did on the cross of Calvary

704
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,780
or why he did what he did on the cross of Calvary.

705
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,619
I remember speaking to a man when I,

706
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:27,780
I say a man, we were just teenagers, we were kids.

707
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,900
Y'all teenagers are kids, amen.

708
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,979
You know, the older you get,

709
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:34,619
the more you refer to kids that aren't really kids,

710
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:35,460
but you call them kids.

711
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,700
There's like this 20-something-year-old.

712
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,500
I found myself yesterday saying to Brianna,

713
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,580
yeah, this kid over at the store,

714
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,179
and I was like, actually, it was probably like 24,

715
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,820
but you know, I guess now he's a kid, you know?

716
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,700
And some of you, you look at me as a kid, I get it.

717
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,380
But the reality is that I was a senior in high school.

718
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,020
I had just been saved, not long.

719
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,619
Been saved for just probably a month at the most.

720
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,539
And we're sitting at a lunch table as a senior.

721
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,779
senior in high school, and there's this kid that was sitting there.

722
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,979
My brother was a sophomore, and so we had lunch together.

723
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:11,179
Actually, I had lunch together almost every day in my senior high school, and there was

724
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:14,659
a kid that was in his class, and he was sitting there with us, and I began to talk to him

725
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,539
about the Lord Jesus Christ.

726
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:25,979
And I began to talk to him about how Jesus died for him, and he had a very skewed perspective

727
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:30,179
with regard to the death of Christ on the cross of Calvary, and that it was not a willing

728
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:37,619
sacrifice, but that it was a Roman authority that forced him.

729
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,539
And I began to share truth with him, some of what I shared this morning.

730
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,779
Listen, Jesus did it all because he loved us.

731
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:52,179
Those Romans, remember what he said to Pilate, you have no authority, no power unless I give

732
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:55,579
it to you, right?

733
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,939
He could have called legions of angels, but Peter says, I'm a witness of the sufferings

734
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:02,619
of Christ.

735
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:09,539
This morning, we weren't there physically to be eyewitnesses, but in a sense this morning,

736
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,379
if you'd allow me to say it, we are witnesses of his suffering.

737
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:14,659
Amen?

738
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:21,019
We know that he suffered, and we know why he suffered.

739
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:28,339
And I trust this morning that it would not only lead us to a place of rejoicing greatly,

740
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:37,659
thanking him, having this increased level of gratitude for our redemption, but it would

741
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:43,699
lead us to, God, would you help me to share this wonderful message with someone?

742
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:50,979
I believe that as we begin to pray that way, God would delight in answering that prayer.

743
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:57,579
I challenge you this morning, I'm challenging myself, that we would say, God, would you

744
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:07,259
give me the opportunity in these next couple of weeks to share with someone the truth of

745
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:11,139
why you suffered on the cross of Calvary?

746
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,419
Would you give me the opportunity?

747
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:19,559
As we pray specifically, I believe God will answer that prayer, begin to look for those

748
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,579
opportunities that He would present to us.

749
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:27,379
See during this time, and I understand we're in a different time in our country's history.

750
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:33,619
There was a time when Easter, man, people that never went to church would be in church.

751
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:39,699
That's becoming less and less of a situation.

752
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:45,139
But there still are some people out there that have some idea of what Easter is really

753
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:47,899
all about.

754
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:52,499
Not that they've trusted Christ, not that maybe they know all of it, but this time of

755
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:57,459
our calendar gives us an opportunity.

756
00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:01,979
And I'm praying, and I want to ask you this morning to pray specifically, maybe to come

757
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:07,179
to this altar and say, God, would you give me in these next couple of weeks, give me

758
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:17,739
a divine appointment, give me an opportunity to speak of your sufferings and why you suffered.

759
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:21,019
Thank Him for your redemption, absolutely.

760
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:28,299
Read the passages, weep and rejoice that He loved you so much that He was willing to suffer

761
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:30,459
in the manner in which He did.

762
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:35,259
But then go tell someone of this great truth.

763
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:36,259
Let's pray.

764
00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:37,539
Father, we love you.

765
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:44,179
Thank you for loving us.

766
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:52,179
My heart is overwhelmed this morning, just thinking about the statement of Peter, a witness

767
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:57,139
of the sufferings of Christ.

768
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:11,819
As we read the account leading to the cross and then the cross itself, thank you.

769
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:16,579
Thank you for being obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

770
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:25,699
Rejoice in the resurrection before the glory is the suffering.

771
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:34,059
We understand that you did it all for me, personally, each one of us can say that.

772
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:41,699
I pray this morning that you'd help us to have a level of motivation to go and share

773
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:43,499
this truth with someone.

774
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:50,859
God, would you help us, each of us, to pray specifically about that opportunity, that

775
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,619
divine appointment.

776
00:44:52,619 --> 00:45:01,139
I pray, God, that you'd move and work, open doors, lead our path, that we might share

777
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:09,979
with someone the sufferings of Jesus Christ, why He suffered the way that He did, of course,

778
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:16,739
leading to the glory of His resurrection, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

779
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,699
I pray that you would guide and direct in these moments of invitation.

780
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,099
If there's one in our midst that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, we pray that

781
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:28,099
today would be the day of their salvation.

782
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:31,859
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
