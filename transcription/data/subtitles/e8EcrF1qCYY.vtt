WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.839
to kind of begin our message this morning.

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:04.679
And of course, you know, in just a couple of weeks,

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:05.920
we'll be celebrating the resurrection

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.000
of our Lord and Jesus, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.760
And I'm so thankful.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.239
The truth of the resurrection

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.720
is the cornerstone of our faith, amen.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.960
And looking forward to that.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.319
I won't be preaching next week.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:18.600
We'll have a missionary here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.159
And so Brother Baloo will be preaching.

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.879
And so this morning,

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.180
we're gonna look at this subject matter,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.600
dealing with the Apostle Peter

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.920
and a statement that he makes here

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.559
in 1 Peter 5 and verse number one.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:31.719
I believe that many of us,

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.840
and we've talked about this in various settings

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479
over the years in men's meetings

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.000
and other types of lessons,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.779
Sunday school classes and what have you,

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.919
but Peter seems to be very relatable.

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:43.599
It seems like as you study the word of God,

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:45.279
that there are certain Bible characters

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.520
in which we can relate to better than others.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.680
And Peter just seems to be one of those characters

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.439
that seems to be very relatable.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.580
And I think about Peter and some of the declarations

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.279
that he made within the scriptures

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:58.840
that God has recorded for us.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.180
And man, some of them are just awesome.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.580
I mean, mountaintop type of declarations.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.480
Some of them, you just scratch your head and say,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.059
yeah, he didn't really know what he was saying.

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.900
And that's okay.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.480
Sometimes we're there as well.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.959
But the reality I was reading this morning,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.800
the book of John,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.120
you remember in John chapter number six,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.440
when the disciples,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.279
many of those that follow Jesus left

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.760
and Jesus turns to the disciples and said,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.680
are you gonna go away also?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.360
And Peter says, to whom shall we go?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.739
For thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:31.019
And we are sure, we are confident that thou art the Christ.

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:33.500
I mean, what a great declaration.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.459
We think about Peter,

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.860
a man that walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.580
a man that encountered in his journey

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.500
as he walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.019
he was an eyewitness of many miracles.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.300
And he had the privilege of seeing the power

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.660
It was his own mother-in-law that was healed of a fever,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.660
the Bible tells us.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.919
And there he would see that firsthand.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.540
It was Peter that got out of the boat

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.980
and walked on the water.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.940
It was Peter that was at the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.639
You think about Peter and all of these wonderful things

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.699
and how God used Peter.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.139
Of course, as you read the book of Acts,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.300
you begin to see the preaching of Peter and his leadership

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.899
and how God used him.

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.460
And yes, we oftentimes we speak about,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.940
well, you know, Peter doubted the Lord.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.100
He denied the Lord.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.919
I know he did.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.940
I know he denied the Lord.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.460
But the reality is that as you look at the life of Peter,

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.699
there's so many wonderful things in his life.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.300
And you see a man that is relatable.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.220
You see a man that here as he's writing to these believers

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.419
in the book of 1 Peter,

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.339
of course, he'll be used to pen the words

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.800
of 2 Peter as well.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.020
But as he's writing the book of 1 Peter,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.220
and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.380
he's seeking to encourage these believers

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.660
that are facing difficulty and facing persecution

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.259
under the rule of Nero.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.580
These believers that are suffering for the cause of Christ.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.220
And he's seeking to encourage them

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.539
and he's seeking to instruct them.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.619
And he says something very interesting in verse number one

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.380
that leads us back to the gospels

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.660
will be our subject that we'll study this morning.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.059
But notice what Peter says,

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.139
the elders which are among you, I exhort,

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.100
who am also an elder, he understands his position.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.259
And then notice where he says,

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:21.259
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:27.059
And also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.860
Before the glory, there was suffering.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.020
And as you think about the subject

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.139
of the book of 1 Peter

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.619
and these believers that were suffering,

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:38.779
he tells them, listen,

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.580
if you're suffering for the cause of Christ,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.100
happy are ye.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.179
And you say, happy?

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.020
Blessed?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.940
Yes.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.779
The perspective of Peter.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.699
But I want you to think about that statement.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.820
Think about all of the things that Peter witnessed

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.460
in his time of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.619
And under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:04.059
God directs Peter to say in verse number one

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.740
of 1 Peter 5, that he was a witness

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.820
of the sufferings of Christ.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.979
A witness of the sufferings of Christ.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.380
I want you to go back to the book of Matthew, if you will.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.619
And we're gonna look at a number of scriptures this morning.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.260
So get your fingers ready.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.179
I am at a disadvantage with this contraption here.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.820
So you bear with me this morning,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.660
but we'll get to a number of passages of scripture.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.100
I want you to see the record of his suffering.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.579
God records for us in his word,

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.619
the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.019
It's interesting in Matthew chapter number 16,

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:43.299
one of those mountain pillar type of statements

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:47.179
that Peter makes, it was here in Matthew chapter number 16,

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.100
that Jesus says to the disciples in verse number 13,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.220
whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.179
And of course, you're familiar with the response.

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:57.179
They respond to Jesus and say,

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.179
some say that thou art John the Baptist

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:01.820
and some Elias and others Jeremiah's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.739
or one of the prophets.

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.820
And then Jesus says this in verse number 15,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.619
but whom say ye that I am?

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:10.859
And here's Peter and man,

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:14.299
what a bold, precious declaration.

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:18.980
He says this, thou art the Christ,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.299
the son of the living God.

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:24.619
And Jesus says to Peter,

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:26.500
he says this in verse number 17,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.739
blessed art thou Simon Barjona

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:31.220
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.059
but my father, which is in heaven.

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.380
And I say also unto thee that thou art Peter

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.339
and upon this rock, I will build my church

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.980
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.660
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.179
What sort of thou shalt bind on earth

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:45.179
shall be bound in heaven.

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.980
And what sort of thou shalt loose on earth

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.220
shall be loosed in heaven,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.079
then charged to his disciples that they should tell no man

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.980
that he was Jesus the Christ.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.100
But I wanna draw your attention to verse 21.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.339
I want you to think about the excitement,

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:58.339
all that's taken place,

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.619
the promises that Jesus has given here,

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:02.660
that great declaration of Peter.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.980
We often refer to the promise of verse number 18

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.140
when Jesus says, I will build my church

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.339
and what a blessing to see God working

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.579
and continuing to do that to this very day.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.059
And he's promised to do so until the rapture

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.200
when the church is taken out of here.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.220
But notice what Jesus says in verse 21,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.600
from that time forth began Jesus

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.959
to show unto his disciples.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.700
Now think about Peter and think about what he's experienced

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.380
and think about that statement that he makes

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.420
in first Peter five in verse number one,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.299
that he is a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.179
Here in verse number 21, the Bible says that Jesus

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.019
beginning at that time and going forth,

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.619
he's beginning to reveal, to show to his disciples what?

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:47.820
How that he must go unto Jerusalem and what?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.579
And suffer many things of the elders

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.799
and chief priests and scribes, notice,

00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:00.799
and be killed and be raised again the third day.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.420
Was at that time in the life and ministry

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.459
of the Lord Jesus Christ, was at that time

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.579
that Peter as one of his followers,

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.820
as one of the disciples, begins to receive

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.500
this instruction from Jesus with regard

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.720
to how he would suffer many things.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.720
Yes, he would be killed, he would go to that cruel tree,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.739
he would go to the cross of Calvary,

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:24.179
and he would suffer and bleed and die,

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:26.980
but he would rise in victory.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.980
And we'll look at that in two weeks.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.920
But I want you to think about these sufferings

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.859
and the record of his suffering.

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:35.660
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, in chapter 22.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.660
And we're gonna stick here in Luke here

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.619
for just a little while as we complete

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.059
this point this morning.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:44.140
But look at Luke chapter number 22, if you will,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.019
at some time has passed in the life and ministry

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.619
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.980
And we find that it's in Luke chapter number 22

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.739
that God records for us the record

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.899
of what we'd refer to as the Lord's Supper.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.220
And as the record is given to us here in Luke's gospel,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.980
the Bible tells us beginning in verse number 13,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.540
and they went and found as he had said unto them,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.420
and they made ready the Passover, verse 14 of Luke 22.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.660
And when the hour was come,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.899
he sat down and the 12 apostles with him,

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.579
and he said unto them, notice what he says,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:20.579
with desire, I have desired to eat this Passover with you

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.880
before I suffer.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.920
Before I suffer.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.140
The record of his suffering comes

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.020
as we continue to look through Luke chapter number 22,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.380
and you'll see the arrest,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.700
and you'll see the denial and all that takes place.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.700
But I wanna draw your attention to Luke chapter 22

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.359
in verse number 63.

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:45.820
Jesus has been arrested in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.859
We read of that and we find that here

00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:53.059
as we come to the near the end of Luke chapter number 22,

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:55.580
that the Bible tells us of Jesus Christ

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.260
being mocked and beaten.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.900
He's the very son of God.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.059
He is God in flesh.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:02.380
He is the creator.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.659
And we find that in verse number 63,

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:08.140
that the Bible tells us and the men that held Jesus

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.599
mocked him and smote him.

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:14.020
The suffering is now beginning.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.380
We find that it was in Matthew in chapter number 16

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.380
that Jesus declares to them how that he was going to suffer.

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.700
And we find that he says to them there at the Passover

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.020
that he desired to have this Passover with them

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.520
before I suffer.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.200
And now as we come to verse number 63,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.719
we begin to see the suffering.

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:38.219
He's mocked.

00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:40.039
He's smitten.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:42.960
The Bible says in verse 64,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.880
and when they had blindfolded him,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.919
they struck him on the face.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.640
Notice what they say.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.520
Prophesy.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.960
Who is it that smote thee?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.840
You know what's amazing is he knew exactly

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.200
who it was that smote him.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.660
Can you see the suffering beginning?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:13.000
When they take the Son of God, my Savior, your Savior, they've arrested Him.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.320
They begin to mock Him and they blindfold Him and they beat Him.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.560
The Bible says that they struck Him on the face.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.000
And they say, prophesy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.400
Who is it that smote thee?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.360
Look at verse 65, and many other things blasphemously spake they against Him.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.800
He stands before the Sanhedrin at the end of chapter 22 and chapter 23.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.940
It begins when He's standing there before Pilate and then Herod because Pilate learns

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.160
that he's of the region in which Herod is in control of there, of Galilee.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.540
We find that Herod and Pilate are made friends that day.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.520
According to verse number 12, they had been before at enmity and they're made friends

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.920
according to verse number 12.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.680
And then Jesus is again before Pilate in verse 13 down through verse number 25.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.680
And we find that as we continue in chapter number 23 that we come to verse number 26

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.800
as it begins to describe to us the crucifixion.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.640
As they arrested Him and they mocked Him and they beat Him, and then He stands before the

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.760
Sanhedrin and before Pilate and Herod and then Pilate, and then we find that as Pilate

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:36.840
was ready to release Jesus, the crowd cried out and said, no, we'll take Barabbas.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.520
As for this one Jesus, crucify Him.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.960
And Pilate says, I find no fault in this man.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:52.240
And they cry out the more, crucify Him, crucify Him.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.640
The Bible begins to declare to us, look if you will, in verse 33, when they were come

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:08.640
to the place which is called Calvary, aren't you thankful for Calvary?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.280
It says there they crucified Him.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.400
That's a simple statement.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.560
But the suffering of crucifixion is beyond what I can adequately describe to you this

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.920
morning.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:33.680
The Romans had sought to perfect the art, quote-unquote, of crucifixion to make it as

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.320
miserable and as painful as they could possibly do.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.440
How many times they would crucify these individuals and they would seek to draw it out for as

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.120
long as they possibly could to extend the period of suffering.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.120
It's unbelievable.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.920
We would use this word perhaps, it's inhumane.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.480
It's the suffering of the cross.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.960
It's a simple statement.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.560
There they crucified Him.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.560
But all that that entails, the male factors, one on the right hand, the other on the left,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:29.720
verse 34, then said Jesus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.920
They parted His raiment, they cast lots, the people stood beholding and the rulers also

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:42.320
with them derided Him saying, notice what they say, He saved others, let Him save Himself.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.680
If He be the Christ, the chosen of God, the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.000
offering Him vinegar and saying, if Thou be the King of the Jews, save Thyself.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.920
Aren't you thankful that He stayed on the cross?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:10.840
He saved others, but He stayed on that cross to save us from sin, to pay the awful penalty,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.000
to shed His precious blood.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.920
I'm so thankful that He stayed on the cross.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.680
We've often said over the years that it was love that held Him there.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.760
He says that He could have called legions of angels.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.120
It was for this purpose that Jesus came to earth.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.480
He came to die.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.000
And the Bible records for us the sufferings of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.480
And Peter says that He is, yes, an elder, but he says, I'm a witness of the sufferings

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.400
of Christ.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.800
And this morning as we take just a few moments and consider the record that God has given,

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.080
of course, you can read in all four of the Gospels, you can read the record of the suffering

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.240
of the cross of Calvary.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.080
I want you to continue thinking about this this morning.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.120
I want you to consider the reason for His suffering.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.559
Yes, the Bible records for us His suffering, but I want you to think about the reason.

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.559
It could be summed up in one word, me.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:23.240
Each of us could say, He suffered.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.240
Why?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240
For me.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.120
I suffered to pay for my sin.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.480
And we find here this morning, turn to the book of 1 Peter, if you will, and I want to

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.760
draw your attention to various aspects of what Peter says before he comes to that fifth

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.080
chapter and says that he is a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.920
I want you to notice that he speaks of the sufferings of Christ prior to that statement

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.400
here in the book of 1 Peter, beginning in chapter number two.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.120
In 1 Peter chapter number two, in verse number 20, notice what the word of God says with

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.320
regard to the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:05.040
It says, but what glory is it if when ye are, ye be buffeted for your faults, you shall

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.240
take it patiently.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:13.320
But if when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.320
with God.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.480
Notice verse number 21, for He even here unto were ye called.

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:28.080
Notice when he says, Christ also suffered for us, Christ also suffered for us, leaving

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.720
us an example that ye should follow His steps, who did no sin, neither was guile found in

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.480
His mouth, who when He was reviled, reviled not again.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.960
When He suffered, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously, who

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:51.040
His own self bear our sins in His own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin should

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.320
live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye are healed.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.279
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.740
of your souls.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:11.120
Look in chapter number three, in verse number 18, where the Bible says this, for Christ

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:22.980
also hath once suffered for sins, the just Jesus for the unjust humankind.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.559
The just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:31.360
but quickened by the Spirit.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.480
That truth of reconciliation, that truth of redemption.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.040
Listen, there's no way for man to be redeemed, but through the precious blood of Jesus Christ,

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.840
that required suffering for you and for me and for humanity.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.559
The Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor.

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:59.520
He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.880
We find the reason for the suffering.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.640
Peter says that He once suffered for our sins, that why, the just for the unjust, that He

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.360
might bring us to God.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.120
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.840
Chapter four, notice what he says in verse number one of 1 Peter chapter four, for as

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.840
much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.559
same mind, for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:34.640
You know, Peter understood that Jesus suffered all that He did in order to pay for the penalty

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.080
of sin.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.200
There's no other payment that was accepted.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.239
God in His wisdom, He had determined before the foundation of the world, Peter deals with

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:49.960
this truth as well, that Jesus is the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960
world.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.400
And we find that God in His grace and His mercy, He had prescribed that this is the

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.119
only way by which man can be redeemed.

00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:08.280
And Jesus was willing to go to that cross to suffer.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:15.720
And Peter says, I'm a witness of the sufferings of Christ, I'm a witness of the sufferings

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720
of Christ.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.480
See, Peter had this understanding that Jesus was fulfilling that which had been prophesied.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.679
In fact, at the end of chapter number two of 1 Peter, really he's referencing there

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:28.559
the truth of Isaiah 53.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:31.600
Hold your place there in the book of, actually we're going to go back to the book of Acts,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.720
so you don't need to hold your place there in 1 Peter, but go over to Isaiah 53, if

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.119
you will, a portion of Scripture that is familiar to many of us.

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:49.359
Isaiah 53, some have described this chapter as being the chapter of the suffering Savior.

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:54.239
And here we find in Isaiah 53, beginning in verse number four, notice the Bible says,

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:59.280
Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.960
Yet, we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.820
Notice he was wounded for our transgressions.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.040
He was bruised for our iniquities.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.800
The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.220
All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:28.100
The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.240
What's interesting for Peter is used by God in the book of Acts as a leader in the first

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.240
century church.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.520
And turn over to Acts 3, if you will.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.800
You find that Peter is understanding even this prophecy that we read of in Isaiah 53,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.640
and it's evidence that he's understanding the fulfillment of this prophecy through the

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.320
suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ as he gives an answer in Acts chapter number 3.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.800
Now Acts chapter number 3, many of you will be familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.680
It's that miracle that takes place when that lame man was laying there at the gate, beautiful.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.440
Remember, Peter says to him, he's asking alms, and he says,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.080
"'Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.920
rise up and walk.'"

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.660
And man, this guy, he was healed, and he's leaping, and he's going, walking, and leaping,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.080
and praising God with them into the temple.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.520
It's interesting in verse number 9, it says,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.280
"'And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and they knew that it was he

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.520
which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.960
and amazement at that which had happened unto him.'"

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.240
In the next passage of Scripture through the end of chapter number 3, we find that Peter's

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.600
going to preach a message, and we find that as he preaches that message, he's going to

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.120
reveal this truth to us that he understood the reason for which Christ suffered.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.560
He'll stand before the religious leaders in chapter number 4 and give testimony with

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.240
regard to the miracle that takes place.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.040
But I want you to see, as he's preaching in verse number 11, it says,

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.280
"'And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.440
unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wandering, and Peter saw it.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.360
He answered unto the people, "'You men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.640
Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.240
man to walk?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.080
No, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.480
his son Jesus.'"

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:38.120
Remember, I said this in 1 Peter 5.1, before the glory is the suffering.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.040
He says that, "'The God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.000
up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.240
But ye denied the Holy One and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto

00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:00.400
you, and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400
witnesses.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:08.440
And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.880
Yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.960
of you all.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.360
And now, brethren, I want that through ignorance he did it, as did also your rulers.'"

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.760
Notice in verse number 18, "'But those things which God before had showed by the mouth of

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:32.320
all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.'"

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.240
Listen, this morning, as we think about the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ, we consider

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.420
this morning the record that God has given us.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.620
We consider this morning the reason for his suffering.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:51.980
And as we understand the truth of God's Word, we understand that Peter, yes, he is a witness

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.900
of the sufferings of Christ, and we find that he makes that declaration.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.380
We've not witnessed it firsthand, but we have the record of it.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:10.660
And we understand the truth that Jesus Christ, God in flesh, he did it all for me.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.340
He suffered.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.380
This morning, when we speak about suffering, when we think about suffering, and there are

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.580
some in our midst that have suffered greatly, you've dealt with difficulty, but can I tell

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.500
you this morning that the greatest that we could suffer really pales in comparison to

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:33.180
what Jesus Christ suffered for our redemption.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.860
He suffered it all, why?

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.340
Because he loved me.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.740
How appropriate the song that Kimberly and Pierre played this morning, how deep the Father's

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740
love.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:54.740
Oh man, I think about the love of God as it's demonstrated on that cruel cross, the suffering

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.740
for me and for you.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:01.980
I want you to think about, as we finish up this morning, the result of this suffering.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.140
Of course, we know it's redemption, but turn back to the book of Luke, if you will.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:13.180
We kind of walked our way through, skipping along some passages here in the book of Luke,

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.340
and we ended up there in chapter 23, and looking at that suffering.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:27.660
Notice if you will, in chapter 23, in verse number 46, verse 45 says that the sun was

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.260
dark and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst, and verse 46 of Luke 23, when Jesus

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.380
had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit, and having

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.820
said thus, he gave up the ghost.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.100
He died.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.340
He died.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.380
The burial is recorded beginning in verse number 50 and down through the end of the

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:55.820
passage, and we understand that chapter 24, the beginning of this chapter, it records

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.180
for us the glorious truth of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, when

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:06.140
He conquered sin, death, and the grave, and hallelujah for the resurrection.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.260
But I want to move down past the testimony of the resurrection, I want you to move down

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.740
to verse number 26, if you will.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.180
Here in verse number 26, we're jumping right into the dialogue that Jesus is having with

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.540
these disciples on the road to Emmaus.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.020
You remember that these disciples on the road to Emmaus, they're saddened, they take this

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.900
journey, they've left Jerusalem, and it's almost a seven-mile journey, and Jesus comes

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:38.820
and He begins to walk with them, and they're just saddened, and Jesus questions them about

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.780
their sadness, and they say, are you a stranger in Jerusalem?

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.140
You're not aware of the things that have happened?

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.580
And He asked them, what things?

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.220
In verse number 19, they begin to declare the things that have happened, and He says

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:57.340
in verse 25, then He said unto them, O fools and slow of heart, to believe all that the

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:05.820
prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.820
His glory?

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:13.020
It says that beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.980
Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.420
And what a lesson that must have been.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.620
Can you imagine?

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.420
And we find that they constrained Him to stay because He was going to keep on going after

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.020
they got home, and they said, no, the hour's late, come on, and He goes in and they're

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:35.660
going to eat, and He took the bread, He blessed it and break it, and the Bible says that their

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.700
eyes were opened, and then He vanished out of their sight.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700
You know what they did?

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.460
They walked back to Jerusalem, almost seven miles.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.380
Jared, you did 16 miles yesterday, and Tim, I think, they did a 16-mile hike yesterday,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.980
these guys almost did that.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.980
Go back to Jerusalem.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.020
You know, they go back with a testimony.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.380
He is risen indeed, and exciting.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.020
Go down to verse 46, if you will, actually pick it up in verse 44, and He said unto them,

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:12.260
Jesus now speaking, these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.780
that all things must be fulfilled.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:20.120
Remember we started as Peter gave that testimony that he's a witness of the sufferings of Christ,

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.560
and it was there after the declaration when Jesus said, who do men say that I am?

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.240
And some say John the Baptist, some Isaiah or Jeremiah, one of the other prophets, but

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.640
whom say ye that I am?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.520
And after Peter had given that bold declaration, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:43.520
God, it was at that time that Jesus began to reveal to them, to show unto them the things

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.200
that He must suffer.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.960
And He says here in verse 44, these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:57.600
with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses and

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.400
the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.360
Then opened He their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, and He said

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.760
unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, to rise from the

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:18.640
dead the third day, that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in His name among

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.600
all nations beginning at Jerusalem, and ye are witnesses of these things.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.120
You know what I find in Peter?

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.000
I find a man that, remember Jesus said to him in a couple of chapters earlier how that

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.440
He was going to deny him.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.800
And He said, listen, Peter, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.320
But He says this, but I have prayed for thee.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.360
And then He says this, and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:56.880
And Peter, John records in John 21 that encounter when Peter and John are there.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.320
It's interesting in the gospel account.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.520
of the resurrection, how that He says,

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.520
go sell the disciples, and Peter.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.940
And Peter, as he hears these words,

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.100
remember as we read there just a moment ago

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.320
in Acts 3, he said we're witnesses of these things.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.280
And then in 1 Peter 5, in verse 1,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.000
he says that I am a witness

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.840
of the sufferings of Christ.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.760
And he says, Jesus says to them,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.380
here, listen, it was written

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.180
and thus it behooved Christ, in verse 46,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.140
to suffer, to rise from the dead the third day.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.020
And then notice the result of this.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.860
Yes, it's redemption and salvation

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.040
because now mankind can be saved

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.740
and we see that the truth is given,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.420
that repentance and remission of sin

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.060
should be preached in His name among all nations,

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.100
beginning at Jerusalem,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.040
and you're witnesses of these things.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.580
The end here of Luke 24 reveals to us,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.620
it records for us the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.420
If you're trying to trace the timeline,

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.360
it's in connection there with Acts 1.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.260
And you see that Peter,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.100
he's embraced this responsibility that he has.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.740
Yes, he's a witness, but he understands the result

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.320
that redemption has now been paid for.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.460
The price of redemption, the blood of Christ,

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.900
all the way back in Genesis,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.980
the prophecies regarding the blood that would be shed

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.980
and all of those sacrifices that were done day after day.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.500
Remember, Hebrews 10 speaks about those that would stand,

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.780
those priests that would minister daily,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.380
offering the same sacrifices that could never take away sin.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.140
But this man, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever,

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.500
sat at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:57.580
And we find here that Peter is being used by God.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.700
He's testifying.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.380
I'm a witness of the sufferings,

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.620
and let me help you understand that as we testify

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.580
of the sufferings,

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.540
as he's writing to the believers in 1 Peter,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.500
he did this for you.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.980
He suffered for us.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.020
This is what he did.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.740
Notice, if you will, in 2 Corinthians 5.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.420
In 2 Corinthians 5,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.420
we've read in 1 Peter about the reason for his suffering.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.820
We find that he suffered for our sin.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.500
Here, the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 5 in verse 21,

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.500
for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.540
Notice the last part of this verse,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.220
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.060
That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.620
There's no other way for mankind to be declared righteous,

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.420
but through the imputed righteousness

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.980
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.620
In fact, Isaiah says this,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.740
that all of our good works are as filthy rags.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.100
As man goes about trying to establish

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.340
his own righteousness, he fails utterly.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.220
The Bible says that we've all come short,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.220
that we're all sinners,

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.540
and we understand that from Romans chapter number three,

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.460
and we find the result of the suffering

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.420
is that we now can be saved.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.860
And those of us that are here this morning

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.740
that have been saved,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.820
we can rejoice greatly

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.700
in the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.420
It should cause us to,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.140
even as I read the passage of Scripture,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.020
to be choked up.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.700
To think about what he did for us.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.060
He's God, but he did it for us.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.340
I wanna close with this thought

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.420
from Hebrews chapter number 12.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.260
Turn there if you will.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.380
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.900
we'll make application and be done this morning.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.820
In Hebrews chapter number 12,

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.740
Hebrews 12.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.420
Beginning in verse number one.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.380
Hebrews 12 and verse number one,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.220
the Bible says,

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.100
we're foreseeing we also are encompassed about

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.100
with so great a cloud of witnesses.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.779
Let us lay aside every weight

00:34:22.779 --> 00:34:24.779
and the sin which doth so easily beset us

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:26.140
and let us run with patience

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.020
the race that is set before us.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.140
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.460
notice this,

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.339
who for the joy that was set before him

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.500
endured the cross,

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.700
despising the shame

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.220
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.820
For consider him that endured such contradiction

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.740
of sinners against himself,

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.500
lest you be wearied and faint in your own minds.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.820
I want you to think about the word suffer is not here,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.820
but when you think about the truth that is being written,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.500
when it talks about he endured the cross,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.820
despising the shame,

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.500
verse three says that he endured such contradiction

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.860
of sinners against himself.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.380
I think that it's fair that we could say that he suffered.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.779
We read it all over the place

00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:14.740
in all sorts of passages of scripture

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.100
that we've looked at even this morning.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.580
And though the word is not there,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.580
we see this suffering,

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.179
but I wanna draw your attention

00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:22.100
where the Bible says in verse number two,

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.500
that looking unto Jesus,

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.700
the author and finisher of our faith,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.540
but it says this,

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.460
for the joy that was set before him.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.339
He endured the cross.

00:35:31.339 --> 00:35:34.020
He endured that suffering.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.860
Why?

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.660
For the joy that was set before him.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.460
He understood that because of that suffering,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.460
that suffering precedes glory.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.300
And that if there's no death on the cross,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.220
there's no resurrection.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.700
If there's no death on the cross,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.100
there's no atonement.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.700
The substitutionary atonement

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.339
that God speaks of all throughout his word,

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.300
that the just dies for the unjust,

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.140
that we find ourselves in that position,

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.420
that he has taken our place.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.260
And he suffered for me.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.300
He suffered it all because he loved me.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.140
And this morning,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.619
when we think about the glorious truth of this message,

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:16.820
I wonder this morning,

00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:20.220
how does it really impact us?

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.059
Two thoughts.

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:24.100
Number one, we should rejoice greatly.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.339
I mean, we ought to just take some time

00:36:26.339 --> 00:36:30.500
and just really thank God for our salvation.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.220
I understand this morning that in a sense,

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.140
my salvation cost me nothing,

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.140
but it cost him everything.

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:42.140
Cost him everything.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.179
When I think about,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.220
go back and read all four gospel accounts

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.980
of the crucifixion.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.059
I couldn't do it publicly this morning,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.580
but you go back this afternoon

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.300
and you read all four gospel accounts

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.100
of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.100
As you read it,

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:08.059
as the tears flow down your cheeks,

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:08.980
just thank him.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.500
Rejoice greatly.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.460
Because he did it all for me.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.860
Personally, you say that he did it for me.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.860
What joy should flood our souls?

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.500
Amen?

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.740
Preacher friend said this.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.660
He said, speaking about the importance

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.540
of rejoicing in our salvation, for our salvation,

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.500
he said, there are days that we as believers

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.100
have tough days.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.540
He said, but on our worst of days,

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.860
I'm still going to heaven.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.420
I'm still going to heaven.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.700
Amen?

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.619
Think about that.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.140
The suffering.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.020
We're witnesses.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.020
But then I want you to think about

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.660
how it impacted Peter.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.860
Peter, he says in John 21, I go a fishing.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.059
He's there with the Lord Jesus Christ

00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:08.540
after they caught nothing.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.420
Jesus said, I have prayed for thee

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.820
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.380
When you read of the life of Peter in the book of Acts

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.420
and you read as he's testifying and ministering

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.700
to these believers in first and second Peter,

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.820
you see a man that is compelled

00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:27.100
to tell others about Jesus Christ

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.300
and about his suffering for them.

00:38:32.299 --> 00:38:35.380
You know, this morning, we are privileged

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.700
to know this truth.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.179
Honestly, it doesn't make us better.

00:38:42.059 --> 00:38:43.340
It makes us accountable.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.780
When I think about that this morning,

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.020
listen, I'm so thankful that I'm going to heaven one day.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.619
I don't know when it's gonna be.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.419
But one day, for every single one of us

00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:58.780
that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.340
our personal Savior, heaven is real.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.500
Heaven is real.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.340
But there's a whole lot of people in our world

00:39:11.539 --> 00:39:15.220
that they don't know about the sufferings of Jesus Christ.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.059
They don't know what he did on the cross of Calvary

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:21.780
or why he did what he did on the cross of Calvary.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.619
I remember speaking to a man when I,

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:27.780
I say a man, we were just teenagers, we were kids.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.900
Y'all teenagers are kids, amen.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.979
You know, the older you get,

00:39:30.979 --> 00:39:34.619
the more you refer to kids that aren't really kids,

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:35.460
but you call them kids.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.700
There's like this 20-something-year-old.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.500
I found myself yesterday saying to Brianna,

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.580
yeah, this kid over at the store,

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.179
and I was like, actually, it was probably like 24,

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:43.820
but you know, I guess now he's a kid, you know?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.700
And some of you, you look at me as a kid, I get it.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.380
But the reality is that I was a senior in high school.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.020
I had just been saved, not long.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.619
Been saved for just probably a month at the most.

00:39:56.619 --> 00:39:59.539
And we're sitting at a lunch table as a senior.

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:03.779
senior in high school, and there's this kid that was sitting there.

00:40:03.779 --> 00:40:06.979
My brother was a sophomore, and so we had lunch together.

00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:11.179
Actually, I had lunch together almost every day in my senior high school, and there was

00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:14.659
a kid that was in his class, and he was sitting there with us, and I began to talk to him

00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:16.539
about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:25.979
And I began to talk to him about how Jesus died for him, and he had a very skewed perspective

00:40:25.979 --> 00:40:30.179
with regard to the death of Christ on the cross of Calvary, and that it was not a willing

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:37.619
sacrifice, but that it was a Roman authority that forced him.

00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:42.539
And I began to share truth with him, some of what I shared this morning.

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:47.779
Listen, Jesus did it all because he loved us.

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:52.179
Those Romans, remember what he said to Pilate, you have no authority, no power unless I give

00:40:52.179 --> 00:40:55.579
it to you, right?

00:40:55.579 --> 00:41:00.939
He could have called legions of angels, but Peter says, I'm a witness of the sufferings

00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:02.619
of Christ.

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:09.539
This morning, we weren't there physically to be eyewitnesses, but in a sense this morning,

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:13.379
if you'd allow me to say it, we are witnesses of his suffering.

00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:14.659
Amen?

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:21.019
We know that he suffered, and we know why he suffered.

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:28.339
And I trust this morning that it would not only lead us to a place of rejoicing greatly,

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:37.659
thanking him, having this increased level of gratitude for our redemption, but it would

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:43.699
lead us to, God, would you help me to share this wonderful message with someone?

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:50.979
I believe that as we begin to pray that way, God would delight in answering that prayer.

00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:57.579
I challenge you this morning, I'm challenging myself, that we would say, God, would you

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:07.259
give me the opportunity in these next couple of weeks to share with someone the truth of

00:42:07.259 --> 00:42:11.139
why you suffered on the cross of Calvary?

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:13.419
Would you give me the opportunity?

00:42:13.419 --> 00:42:19.559
As we pray specifically, I believe God will answer that prayer, begin to look for those

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:22.579
opportunities that He would present to us.

00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:27.379
See during this time, and I understand we're in a different time in our country's history.

00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:33.619
There was a time when Easter, man, people that never went to church would be in church.

00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:39.699
That's becoming less and less of a situation.

00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:45.139
But there still are some people out there that have some idea of what Easter is really

00:42:45.139 --> 00:42:47.899
all about.

00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:52.499
Not that they've trusted Christ, not that maybe they know all of it, but this time of

00:42:52.499 --> 00:42:57.459
our calendar gives us an opportunity.

00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:01.979
And I'm praying, and I want to ask you this morning to pray specifically, maybe to come

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:07.179
to this altar and say, God, would you give me in these next couple of weeks, give me

00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:17.739
a divine appointment, give me an opportunity to speak of your sufferings and why you suffered.

00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:21.019
Thank Him for your redemption, absolutely.

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:28.299
Read the passages, weep and rejoice that He loved you so much that He was willing to suffer

00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:30.459
in the manner in which He did.

00:43:30.459 --> 00:43:35.259
But then go tell someone of this great truth.

00:43:35.259 --> 00:43:36.259
Let's pray.

00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:37.539
Father, we love you.

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:44.179
Thank you for loving us.

00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:52.179
My heart is overwhelmed this morning, just thinking about the statement of Peter, a witness

00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:57.139
of the sufferings of Christ.

00:43:57.139 --> 00:44:11.819
As we read the account leading to the cross and then the cross itself, thank you.

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:16.579
Thank you for being obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:25.699
Rejoice in the resurrection before the glory is the suffering.

00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:34.059
We understand that you did it all for me, personally, each one of us can say that.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:41.699
I pray this morning that you'd help us to have a level of motivation to go and share

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:43.499
this truth with someone.

00:44:43.499 --> 00:44:50.859
God, would you help us, each of us, to pray specifically about that opportunity, that

00:44:50.859 --> 00:44:52.619
divine appointment.

00:44:52.619 --> 00:45:01.139
I pray, God, that you'd move and work, open doors, lead our path, that we might share

00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:09.979
with someone the sufferings of Jesus Christ, why He suffered the way that He did, of course,

00:45:09.979 --> 00:45:16.739
leading to the glory of His resurrection, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:45:16.739 --> 00:45:20.699
I pray that you would guide and direct in these moments of invitation.

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:25.099
If there's one in our midst that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, we pray that

00:45:25.099 --> 00:45:28.099
today would be the day of their salvation.

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:31.859
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
