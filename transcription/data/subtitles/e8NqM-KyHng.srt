1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
the message this evening, and maybe a threefold warning.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,119
Number one, have your fingers ready,

3
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:08,939
we got lots of passages of scripture to go to.

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,479
Number two, if you're taking notes,

5
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,560
plan for more than one page.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,920
And number three, if you have to leave early,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
it won't offend me.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,600
And I say that in all sincerity,

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,899
it probably, it may, it's one of those things,

10
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,600
sometimes as a preacher you think,

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,719
there's gonna be a long message,

12
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,639
and then all of a sudden it's not a long message,

13
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,360
and you think this is gonna be a short one,

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
and all of a sudden it's a long one,

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,479
and so I'm just giving you some heads up warning,

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,959
and trust that the message this evening will be a blessing,

17
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,459
and my heart was encouraged.

18
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:43,720
We're continuing with the Ask the Pastor series,

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,299
and I've titled the message,

20
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,119
as you see in the bulletin today,

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,119
from John chapter number 10, Tell Us Plainly.

22
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,639
And you'll understand as I give you the question

23
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,700
as we read the text of scripture,

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,240
and the question that I wanna answer this evening

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,080
is prefaced with this statement,

26
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,680
and it's important that I make that note,

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
because the individual that asked the question

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,160
did preface the question by saying this,

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,480
Jesus is God, and we can rejoice in that, amen?

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,239
That is settled Bible truth,

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,080
and we ought to rejoice in that.

32
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,959
The question continues and says this,

33
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,699
yet the gospel so consistently refer to Jesus,

34
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:27,699
not explicitly as God, but by other names like son of God.

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,860
Why does the Bible seem, that's a good word,

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,860
why does the Bible seem to mask this fundamental truth?

37
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,800
And I think that's a very good question,

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,400
and you understand I've said this over the years,

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,519
that if you get it wrong with Jesus, you get it wrong.

40
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,959
Most of the cults of the world,

41
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,199
actually all the cults of the world,

42
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,680
false religions of the world,

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,959
they get it wrong with who Jesus is.

44
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,760
And we'll look at the passage of scripture

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,580
later this evening as we study through this message,

46
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,099
where Jesus say, whom do men say that I am?

47
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,819
And then he looks at the disciples and says,

48
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,339
whom say ye that I am?

49
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:06,419
And the reality is that understanding

50
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:09,539
who Jesus is, is essential.

51
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,460
And we find that as we come to the word of God,

52
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,699
it's interesting as we think about the question

53
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,220
that was asked this evening,

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,860
and we notice in our text of scripture

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,699
in John chapter number 10, beginning in verse number 22,

56
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,440
the Bible says, and it was at Jerusalem,

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,539
the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

58
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,740
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

59
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,539
And notice in verse 24, that the Jews come,

60
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,779
that says, then came the Jews round about him.

61
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:40,179
And so he was often interacting with the people of the day.

62
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,460
And we find that they ask him a question

63
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,139
here in verse number 24.

64
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,339
And notice what they say.

65
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:51,339
How long dost thou make us to doubt?

66
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,300
If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

67
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,339
All right, it's a great question, is it not?

68
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,899
And they say, if thou be the Christ,

69
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,339
and we understand and we'll look at this in more detail,

70
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:10,100
but the title Christ refers to his deity.

71
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,300
It refers to him being Messiah,

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,020
the promised one, the anointed one.

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,339
And so they say to Jesus, they say,

74
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:22,100
if you are the Christ, tell us plainly.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,860
Look at the response of Jesus Christ in verse number 25.

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,240
Jesus answered them, I told you,

77
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,339
and ye believed not.

78
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,580
The works that I do in my Father's name,

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,259
they bear witness of me.

80
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,779
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep,

81
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,660
as I said unto you.

82
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,220
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,619
and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life,

84
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,380
and they shall never perish,

85
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,899
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

86
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,179
My Father which gave them me is greater than all,

87
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,380
and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

88
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,860
I and my Father are one.

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,899
Keep in mind the question of verse 24.

90
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,899
When the Jews say to Jesus,

91
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,660
if thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

92
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,660
That word plainly means without concealment.

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,779
That word plainly means openly or frankly.

94
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,500
And so we understand what they're asking.

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,700
They say, if you're the Christ, tell us plainly.

96
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,220
And notice that Jesus says, I told you,

97
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,579
and ye believe not.

98
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,820
Now keep that in mind,

99
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,420
and turn to the book of Matthew, if you will,

100
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,739
as we keep this thought from John 10

101
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,059
in our minds this evening.

102
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,220
And I want you to look at the Gospel of Matthew,

103
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,380
and let's seek to gain further insight

104
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,179
here in Matthew 11.

105
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,899
Matthew 11, and notice what the Bible says

106
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,019
here in verse 25.

107
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,899
In Matthew 11, in verse 25,

108
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
notice the Bible says,

109
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,380
at that time Jesus answered and said,

110
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,899
I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,

111
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,459
because Thou hast hid these things

112
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,299
from the wise and prudent,

113
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,140
and hast, notice this word,

114
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,260
revealed them unto babes.

115
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight.

116
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,660
All things are delivered unto Me of My Father,

117
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,420
and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father.

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,140
Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,459
and He to Whomsoever the Son,

120
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,260
you see the word again, will reveal Him.

121
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,700
Now that word reveal means to make known.

122
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,619
That word reveal means to uncover,

123
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:46,980
to make bare, to disclose,

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,299
or to make manifest.

125
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,299
And so we find that here,

126
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,660
Jesus says that He is revealing.

127
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,940
Notice it says that He says that you've hid these things

128
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,220
from the wise and prudent in verse number 25,

129
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,619
but hast revealed them unto babes.

130
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,899
Now look at Matthew chapter number 16.

131
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,459
And notice here, the same word revealed

132
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,859
is going to be used in our text of Scripture.

133
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,619
And I want you to notice in Matthew 16,

134
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,859
and beginning in verse number 13,

135
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,940
I gave note of this passage just a moment ago,

136
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,859
but Jesus came into the coast of Caesarea Philippi.

137
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,859
He asked the disciples, He said this,

138
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:27,260
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

139
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,820
Now that's a title that we will define here

140
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,779
in just a moment that is used of the Lord Jesus Christ.

141
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,700
And they said, the disciples respond to Jesus

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,140
in verse number 14, and they say,

143
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,299
some say that thou art John the Baptist,

144
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:44,100
some say Elias, others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

145
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,859
It was commonly thought amongst those

146
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,140
that were living during the day

147
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,140
that Jesus was either John the Baptist, remember Herod?

148
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,500
He thought that John had risen from the dead

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,820
because he had beheaded John.

150
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
He decided to go see Jesus.

151
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,179
And we find that there were some that had the idea

152
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,459
that Jesus was Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets.

153
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,820
And notice Jesus then says in verse number 15,

154
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,619
but whom say ye that I am?

155
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:12,220
Peter stands up.

156
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,980
It says that Simon Peter answered and said,

157
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,980
thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

158
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:23,339
I want you to notice verse 17.

159
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,220
And Jesus answered and said unto him,

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,059
blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah,

161
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:32,140
notice this, for flesh and blood

162
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,179
hath not revealed it unto thee, revealed what?

163
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:40,179
Who Christ is, but my Father, which is in heaven.

164
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,380
So as we begin to think about this text of Scripture

165
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,980
this evening and the question that was asked,

166
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,899
and we begin to look at the truth of John chapter number 10

167
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,859
when they say, tell us plainly,

168
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:58,779
and Jesus says, I have, I've told you, but you believe not.

169
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,579
And we look here in Matthew chapter number 11

170
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,299
and Matthew chapter number 16,

171
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,380
and we see how that these things were hidden

172
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,739
from those that claim to be wise and prudent,

173
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,500
but they were revealed unto babes.

174
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,739
And we find here that Jesus expressly told Simon

175
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:18,459
that it was the Father that had made this known,

176
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:23,459
that He had revealed this truth to Peter.

177
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,579
Now it's important that we define a few terms

178
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,100
or titles, if you will.

179
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,140
The first one is the word deity.

180
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,820
We hear the word deity often.

181
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,979
We use the word deity or that term,

182
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,460
and it refers to the Godhead.

183
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,260
It refers to divinity.

184
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,739
It is the nature and essence of the Supreme Being.

185
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:42,940
That's what the word deity means.

186
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,979
So when you hear someone, you hear a preacher,

187
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,820
you read in a theological book,

188
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,359
and you read about the deity of Christ,

189
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,419
they're talking about the divinity,

190
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,539
the fact that Jesus is God.

191
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,219
So we think about some of the titles

192
00:08:57,219 --> 00:09:00,659
that are ascribed to Jesus within the Gospels.

193
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,580
One of them is Son of God.

194
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,380
That term Son of God, that title,

195
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,380
is revealing to us the deity and the equality

196
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,260
that Jesus has with the Father,

197
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,900
that He is co-equal, He is co-eternal,

198
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,500
and we thank the Lord for that.

199
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,460
The term Son of Man, and we noticed here in Matthew 16

200
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,900
that He says, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

201
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,820
It's interesting because this is a term

202
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,260
that is used by Daniel in Daniel 7 in verse number 13,

203
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,140
and we find that Jesus will use that term

204
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,340
throughout the Gospel records in referring to Himself,

205
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,200
and really, when you think about the term Son of Man,

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,400
there's an emphasis there upon His humanity.

207
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,820
Now, understand the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ.

208
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,780
In fact, when we use the title Jesus Christ,

209
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,020
we understand that Jesus is referring to His humanity,

210
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,340
and Christ is referring to His.

211
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,420
deity, that He is the Messiah, He is the Anointed One, and so we see often the

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,740
term Jesus Christ referred to, and we understand His humanity and His deity.

213
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:20,900
We've often said that Jesus Christ is 100% man and 100% God. You say, well I

214
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:29,020
don't understand that. God transcends us. Amen? And to try to bring God down to our

215
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,820
understanding really is lifting us up in a certain way, and we understand,

216
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,980
listen, if I could understand all there is to know about God, is He really God?

217
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,300
Right? You understand what I'm saying? In this evening, we begin to think about the

218
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,540
title Son of Man and the emphasis upon His humanity. You understand that the

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:57,160
Bible is extremely clear that Jesus had to take on human flesh. He came after the

220
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,160
seed of Abraham, according to Hebrews chapter number 2, in order to redeem

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,960
fallen man. And we think about the deity of Christ, the fact that He's 100% man

222
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,520
and 100% God, we find that throughout the Gospels that Jesus reveals to

223
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,600
those that He is ministering amongst that He is the Lord, He is Christ, He is

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,760
the Messiah. We find that He was sleeping on the boat. That reveals to us His

225
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,560
humanity, right? And then we see His deity when He says, peace be still. The

226
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,240
God-man. And we find this evening that I would argue that the evidence of deity

227
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,760
in the Gospels is overwhelming, and that evidence reveals without any doubt that

228
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,680
Jesus is in fact God. This evening, and really we can understand this in the day

229
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:06,600
and age we're living, anyone can claim to be anything, right? That's what this new

230
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,160
philosophy of the world that we're living in. You just claim whatever you

231
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,360
want to be. I joked with somebody on Friday, I was driving to a conference and

232
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,560
I wanted to get into the HOV lane, but I was by myself. I couldn't. I'm just an

233
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,400
individual. No matter what our society says about what you can claim, I'm just

234
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,500
an individual. And the reality is that anyone can claim anything, but what does

235
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,040
the evidence say? What does the evidence say? And this evening, as we think about

236
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,640
the evidence within the Gospels, the evidence of the deity of the Lord Jesus

237
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,840
Christ, it is overwhelming, and it proves without a shadow of a doubt that Jesus

238
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,520
is God. Paul is there in Thessalonica, and you don't need to turn there, but in

239
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,400
Acts 17, if you want to jot down the reference, Paul is there in Thessalonica,

240
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,720
and the Bible tells us in this passage of Scripture that Paul goes in to the

241
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,560
on the Sabbath day, he goes there and he's in the synagogue of the Jews, and

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,400
the Bible tells us in verse number two, and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto

243
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:25,160
them in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and

244
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,160
alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead,

245
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,880
and that this Jesus, they knew who he was as a man, they knew who Jesus...remember

246
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,320
what he says as he stands before the leaders? This thing wasn't done in a

247
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,880
corner. They knew who Jesus was. He says, this Jesus whom I preach unto you is

248
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:53,280
Christ, and we find again the importance of defining the titles and Jesus

249
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,360
referring to his humanity and Christ to his deity, and so we look at what

250
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,440
the Word of God says, and we look here as to the question that was raised in John

251
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,080
chapter number 10. If you are the Christ, tell us plainly, and Jesus says, I did, but

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,920
he didn't believe me. If you're taking notes this evening, that was a long

253
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,280
introduction, but if you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice first

254
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,680
of all the clear teaching of Scripture. Turn to the fifth chapter of the book of

255
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,520
John, if you will, John chapter number 5, and I'm gonna read a lengthy passage of

256
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,880
Scripture beginning in verse number 18. In John chapter number 5, beginning in

257
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,080
verse number 18, many of you would be familiar with the miracle that takes

258
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,320
place at the beginning of John chapter number 5. They're at the the the pool

259
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,880
there of Bethesda, and the man, the impotent man, meets the omnipotent God,

260
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,640
and he's healed, and this thing was done on the Sabbath, and the Bible tells us in

261
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,620
verse number 18, therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him. Notice what

262
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,460
it says, because he not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was

263
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,220
his father. Notice what they understood that to mean, making himself equal with

264
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,660
God. He is equal to God. He's God, and they were ready to kill him. Notice the Bible

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,380
tells us, beginning in verse number 19, it's a lengthy passage. I believe it's

266
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,340
necessary to read the entirety of it, and I'll make common as we go through.

267
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,260
Beginning in verse number 19, the Bible says, then answered Jesus and said unto

268
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,180
them, verily, verily, of a truth of a truth, verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son

269
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,340
can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do. For what so

270
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,620
things, what so, for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son

271
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,620
likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself

272
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,300
doeth, and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel. For

273
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,660
as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son

274
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,660
quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all

275
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,700
judgment unto the Son. That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor

276
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,260
the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father, which hath sent

277
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:19,220
him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him

278
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,700
that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is

279
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,780
passed from death unto life. Aren't you thankful for that wonderful truth? Verily,

280
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,300
verily, verse 25, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is when the dead shall

281
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,540
hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. For as the

282
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,500
Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in

283
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,660
himself, and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the

284
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,620
Son of Man. So you've seen the title, Son of God, Son of Man. Notice verse 28,

285
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,340
marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the

286
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,300
grave shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good

287
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,180
unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the

288
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,460
resurrection of damnation. I can of mine own self do nothing, as I hear I judge,

289
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,780
and my judgment is just. Aren't you thankful for that? God's judgment is just.

290
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,220
Listen, we live in a time of corrupt justice, amen? But our God is just, and

291
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,140
his judgment is just. Has nothing to do with the message, but it's important to

292
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,220
know, amen? Notice, continue with me, it says, because I seek not mine own, the

293
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,260
middle of verse number 30, mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath

294
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,060
sent me. Notice, beginning in verse number 31, notice where he says, if I bear

295
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,460
witness of myself, my witness is not true. Now understand, Jesus is not saying that

296
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,420
he's not giving a true witness. Understand that in verse number 31,

297
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,700
basically what Jesus is doing is saying, okay, you don't want to hear my witness?

298
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,340
Fine, I'll give you another witness. That's what Jesus is saying. Jesus is not

299
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,980
saying, I haven't told you the truth. He's saying, you aren't receiving what I've

300
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,140
told you, and so I'm gonna give you more witness. I'm gonna give you more

301
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,260
evidence of the truth that I've revealed to you. Notice in verse number 32, there

302
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,460
is another that beareth witness of me, and I know that the witness which he

303
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,300
witnesses of me is true. Now, it says he's gonna start talking about John, and I

304
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,740
want you to be mindful of this, and I'm gonna stop right in the middle of the

305
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,740
passage in order to read two Old Testament verses of Scripture, because I

306
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,580
think it's important to know, as Jesus is dealing with these religious leaders,

307
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,100
these Jews that would have been familiar with the Old Testament, he is going to

308
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,940
provide them with, as we think about the clear teaching of Scripture, he's gonna

309
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,260
provide them, number one, with a three-fold witness. And that's significant,

310
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,059
because in Deuteronomy chapter number 19, as they're preparing to enter into

311
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,740
the land, and the law is being given really a second time here in the book of

312
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,700
Deuteronomy, in Deuteronomy 19 and verse number 15, I want you to notice what the

313
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,460
Word of God says with regard to witnesses. The Bible says this in

314
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,340
Deuteronomy 19 and verse number 15, one witness shall not rise up against a man

315
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:19,860
for any iniquity or for any sin, and any sin that he sinneth. At the mouth of two

316
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,700
witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be

317
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,180
established. Okay, now we keep that in mind, look at the book of Ecclesiastes, if

318
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:40,380
you will, look at the book of Ecclesiastes, and I want you to notice in

319
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,100
Ecclesiastes chapter number four,

320
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,820
Ecclesiastes chapter number four and verse number 12, and if one prevail

321
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:01,940
against him, two shall withstand him. Notice, a threefold cord is not

322
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,440
quickly broken.

323
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,740
As we come to John 5,

324
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,860
Jesus is going to provide these Jewish people

325
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,660
with a three-fold witness.

326
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,700
He says, listen, you won't listen to my witness.

327
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,900
You're claiming that my witness isn't true,

328
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,280
so I'm going to give you first the witness of John.

329
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,240
Specifically, John the Baptist,

330
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,980
not the Apostle John.

331
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,900
John the Baptist.

332
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,240
Notice in verse 32, back in John 5,

333
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,000
there is another that beareth witness of me,

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,240
and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me

335
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,040
is true.

336
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Ye sent unto John, and he beareth witness

337
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,080
unto the truth.

338
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,120
But I receive not testimony from man,

339
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,040
but these things I say that ye might be saved.

340
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,840
Listen, this witness of John the Baptist

341
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,200
wasn't somehow going to help Jesus

342
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,280
understand who He was.

343
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,080
He knew that He was God.

344
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
He knows who He is.

345
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,380
He knows of the glory that He had with the Father

346
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,800
from the beginning of the world,

347
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
and He says that this testimony of John

348
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,720
is not really for His sake,

349
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,040
but it's for their sake that they might be saved.

350
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,380
He says He was a burning and a shining light,

351
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,040
and you were willing for a season to rejoice in His light.

352
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,380
So number one, as we think about the three-fold witness,

353
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,160
it's the witness of John the Baptist.

354
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,040
But then he goes into the second witness.

355
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,459
Remember what John the Baptist said

356
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,959
when he saw Jesus afire?

357
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:32,420
He said, behold, the Lamb of God

358
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,620
which taketh away the sin of the world.

359
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,300
John bore witness of Jesus, who He was.

360
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,020
He says, listen, there comes one after me

361
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,940
who is preferred above me.

362
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,959
He said, I'm not worthy to even loose

363
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,340
the latchets of His shoes,

364
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,380
and we find that John gave witness.

365
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,700
Notice, the witness number two

366
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,880
of this three-fold witness is the witness of the works.

367
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,720
In verse number 36, it says,

368
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,959
but I have greater witness than that of John.

369
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:05,000
For the works which the Father hath given me to finish,

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,040
the same works that I do bear witness of me

371
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,979
that the Father hath sent me.

372
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,440
What works is he speaking of?

373
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,839
Well, the miracles.

374
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,960
You've been to study the miracles,

375
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,800
and you find how the miracles are bearing witness

376
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,279
that Jesus is the Christ, that He is the Messiah.

377
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,820
He is the anointed one, He's the promised one,

378
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,979
and in fact, as you think about the witness

379
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,139
of John the Baptist, when he was in prison,

380
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,380
he sent the disciples, and he said,

381
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,699
hey, go to Jesus and find out,

382
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,860
is He the one, or do we look for another?

383
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,779
And Jesus didn't just say, yes, I'm the one.

384
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,860
He said, go back and tell John

385
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,660
that the blind can see, that the lame can walk,

386
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,139
that the deaf can hear.

387
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:46,979
What is He doing?

388
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,940
He's saying the Old Testament prophecies,

389
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,940
they prove that I am Christ, that I am God.

390
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,020
That was the answer that John the Baptist received

391
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,180
when he sent those witnesses, and what a great answer.

392
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,820
We find that Jesus is giving the witness of the works,

393
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,680
and you think about the great miracles,

394
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,660
and you think about how the witnesses

395
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,279
to these great miracles, they stood,

396
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,380
and they wondered, and they marveled at times.

397
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,740
They said, we've never seen it like this before.

398
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,020
The miracle that we've been studying

399
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,460
for the last few weeks in John 9,

400
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,600
in our Sunday school class, our family Sunday school class,

401
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,360
the man that was born blind,

402
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,680
and you think about that great miracle,

403
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,400
and you think about the interrogation

404
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,000
of the religious leaders, and all that's taking place,

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,800
and he says, listen, I was blind, but now I see.

406
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,320
And the people couldn't stop talking about it.

407
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,040
You read in John 10, and you read in John 11,

408
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,919
that they're referencing about the man that was blind

409
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,020
that could now see the miracles, the works.

410
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Jesus gives the third of this threefold witness,

411
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,820
and it's the witness of the Father.

412
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,220
In verse number 37 of John 5, he says,

413
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,860
and the Father himself which hath sent me

414
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,619
hath borne witness of me.

415
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,600
Ye have neither heard his voice at any time,

416
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,300
nor seen his shape, and I want you to think about the truth.

417
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,380
Remember, Jesus, as his baptism,

418
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,339
this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,

419
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:25,019
the Father spoke.

420
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,100
We're mindful as we have the whole canon of Scripture

421
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,160
at the Mount of Transfiguration.

422
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,119
Peter, James, and John are there,

423
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,660
and Peter thinks, man, Jesus, and Moses, and Elijah,

424
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,540
let's put some three tabernacles here,

425
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,580
and all of a sudden, they hear the voice of God,

426
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,420
and no longer do they see Moses and Elijah,

427
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,080
but they just see Christ.

428
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,679
We begin to think about the raising of Lazarus from the dead.

429
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Jesus prayed before he said, Lazarus, come forth,

430
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,720
and do you know why he prayed?

431
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,959
For those that were around him.

432
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:02,360
He prayed, it says in John 11, in verse number 41,

433
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,399
that Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,

434
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:07,480
Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me,

435
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,320
and I knew that thou hearest me always,

436
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,160
but because of the people which stand by, I said it,

437
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,580
that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

438
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
He's not hiding anything.

439
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,059
It's just that they didn't believe.

440
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,679
The witness, the threefold witness, John the Baptist,

441
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,940
the works, the miracles, the Father.

442
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,860
Notice as you continue reading in verse 38,

443
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,619
it says, and ye have not his word abiding in you,

444
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,420
for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

445
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,380
What a powerful verse of Scripture in John 5, in verse 39.

446
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,540
Search the Scriptures,

447
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,779
for in them ye think ye have eternal life,

448
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,779
and they are they which testify of me.

449
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,459
And you will not come to me that ye might have life.

450
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,500
I receive not honor from men,

451
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,459
but I know ye that ye have not the love of God in you.

452
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,739
I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not.

453
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,420
If another shall come in his own name,

454
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,619
him ye will receive.

455
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:15,179
How can you believe which receive honor one of another

456
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,420
and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?

457
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,619
Do not think I will accuse you to the Father.

458
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,739
There is one that accuseth you, even Moses,

459
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:24,500
in whom ye trust.

460
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,980
For had ye believed Moses, you would have believed me.

461
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,619
For he, Moses, wrote of me.

462
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,260
But if ye believe not his writings,

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,899
how shall ye believe my words?

464
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,980
He was getting right to the heart of the matter.

465
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,540
These people, we know that God spoke by Moses.

466
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,100
That's what they'll say in just a little while.

467
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,220
But as for this man, we don't know about where he came from.

468
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,019
We're the disciples of Moses.

469
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:55,459
Jesus says, listen, if you believed Moses,

470
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,580
you'd believe me, because Moses wrote of me.

471
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,739
If you don't believe his writings,

472
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,619
how shall you believe my words?

473
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,179
And so we see the clear teaching of Scripture,

474
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:10,100
number one, the threefold witness.

475
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,779
Number two, I want you to understand

476
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:14,660
the clear teaching of Scripture that Jesus forgives sin.

477
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,860
Turn to the book of Mark, if you will,

478
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,179
and notice in Mark chapter number two,

479
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,260
and we're familiar with the passage of Scripture,

480
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,220
the miracle of the man that was born of four,

481
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,420
and I'm gonna not deal with the bulk of the miracle.

482
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,260
I just wanna kinda get down to verse number eight and nine

483
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,320
and following.

484
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,299
Actually, let me back up to verse number five,

485
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,820
because Jesus saw their faith,

486
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,179
and he said unto the sick of the palsy,

487
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,420
son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

488
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,619
Now, this caused a problem,

489
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,380
for Jesus said, thy sins be forgiven thee.

490
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,339
And notice after he made this comment

491
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,299
that there were certain scribes that were sitting there,

492
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,100
and the Bible tells us in verse number six

493
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,179
that they were reasoning in their own hearts.

494
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:57,860
And here's what their reasoning.

495
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,220
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?

496
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,660
Who can forgive sins but God only?

497
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,739
They were right.

498
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:06,420
Only God can forgive sins.

499
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,179
Only God can forgive sins.

500
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,700
And immediately when Jesus perceived in the Spirit

501
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,380
that they so reasoned within themselves,

502
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,059
now, can you imagine?

503
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,860
They weren't even making this verbally known.

504
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,380
There was no audible discussion.

505
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,779
They were reasoning within themselves, in their hearts,

506
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,779
and Jesus knows their thoughts,

507
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,260
and Jesus then addresses and says,

508
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,860
why reason ye these things in your hearts?

509
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,899
How would you feel?

510
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,340
Convicted?

511
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,979
How does he know what I'm thinking?

512
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:38,280
Notice what he says.

513
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,580
Whether it is easier to say to the sick of the palsy,

514
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,659
thy sins be forgiven thee,

515
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,859
or to say, arise and take up thy bed and walk.

516
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,059
Then notice the statement in verse number 10.

517
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,700
But that ye may know,

518
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,840
and then notice the title, that the Son of Man.

519
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,260
We talked about that title.

520
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,700
Daniel used it in Daniel 7,

521
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,059
the emphasis upon the humanity of Jesus Christ.

522
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,580
Why did he take on human form?

523
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,659
Why did he take on human flesh?

524
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,739
So he could redeem mankind.

525
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,580
And he said, so that you can know,

526
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,539
so that you have this knowledge,

527
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,340
but that ye may know that the Son of Man

528
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,500
hath power on earth to forgive sins.

529
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,840
So he's saying that to these religious leaders,

530
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,679
to these scribes.

531
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,299
He's looking directly at them,

532
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,179
and he says, so that you know

533
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,619
that I have power to forgive sins.

534
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,260
And then he turns his attention

535
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,059
to the man that was sick of the palsy,

536
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,220
and he said unto him, arise, take up thy bed,

537
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,580
and go thy way into thine house.

538
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,140
And immediately he arose,

539
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,539
took up the bed, and went forth before them all.

540
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:38,900
Now that's a great miracle.

541
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,320
But understand what Jesus is revealing

542
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,260
to these religious leaders.

543
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,820
He says, listen, you properly understand

544
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,059
that only God can forgive sins.

545
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,220
But so that you understand who I am,

546
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,460
I'm gonna say to him, take up thy bed and walk,

547
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,099
thus proving that I am Christ,

548
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,099
that I am Messiah.

549
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:08,459
that I am God." Clear teaching of Scripture, not only the threefold witness, the fact

550
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:13,039
that Jesus forgives sin, but notice also with me if you're taking notes, number

551
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,619
three, that Jesus receives worship. Jesus receives worship. Turn over to Matthew 4,

552
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,659
if you will. In Matthew chapter number 4, we have Matthew's account of the

553
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:28,299
wilderness temptation. Remember when Jesus was led of the Spirit into the

554
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:31,619
wilderness for the purpose of being tempted? And we come to Matthew chapter

555
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:34,899
number 4, and we find that there's great truth that is given to us with regard to

556
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:40,459
the temptation and the attack of the enemy, and how Jesus replied each time it

557
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:45,079
is written, and how important for us to learn that powerful lesson of using the

558
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,659
Word of God, the sword of the Spirit, with skill and accuracy. And we find that

559
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,699
Jesus then comes on this third occasion, notice in verse number 10, verse number

560
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:57,259
9, and notice it says, and say then to him, all these things will I give thee,

561
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:03,579
notice, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. That's what Satan says to

562
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:13,539
Jesus. Then saith Jesus unto him, get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, thou shalt

563
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:21,859
worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. It's true that only God

564
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:29,699
is to be worshiped. Amen? It's a biblical truth. Only God is to be worshiped. And we

565
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:35,499
understand that He is alone worthy of our worship. And we think about the truth

566
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:41,739
that even as Jesus is speaking here in this time of temptation, He says to Satan,

567
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:46,019
listen, it's written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God. But I want you to

568
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,739
understand that Jesus, during His earthly ministry, regularly received

569
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:57,459
worship. And never one time do we see where He's rebuking those that would

570
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:04,859
come to worship Him. It began at His birth. Matthew chapter number 2. Notice,

571
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:11,099
they ask the question, beginning in verse number 1, now when Jesus was

572
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:14,739
born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came

573
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:18,819
wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying, where is he that is born king of

574
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:24,139
the Jews? We find that there was discussion that took place and they

575
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:28,619
leave and the star guides them. You come to verse number 10, and when they saw the

576
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:32,419
star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were coming to the

577
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:38,059
house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and notice, and fell down and

578
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:52,179
worshipped Him. Not them. Him. Amen? No Mary worship. Amen? Worshipped Him. At His

579
00:32:52,179 --> 00:33:00,659
birth. He's king. He took on human form. Amen? Philippians chapter number 2, He

580
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,099
humbled Himself. He took on that human form so He could go to the cross of

581
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:12,619
Calvary to redeem mankind, but He never stopped being God. He's king. He receives

582
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,299
worship. Notice in Matthew 8. Matthew 8, you're doing well. We're gonna go late. I

583
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,539
hope you're okay. Matthew 8, I didn't get to preach this morning, so we'll just

584
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,339
blame it on that. Amen? Matthew 8, in verse number 1, it says, when He was come down

585
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:30,619
from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. In verse 2, and behold, there

586
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:39,059
came a leper. What's it say? And worshipped Him. And worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if

587
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:46,779
Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. He worshipped Him. Chapter 9, in verse

588
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:51,379
number 18. Just keep walking with me here through the book of Matthew. In chapter

589
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:55,299
9, in verse number 18, while He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a

590
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:01,339
certain ruler and worshipped Him. And worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is

591
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:07,299
even now dead, but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and she shall live. You know,

592
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:12,099
those that attack the deity of Christ change the word worship. You go study it

593
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:18,659
out. They change the word worship because they want to attack the deity of Christ.

594
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,819
Same Greek word all the way through the New Testament. They use worship in

595
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:28,819
Matthew 4, where we started, where Jesus says, you should only worship God. But

596
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:35,899
when Jesus receives worship, they change the word. They change it to obeisance,

597
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:44,819
reverence. That's not the same as worship. Amen? And notice Matthew 14, in verse 33.

598
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,899
Matthew 14, in verse number 33, notice what the Word of God says. This is the

599
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,899
disciples. Remember, He's walking there. The wind was contrary. The storm, they're

600
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,859
tossed to and fro. They're, they're toiling and rowing. And Jesus says, be of

601
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,899
good cheer, it is I, be not afraid. Peter says, if it's really you, bid me come to

602
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:08,019
thee. And Jesus says, come. And of course, we know that Peter sank, and Peter had

603
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:13,419
enough sense about him to say, Lord, save me. And Jesus delivered Peter as he cried

604
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:17,699
out. And the Bible tells us that they were back on the ship, and the, the wind

605
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:23,259
ceased, according to verse number 32. Then, in verse 33, they that were in the

606
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:35,299
sheep, ship, came and worshiped Him, saying of a truth, thou art the Son of God. Notice

607
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:50,139
in chapter 15, in verse number 25, this woman was bothering the disciples. The disciples

608
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:56,099
said, Jesus, can't you hear her send her away? She's driving us crazy. Because Jesus

609
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:03,019
didn't answer her the first couple of times. The Bible says that Jesus finally answered

610
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,999
her in verse 24 and said, I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

611
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:15,499
And then she came in verse 25 and worshiped Him. Notice what she says, Lord, help me.

612
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:23,739
Lord, help me. She worshiped. Notice in chapter 28, after the resurrection of our Savior,

613
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:29,299
His, He's been arrested. He's been on that cruel cross. He was buried in that borrowed

614
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,979
tomb, and He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave. And the announcement of His

615
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:39,859
resurrection is given to us in the beginning of Matthew 28, that the angel said, He's not

616
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:44,099
here, for He is risen, as He said, come, see the place where the Lord lay. And then, in

617
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:50,019
verse number 9 of Matthew 28, the Bible says, and as they went to tell His disciples, behold,

618
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:57,819
Jesus met them, saying, all hail, and they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped

619
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:03,499
Him. Skip down to verse number 16, then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into

620
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:10,139
a mountain where Jesus had appointed them, and when they saw Him, they worshipped Him.

621
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:17,139
But some doubted. They worshipped Him. Only God is to be worshipped. The clear teaching

622
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:25,459
of Scripture is that Jesus received worship. In John chapter number 9, we find that it

623
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:29,979
was here in John 9 with the man that was born blind, and all of the discussion that's

624
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:35,019
going on, and the interrogation, and His strong witness, and Jesus comes and reveals Himself

625
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:40,739
to this man near the end of the passage of Scripture. Jesus had found out that they had

626
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:45,379
cast Him out, and it says in verse number 35 of John 9 that Jesus heard that they had

627
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:49,759
cast Him out, and when He had found Him, He said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son

628
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:55,639
of God? He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him? And Jesus

629
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:02,639
said unto him, Thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee. Notice the

630
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:10,479
response, Lord, I believe, and He worshipped Him. Jesus receives worship. The clear teaching

631
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,559
of Scripture.

632
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:20,559
Number 2, notice the claim of Jesus. So often people will make the statement, Jesus never

633
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:28,519
claimed to be God. That's false. Jesus very much, in fact, claimed to be God. The religious

634
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,319
leaders of the day knew exactly what Jesus was claiming. Notice in John chapter number

635
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,940
4, we'll look at a number of examples. John chapter number 4, the woman at the well, remember

636
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:49,659
Jesus said, I must pass through, I must needs go through Samaria. The woman saith unto him

637
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:56,419
in John 4 in verse number 25, the woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which

638
00:38:56,419 --> 00:39:03,419
is called Christ. When He is come, He will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her,

639
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:10,500
I that speak unto thee am He. That's pretty plain, is it not? She says, I know that Messiah

640
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:18,339
is coming. I know that Messiah is Christ. She knew some truth about the Old Testament

641
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:25,339
and Jesus says, that's me. Pretty plain. Notice in John 8, we're familiar with this one, it's

642
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:34,859
one that we often will quote in John 8. These religious leaders, of course, they're talking

643
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:41,419
about Abraham at this particular time and Jesus talks about the fact that Abraham rejoiced

644
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:45,299
to see my day and that really messed them up because they said unto him in verse number

645
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:52,299
57, thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen Abraham. And Jesus saith unto them,

646
00:39:54,419 --> 00:40:01,419
verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am. Now, who did God really want to

647
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:10,739
reveal Himself to as I Am, to Moses. Is Moses before or after Abraham? Moses is after Abraham,

648
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:17,959
right? Easy chronological study of the Scriptures, Moses is after Abraham, but Jesus says before

649
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:26,199
Abraham was, I Am. Notice the response in verse 59, then took they up stones to cast

650
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,479
at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of

651
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:32,959
them and so passed by. Why did they want to kill Jesus? Because He was claiming to be

652
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:40,999
God. That got them worked up. They knew exactly what Jesus was claiming. Can I tell you that

653
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:44,519
the Old Testament prophecies were not that Jesus would die by stoning, but He'd go to

654
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:49,319
a cruel cross. And so there's no possible way that Jesus could allow Himself to be killed

655
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:55,879
by stones, amen? So therefore He had to escape in this manner. By the way, that happened

656
00:40:55,879 --> 00:41:02,119
on more than one occasion. Notice in John chapter number 10. It's interesting, this

657
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,439
is the same passage in which they said, tell us plainly, and He said, I told you and you

658
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:10,999
believe not. I read the entirety of the passage at the end of verse number, at the end there

659
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:16,799
at verse number 30, He says, I and My Father are one. That's a pretty simple claim, is

660
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:23,759
it not? Jesus said, I and My Father are one. Notice the response again in verse 31, then

661
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:28,519
the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. At this time Jesus said unto them, many good

662
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,719
works have I showed you from My Father, for which of these works do you stone Me? Notice

663
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:37,959
what they said. The Jews answered Him saying, for a good work we stone thee not, but for

664
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:49,199
blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. That's pretty plain,

665
00:41:49,199 --> 00:42:01,159
is it not? Jesus said, I and My Father are one. John 18, John 18, this is in the garden,

666
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:08,679
the arrest in the garden. In John chapter number 18, Judas knew the place, according

667
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,839
to verse number 2, he knew the place, why? For Jesus oft times resorted thither with

668
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,279
His disciples. Notice in verse number 4, Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come

669
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:22,839
upon Him, went forth and said unto them, Whom seek ye? It's a pretty simple question,

670
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:26,239
is it not? This great group of people come and they're seeking Jesus. He says, Whom

671
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,239
seek ye? They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Notice this. Now, I want you to understand,

672
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,719
and I hope this doesn't bother you, and I'd be more than happy to talk to you later about

673
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,679
this. You understand, and even the translators of the King James Bible make this very clear

674
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:45,759
in the introduction in their letter to the readers, that the italicized words are there

675
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:50,639
for the readability of the Scripture. When you translate something from one language

676
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,119
to another language, sometimes there's not always a word that correlates. And so sometimes

677
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,719
the readability of the particular language that you're going to can be very difficult

678
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,839
and choppy, if I could use that terminology. And so they used, in order to distinguish

679
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,679
the words that were not going to be found in the Hebrew or the Greek or the Aramaic,

680
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,959
they used italicized words. Now, they didn't do that in 1611 because of the bold and so

681
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:21,319
on and so forth, but it was very distinct as to the typeset that they used, and then

682
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:25,739
eventually in our Bibles today, you'll see the italicized words. Why do I make that clear

683
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:30,119
to you? Because notice what happens in verse number 5. When they, He said, Whom seek ye?

684
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,599
In verse number 4, and they say, Jesus of Nazareth. Notice His response. If you take

685
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:47,159
out the italicized, what does He say? I am. I am. What did God say to Moses? Moses says,

686
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:54,799
Who should I tell whom sent me? And God said, I am that I am. Right? Now, what happens when

687
00:43:54,799 --> 00:44:00,599
Jesus says, these people come into the garden to arrest Him, and Jesus says, I am. And notice

688
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:06,559
what it says. As soon as they, in verse 6, and as soon then as He had said unto them,

689
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:21,639
I am, they went backward and fell to the ground. In Mark chapter number 14, chronologically

690
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:29,759
it's next after John 18, the arrest in the garden, in Mark 14, Jesus is standing before

691
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:36,519
the high priest Caiaphas. And as He's standing there before the high priest, He's being questioned,

692
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:45,279
and in verse number 61 of Mark 14, it says this. Mark 14 and verse 61, speaking of Jesus

693
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:50,599
that He held His peace and answered nothing, again the high priest asked Him and said unto

694
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:59,359
Him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? That's a pretty straight question. Jesus said,

695
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:07,319
I am. I am. And ye shall see the Son of Man, that title that was referenced, sitting on

696
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,639
the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven. Can you imagine? And notice

697
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:18,159
the response. Then the high priest rent his clothes and saith, What need we any further

698
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:23,079
witnesses? Ye have heard the blasphemy. What think ye? And they all condemned Him to be

699
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,279
guilty of death. And some began to spit on Him and to cover His face and to buffet Him

700
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:33,039
and to say unto Him, Prophesy. And the servants did strike Him with the palms of their hands.

701
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,239
Can I tell you from verse number 65 that Jesus knew the exact names of the people that hit

702
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,639
Him when they did? And wouldn't it have been something if Jesus started calling out their

703
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:52,839
names? Because He's God. Caiaphas was beside himself when He asked Him plainly, Are you

704
00:45:52,839 --> 00:46:01,079
the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? I am. I am. Notice in Revelation 1, and I know this

705
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:08,599
isn't the Gospels, but I want you to see what the Apostle John is writing to us in Revelation

706
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:18,799
1. I am nearing the end. In Revelation 1, we understand that the book of Revelation

707
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:26,279
and perhaps the title in your Bible says, The Revelation to John, and that should be

708
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:30,999
proper. If it says, The Revelation of John, it almost gives the idea that John's giving

709
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:36,079
this revelation, but it's the revelation to John because it's the revelation of Jesus

710
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,379
Christ, according to verse number 1. There's a difference there. It says this, The Revelation

711
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:45,319
of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him to show unto His servant things which must shortly

712
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:50,479
come to pass. We don't have time to read all of it. Notice in verse number 2, it says,

713
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:54,039
Who bear record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all

714
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:59,119
things that He saw. Notice what Jesus says. We know that He's speaking about Jesus. In

715
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,439
verse number 5, it says, And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten

716
00:47:03,439 --> 00:47:07,799
of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto Him that loved us, and washed

717
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:14,159
us from our sins in His own blood. Who shed their blood? Jesus Christ. How could He shed

718
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:22,639
His blood? Because He's Jesus Christ. He's a 100% man, and He's a 100% God. If He did

719
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,639
not take on human flesh, if He did not come after the seed of Abraham, He could not shed

720
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:33,159
His blood. He could not redeem us. And so, it's speaking expressly of Jesus that makes

721
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:38,399
it extremely clear, abundantly clear. It says, And hath made us kings and priests unto God

722
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:45,359
and His Father, to Him, to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. Behold,

723
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,319
He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see Him. And they also which pierced Him in

724
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:58,639
all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen. I am Alpha and Omega,

725
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:06,259
the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come,

726
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:13,619
the Almighty. Verse 11, He says again, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.

727
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,939
What thou seest, write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia,

728
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:22,459
unto Ephesus, unto Smyrna, unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto

729
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:30,459
Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. He is Alpha and Omega. He's God. He's God. So, we see

730
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:35,019
the clear teaching of Scripture. We see the claim of Jesus. And I'll finish with this

731
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:41,899
thought this evening, number three, the confession of Thomas. The confession of Thomas. Look

732
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:50,459
back in John chapter number 20, if you will. In John chapter number 20, we find that Jesus

733
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:58,500
has already risen from the dead. It's revealed to us in the beginning of this chapter, the

734
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,779
resurrection. We find that the disciples were gathered together according to verse

735
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:10,739
number 19, but Thomas was not there. By the way, after what happened, I don't think Thomas

736
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:17,619
ever missed another gathering. Amen? And chew on that for a little while. Thomas wasn't

737
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:22,179
there, and he says, I will not believe at the end of verse number 25, because they told

738
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:28,139
him that Jesus had came to them. And it says in verse 26, and after eight days again his

739
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:35,339
disciples were within, notice it says expressly, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the

740
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:42,059
doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, peace be unto you. Then saith he to

741
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:49,380
Thomas, by the way, our God is so gracious. He is so merciful. Our God wants to reveal

742
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:56,579
Himself. He's come to manifest Himself. We read the gospel accounts. Remember we used

743
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:04,059
that word reveal there in Matthew 11, and Matthew 11, and Matthew 11, and Matthew 11,

744
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:09,279
chapter number 16, He told them in John 10, He said, they said to Him, tell us

745
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:15,439
plainly, He said, I've told you. Listen, Jesus is so gracious and so merciful and

746
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:19,859
He, knowing what has transpired, as He comes to this place where they're

747
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:25,079
gathered together, He focuses attention upon Thomas and notice, He says, reach

748
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:33,239
hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand and thrust it

749
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:39,039
into my side, and be not faithless, but believing. Why did Jesus do that? Well,

750
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:44,039
Thomas had said to them in verse number 25, the other disciples therefore said

751
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,959
unto Him, we have seen the Lord, but He said unto them, except I shall see in His

752
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:50,999
hands the print of the nails, and put my fingers into the print of the nails, and

753
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:59,239
thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe. And Jesus says, Thomas, Thomas,

754
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:06,559
reach thither thy finger and behold my hands. Isn't God so gracious? He's such a

755
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:13,599
loving God. He wants to make Himself known to this lost world and He will use

756
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:21,279
us as His representatives, as His spokespeople, to reveal Christ, to let

757
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:27,199
them know who He is. And He says to Thomas, be not faithless, but believing.

758
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:32,439
Notice the response of Thomas in verse number 28, and I think that he says it

759
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:39,599
with great excitement and emotion. Thomas answered and said unto Him, my Lord and

760
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:53,119
my God. What a confession. Do you notice that Jesus answered him and says, Thomas,

761
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,479
in verse 29, because thou hast seen me thou hast believed, blessed are they that

762
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:04,239
have not seen and yet have believed. There's a glaring absence in verse

763
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:13,360
number 29. It's the absence of any correction. If Jesus is not God, surely He

764
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:19,479
would have corrected Thomas. Amen? If someone came to you and called you God,

765
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:26,440
would you let them think you were God? How'd that work for Herod? He got eaten

766
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:35,239
by worms. Case study. Amen? Not a good deal. What happened when John is there in the

767
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,919
Revelation? He's gonna bow down and worship. No, no. The angel says, no, no.

768
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:43,520
Worship God. Listen, Jesus does not correct Thomas. Why? Because there's no

769
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,440
correction needed. When Thomas says, my Lord and my God, he was rightly

770
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,399
recognizing what Jesus had revealed to him, that He is God, that He is Messiah,

771
00:52:56,399 --> 00:53:03,039
that He is Christ. We find that as the Word of God continues in John chapter

772
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,919
number 20, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, the Apostle John says

773
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,399
this at the heels of this great revelation. It says, in many other signs

774
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:19,080
truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this

775
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,479
book, but these are written. Why are these written? That you might believe that

776
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:30,679
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life

777
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:36,759
through His name. The purpose of John, according to these verses, that you might

778
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:40,599
believe, and he says that these things have been written for the purpose of

779
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,319
revealing, for the purpose of manifesting the truth. The truth of what? The truth

780
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:56,199
that Jesus is God. The evidence is overwhelming, and I believe the evidence

781
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:08,160
clearly reveals to us that Jesus is God. They said in John 10, tell us plainly. He

782
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:16,639
says, I have. I told you, and you believe not. Jesus said in Matthew 11 and Matthew

783
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:24,799
16, it's the Father that has revealed these things. It's not that God has

784
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:35,600
masked the truth. God has very clearly revealed the truth, and it's not just in

785
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,480
someone making a claim. Listen, there was some guy over in Israel like six months

786
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,919
ago that was claiming the Messiah. He had all kinds of people following him. Listen,

787
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:52,320
you can claim whatever you want to claim. Jesus did claim to be God, but He also

788
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:57,200
revealed it through all of these things that we've looked at this evening, and

789
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:05,959
the evidence is overwhelming. Jesus said, I told you, but you believe not. This

790
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:11,320
evening, I hope that we're believing and that we're recognizing that the Word of

791
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:20,519
God, listen, God, the Word of God is, it's a treasure field. There's some things

792
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,000
that are surface, but there's a whole lot of things that you got to dig in for.

793
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,200
Amen? And we find that as we dig into the Word of God, that God gives us these

794
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:37,600
great treasures, these great truths. This evening, I believe that it's abundantly

795
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:45,000
clear, as you study the Gospels, that Jesus indeed is God. I understand the

796
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,559
question began with that statement, Jesus is God. There's an understanding, but

797
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,760
seemingly, to be masked. I hope this evening that we've been able to, through

798
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,519
the study of the Gospels, recognize that indeed it was not masked, but it was made

799
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:07,959
known plainly. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank

800
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:16,160
You for the Word of God. Thank You for revealing the truth of Your Word to us.

801
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:21,279
God, I pray that if there's one present here that's tuned in live stream that has

802
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:26,519
not been settled on this truth, that does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their

803
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:35,200
personal Savior, God, I pray that tonight they would get it settled. They would

804
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:40,359
recognize that Jesus is God, that He is the Messiah, the Promised One, the

805
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:46,279
Anointed One. He took upon that human flesh so that He could die in our place

806
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:52,600
to pay a sin debt that we could never pay, a debt that He truly did not owe, but

807
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:59,000
a one that He willingly paid. Oh, if there's one tonight that's not sure of

808
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,519
heaven, God, we pray they'd be saved. I pray for every child of God tonight. Lord,

809
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,880
I pray that You would help our faith to be increased. I pray that as we've

810
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,959
studied so much this evening, various passages, that God, You'd help us to be

811
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:17,559
settled and grounded in the faith. Help us not to be tossed to and fro with any

812
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:22,359
wind of doctrine. Help us to be ready to give an answer to every man that asketh

813
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:27,079
of the hope that lieth within us. Help us, Lord, to earnestly contend for the faith.

814
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:33,279
I pray that as we have a time of invitation that You'd help us. Lord, help

815
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:40,440
us to just rejoice in having the Bible. Rejoice in the fact that You've revealed

816
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:48,119
Yourself to us. Help us to rejoice in our salvation. Help us, God, to make commitment

817
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,559
to be faithful witnesses of these things. I pray that as we have this moment of

818
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,399
invitation that You'd move and work as only You can. We'll thank You for it. In

819
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:02,559
Christ's name we pray.
