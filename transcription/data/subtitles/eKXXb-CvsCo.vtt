WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
this evening, John chapter 21.

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.400
You say, pastor, I thought we were in the book of Revelation.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.280
Well, we were and we are.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.359
And I'll remind you the last study last Sunday night

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.560
was the teen takeover.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.960
But the week before, we finished up

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.520
looking at the letter to the church of Ephesus.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.040
We dealt with the church in Ephesus.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.000
And we found, as we studied the last two weeks ago,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.719
that the Lord corrected the believers in Ephesus

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.600
for this reason, because they left their first love.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560
The Lord said, nevertheless, I am somewhat against thee.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
And we find that as we begin reading that correction

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.119
to the church at Ephesus and the instruction

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.240
for what they were to do and how they were to respond

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.560
in dealing with that, I wonder this evening,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.200
if it was true of the believers in Ephesus

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.400
that they had left their first love in the first century,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.240
if it was true of them, and if Jesus said it,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.799
then it was true, amen, I wonder this evening,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.299
how many other believers are guilty

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.300
of leaving their first love over the last 20 centuries?

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:12.379
I don't know the number, you don't know the number,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.800
but we know that God is aware of how many

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.000
he would say to as he did to the church of Ephesus,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.839
you've left your first love.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:23.599
I believe that the Lord knows and I believe

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.720
that the Lord is faithful to use his word

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.839
to bring conviction to the heart of the individual

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.519
that would be guilty of leaving their first love.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.540
I'm reminded at the end of the letter

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.580
to the church of Ephesus and to each of the churches,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.400
we find these words, he that hath an ear,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.360
let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.599
We find that this letter must have caused

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.599
the believers in Ephesus to pause, to examine,

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.080
to be able to have that process of answering the question,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.519
do I really love God?

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.040
Do I love God with all my heart?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.479
Remember what the Bible says there in John 21,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.440
we'll be there in just a moment,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.360
but let me read to you a couple of verses

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.080
in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter six

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.360
in verse number five, the Bible says this,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.399
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.360
with all thy soul and with all thy might.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.839
We find a few chapters later in Deuteronomy 10

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.119
in verse number 12, the Bible says this,

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.720
and now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.800
but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.740
and to love him and to serve the Lord thy God

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.320
with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.880
So we begin to think about this subject matter this evening,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.679
I wanna preach a message that I've simply entitled,

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.000
loving God with all your heart.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.440
Loving God with all your heart.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.679
I've invited you to turn to John 21,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.779
because I wanna review this evening,

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.839
the interaction that God gives us in John chapter 21

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.960
between the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.580
our resurrected Savior with Peter.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.460
And in John 21, beginning in verse number 15,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.660
notice what the Bible says,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.419
I'll read verse 15 down through verse number 19,

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.300
and then we'll get into the message this evening.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.660
In verse 15, the Bible says,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.660
so when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:34.059
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.440
He saith unto him, yea, Lord,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.039
thou knowest that I love thee.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.800
He saith unto him, feed my lambs.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.639
He saith to him again the second time,

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.119
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.240
He saith unto him, yea, Lord,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.699
thou knowest that I love thee.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.679
He saith unto him, feed my sheep.

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.440
He saith unto him, verse 17, the third time,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.160
Peter was grieved.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.080
It means to have a heavy, sorrowful, broken heart.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.360
He was grieved because he said unto him the third time,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.480
lovest thou me?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.839
And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.079
By the way, that's a convicting truth.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:26.100
God knows all things.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.320
We can say whatever we wanna say, but God knows.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.559
In fact, when we get to the letter

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:31.320
to the church of the Laodiceans,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.739
he says, you say, but here's what I say.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.239
Notice, Lord, thou knowest all things.

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:38.720
Thou knowest that I love thee.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.399
Jesus saith unto him, feed my sheep.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.079
Verily, verily, I say unto thee,

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.239
when thou wast young, thou girdest thyself

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:48.040
and walkest whither thou wouldest,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.119
but when thou shalt be old,

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:51.959
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.119
and another shall gird thee

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:55.679
and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:58.239
This spake he, signifying by what death

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.480
he should glorify God.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.119
And who had spoken this, he saith unto him, follow me.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.140
I want you to think about this interaction,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.100
this evening between the resurrected Christ and Peter.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.220
And I want you to just pause for a moment

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.299
and put yourself in the account

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.299
that we've read in John chapter 21.

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:20.260
And I want you to think about Peter,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.220
who Peter is and what Peter has professed

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.420
over the time that we have the opportunity

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.299
to read the gospel messages and the gospel accounts

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:34.339
of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.799
And it's this Peter that we find

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.880
that as he was a fisherman,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.760
that Jesus said to him, cast out,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.000
go out into the deep and launch out, right?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.279
And let down your nets for a draft of fishes.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.959
And Peter went out, he said,

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.880
we've told all the night, nevertheless,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.679
that thy word will let down the net, singular.

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:58.440
And he goes out and they have a great draft of fishes.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.279
I mean, it's a great miracle of the Lord.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.320
And we find that it's at that moment

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.279
that Jesus says to Peter, follow me,

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.119
and I will make you fishers of men.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.920
It's Peter that stood there at Caesarea Philippi

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.399
when Jesus said, whom do men say that I am?

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.279
And then he says, who do you say that I am?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.399
And it's Peter that stands up with the power of God.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.519
And he says, thou art the Christ,

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.720
the son of the living God.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.519
We find that in John chapter six,

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:32.720
when all those that were following forsook the Lord

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.839
and Jesus says to the disciples,

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.040
will you go also?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.519
And it's Peter that stands and says,

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:42.359
Lord, we know that you are the Christ.

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:45.040
You have the words of eternal life.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.119
Where are we gonna go?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.320
And it's Peter that on the night before Jesus was crucified,

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.760
that Jesus tells Peter that he's going to deny him.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:04.600
And it's Peter that says in Matthew 26 and verse 33,

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:06.399
he answered and said to Jesus,

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.160
though all men shall be offended because of thee,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.679
yet will I never be offended.

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:17.279
And we know that over the course of the next several verses

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:21.760
of Matthew 26, that much transpires.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.799
And eventually we read how Peter denied the Lord thrice.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.119
We read at the end of the chapter,

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.959
how that the Lord and Peter, their eyes met.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.799
And the Bible says that he went out and he wept bitterly.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.519
Because he recognized what had happened in his life.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.320
And I think is looking at this passage of scripture

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.920
this evening and dealing with the subject

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.040
of loving God with all of our hearts.

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:53.119
It's this Peter.

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:55.079
See what happens sometimes in our life

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.880
is we kind of get like Peter in Matthew 26 and 33

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.640
and say, not me.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.040
It's not gonna happen to me.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.160
I mean, I'm never gonna not love you like I should.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.760
I'm never gonna be guilty of what the church of Ephesus

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.399
was guilty of leaving their first love.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.160
No, not me.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.880
Peter said, Lord, I'm not gonna do that.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.839
I'll never deny you.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.440
I'll never be offended.

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:22.720
I'll go with you unto the death.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.079
And I think he meant well,

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:27.320
I think he was sincere in what he was saying.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.239
But we have an enemy.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.880
Remember what Jesus said in Luke?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.599
He's desired to sift you as wheat.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.479
As I look at this passage of scripture this evening,

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.799
and I deal with this subject matter of loving God

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.159
with all of our hearts,

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:47.359
I want you to consider a few thoughts

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:48.960
from these few verses of scripture.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.520
Number one, when we talk about this interaction,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.359
I want you to note that this interaction was personal.

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:56.520
This interaction was personal.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.159
Go back to the beginning of John 21.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:00.280
It might be on the same page for you.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.280
But we find that according to the opening statements

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.440
of John chapter 21.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.719
Now remember in John 20,

00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:07.640
that's the truth of the resurrection, right?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.799
That's when they saw the resurrected Christ.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.799
And Thomas wasn't there the first week.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:15.080
And then Thomas was where he was supposed to be.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.039
And he saw Christ.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.599
And we come to chapter 21.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.239
And the Bible says, after these things,

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:21.359
Jesus showed himself again to the disciples

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:22.440
at the Sea of Tiberias.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.880
That's the Sea of Galilee.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.559
And on this Y showed he himself.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:29.479
Notice verse two, there were together Simon Peter

00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:30.679
and Thomas called Didymus,

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.840
and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.719
and the two sons of Zebedee,

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.880
and two other of his disciples.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.679
So there are seven disciples,

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.239
according to verse number two, that are there.

00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:43.000
The Bible tells us in verse number three,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.840
that Simon, notice it says,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.840
Simon Peter said unto them, I go a fishing.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:53.159
They say unto him, we also go with thee.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:56.239
They went forth and entered into a ship immediately.

00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:59.719
And that night they caught nothing.

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:03.999
But I want you to notice what happens over the next few verses. I'm not gonna read all of them

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:10.279
I'm gonna pick through notice in verse number five when Jesus shows up. It was morning according to verse number four

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:11.759
He stood on the shore

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:18.319
The disciples knew not that it was Jesus, but notice in verse 5. It says then Jesus saith unto what does it say?

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.799
them

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:23.839
notice with me in verse number 10 Jesus saith unto

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.839
them

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:28.719
Notice in verse number 12 Jesus saith unto

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:31.599
Them is them singular or plural

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:36.599
Amen, we're tracking. Amen English class tonight. It's plural

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:39.839
He said unto them according to verse number two

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.919
There were seven disciples Peter looks at them and says I go a fishing

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.159
according to verse number three and they

00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:52.359
Plural say we're going with you and we find that when Jesus shows up when he's on the shore

00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:54.119
They knew not that it was Jesus

00:10:54.119 --> 00:11:00.359
He said unto them and he's addressing them as a group the seven of them

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.679
But I said to you that the interaction was personal because notice in verse 15

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:08.919
So when they plural the whole of the group had dined

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.399
Jesus saith

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:13.399
to Simon Peter

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:19.199
We must recognize tonight that our God is a personal God

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:25.239
He cares about us individually, I'm so thankful tonight that our God loves the whole world

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:30.799
Amen for God so loved the world praise the Lord for that

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.719
His love is global it's to all people

00:11:36.359 --> 00:11:40.279
But his love is personal. He loves us as individuals

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:45.879
He's concerned about you and he's concerned about me as individuals and we find that as those

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.999
Disciples were there, by the way

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:54.359
So often as you read the Gospels you can read how the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of great multitudes of people

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:59.159
He singles out individuals and he ministers to individuals

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:04.679
There was a great host in a certain leper and we see that repeatedly how Jesus

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:11.279
ministers to individuals and we find that he said unto them he said unto them, but then he says

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:14.279
Simon son of Jonas

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:16.759
Simon son of Jonas

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.279
Lovest thou me

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:26.119
More than these we find that Jesus saith to Simon Peter according to verse number 15

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:32.199
According to verse number 16 Jesus saith to Peter again and according to verse number 17

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:35.519
He Jesus saith to him Peter the third time

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:42.079
Our God is a personal God in this interaction that we read here is a personal interaction

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:46.679
and I'm thankful this evening that though as we look at the letter to the Church of

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:52.319
Ephesus in Revelation chapter 2 and we begin reading those letters to the seven churches that yes

00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:56.999
God is addressing the church at Ephesus the Church of Ephesus

00:12:56.999 --> 00:13:01.599
but remember a church is made up of individual believers and

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:08.839
So when God is saying to the Church of Ephesus that you've left your first love he's speaking about

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:15.039
Individual believers within the congregation that had left their first love

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:23.439
And when you receive that letter of correction when you receive that word that Christ gave to the church

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:30.479
It requires a time of pause and examination and being able to evaluate our lives and determine

00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:36.399
Have I personally left my first love and I'm thankful here as we have this account in John 21

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:39.159
That Jesus came to Peter personally

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:45.159
And we must understand tonight that you are an individual that God loves

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:53.199
That he desires to have fellowship with you you say me yes, he loves you

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.519
He wants to have fellowship with you

00:13:55.519 --> 00:14:01.359
He desires that you would be in his presence that you would long to have he's not gonna force you

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:05.719
He's not gonna make you but as his child he wants you to have that fellowship

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:08.039
Draw and die unto God

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.719
Amen

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:12.759
We have a privilege to do that to enter into his presence

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:17.919
To come boldly into the throne of grace to understand that he loves us as individuals

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.399
so often

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:27.079
We speak about the need for revival in our nation and we do we need revival, but you know how revival starts

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:29.679
starts with an individual

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:38.519
Revival starts with if you read and you study of of great movements of God of revivals of old you find

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.319
regularly and

00:14:40.319 --> 00:14:44.679
consistently as you study the revivals of old how they started with just a an

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:51.079
Individual a couple of folks that gathered together that desired for God to use them into work

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:53.639
Why because our God is a personal God

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.399
You know, there's a lot of world

00:14:57.599 --> 00:15:04.199
Religions that don't have the truth that we have with regard to the fact that our God is a personal God

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.839
I'm thankful that I can commune with him

00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:13.079
That I can know him Paul says that I may know him and that awesome

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:17.839
He's a personal God the interaction here in John chapter 21, though

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:21.719
There were others that were gathered. It wasn't only Peter that went fishing

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:28.359
There were others that were there and we find that Jesus was personal the interaction was personal number two tonight

00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:34.439
Not only was the interaction personal, but I want you to see the interaction was purposed. Can I tell you this evening?

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:37.159
that our God always

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:38.759
always

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:40.599
moves with purpose

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:45.639
There is a purpose to everything our God does we may not know it at the time

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:49.599
We may not understand it maybe for this lifetime

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:55.639
But we can rest assured in knowing that God has a purpose

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:02.559
And we find that as we rest in that truth that God has a purpose we find in this interaction this evening

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:08.879
This interaction that was personal was also purpose that Jesus was moving with purpose

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:15.399
And we find that he comes to Simon and notice with me at least a first aspect of this purposed

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:21.839
Interaction that Christ had with Peter one of the purposes was that of examination

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:27.479
Notice what he says in verse number 15 Simon son of Jonas

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.159
Lovest thou me

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:32.159
more than these

00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:39.559
Now there's a couple of different ideas that people have had through the centuries of what did Christ mean when he said more than these?

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:41.679
And there are some that have the idea

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.959
Do you love me more than the other?

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:49.599
Disciples than these others that are here and remember as I quoted earlier from Matthew 26 in verse 33

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:56.839
When he said this that that all men shall be offended because of thee though all men shall be offended because of thee yet

00:16:56.839 --> 00:16:58.839
will I never be offended and

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:03.639
Certainly, it could be that Jesus was asking the question

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:07.599
Love is now me more than these speaking of the other disciples

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:15.319
We find also that it's possible. Remember a few verses back that when Peter got there that he was pulling those

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:23.159
Dragging the net according to the end of verse number eight and it tells us as soon verse number nine as they came

00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:29.439
To land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread and it says in verse number 11

00:17:29.439 --> 00:17:32.999
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:40.079
150 and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken now, I don't know

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:42.679
of the

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:49.239
153 here that's mentioned. There's no other place that God tells us a number of fish that they caught

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:51.479
We find that yes

00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:54.599
He says they caught nothing so we could say zero in verse number three

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:59.879
But as far as actually numbering the the number of fish that they caught here 153

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:05.319
I believe there's something significant about that and I believe that as that idea that I go a

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:12.159
Fishing in verse number three remember he was a fisherman and that was the dad's business and that was kind of going back to that

00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:14.839
Jesus said follow me and I'll make you fishers of men

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:20.359
And so we find that when he says love is now me more than these certainly it could be the other disciples that were there

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:23.399
But also maybe the things of the world the fish

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:26.639
Do you love me more than these?

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:29.039
See here's the reality

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:34.279
There are things in this world that are pulling for your love for your affection

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.559
Why does God say John says in first John to love not the world?

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:45.919
Neither the things that are in the world, right? We sing the song rarely

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:52.659
We play it more for an invitation turn your eyes upon Jesus and the things of this world will grow

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:55.000
strangely dim

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.699
But we find that there are many listen we see I mentioned last week

00:19:00.199 --> 00:19:06.939
We'll study it next Sunday morning be part of the message where the Bible tells us of Demas that hath forsaken me having

00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:09.839
Loved this present world

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.839
We find this evening

00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:20.219
That this interaction was purposed and one of the purposes must have been for examination

00:19:20.899 --> 00:19:22.899
For Peter to examine his own heart

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:29.299
Can I tell you this evening that this self-examination that we read of that Peter would have to go through that?

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:34.039
I believe tonight the Church of Ephesus when they receive that letter of correction

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:41.279
They would have had to pause and examine this truth where Jesus God and flesh the one that cannot lie

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:46.979
He's the resurrected Savior at that point. He says you've left your first love

00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:53.259
You can't argue with God, I mean you could try but you lose every time

00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:59.699
Remember what Gamaliel said when they wanted to fight against the disciples. Hey, listen if this thing be a

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.839
of men, it's just going to kind of fizzle out, but if it be of God, then you're really

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:12.419
wasting your time because you're going to fight against God. Tonight, just as the church

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:18.459
of Ephesus when they received that letter and just as Peter here in John 21, I would

00:20:18.459 --> 00:20:24.219
say for us this evening it's a process of examination. The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians

00:20:24.219 --> 00:20:31.539
11 we observe the Lord's Supper, but let a man examine himself. Can I tell you this evening,

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:40.539
it's a difficult process. I look at Peter here and Jesus says, Peter, do you love me?

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:46.379
In verse 15, lovest thou me more than these, and he saith unto him, yea, Lord, thou knowest

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:51.619
that I love thee. He saith unto him, feed my lambs, but then he asks again in verse

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:57.259
16 and then a third time in verse 17. That process of examination, you know your heart

00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:02.259
is deceitful and so is mine. According to Jeremiah 17, our hearts are deceitful, they're

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:09.859
desperately wicked. The process of examination, the process of self-examination is a difficult

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:16.059
process but it is absolutely necessary for every child of God to get alone with God and

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:20.619
to go through that process of self-examination and before we ever say as the psalmist did

00:21:20.619 --> 00:21:28.179
in Psalm 139, search me O God, we must first examine our own hearts and our own lives.

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:33.339
No doubt in my mind, listen again as I mentioned by way of introduction, if the church, if

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:38.699
the believers in the first century of the church of Ephesus were guilty of leaving their

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:44.359
first love, I do not for one moment of time think that every other generation of believers

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:51.519
have been innocent of that particular thing. I think there are many that have been guilty

00:21:51.519 --> 00:22:00.199
of leaving their first love. So I believe tonight that one purpose that the Lord had

00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:05.319
for this interaction, again he always moves with purpose, when Peter says, I go fishing,

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:12.119
God knew where he was. Aren't you thankful God knows where you are? Listen, you can have,

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:18.519
the devil is relentless. Not one of us tonight are immune from his attack, not one of us

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:24.839
tonight are going to go through life without having the accuser of the brethren try to

00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:29.919
trip us and discourage us and defeat us but greater is he that is in me than he that is

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:36.639
in the world. But I want you to know that there are some times in life that we get overloaded,

00:22:36.639 --> 00:22:42.519
we can get bogged down and we can say, as Peter said, I'm going fishing. But Jesus knows

00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:51.799
where you are. He knows where you are and he loves you and he pursues you as a personal

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:58.419
God, as an individual and then he has purpose. He wants us to examine ourselves. Not only

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:03.439
the purpose of examination but I believe in a very real sense there's a purpose here

00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:11.679
of restoration. I'm thankful that our God is a restoring God. I'm thankful tonight that

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:17.719
our God is a God of second and third and you fill in the blank number of chances. Aren't

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:23.419
you thankful for that? Again on Sunday morning we'll deal not only with Demas but you think

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:29.799
about Mark and he says, send them to me. Why? For he's profitable to me for the ministry.

00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:36.999
Ah, what a great statement, what a great truth. And here we find that our God is a restoring

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:44.519
God. He restoreth my soul is what the psalmist says in Psalm 23. We find that this truth

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:52.179
of restoration, see Peter had denied the Lord three times but now he publicly confesses

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:59.039
his love for the Lord three times. I know that there's much debate and there's much

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:04.559
depth with regard to digging into the use of the words and so on and so forth and the

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:08.839
Greek word for love and there are multiple of them and so on and so forth but the reality

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:16.359
is that Jesus was purposed to ask him the question three times and to be able to have

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:23.279
Peter who had denied the Lord thrice to now publicly confess his love for Christ on three

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:27.999
occasions. Back in Matthew 26 I've referenced verse 33 a couple of times but I want you

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:35.719
to look at a few other verses in Matthew 26 beginning in verse 31. We'll look at more

00:24:35.719 --> 00:24:41.439
of the interaction that Jesus had with Peter before he made that quoted statement that

00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:49.839
I made earlier. But notice in verse 31 of Matthew chapter 26 the Bible says this, then

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:54.679
saith Jesus unto them, all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written

00:24:54.679 --> 00:24:59.159
I will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But

00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:04.479
after I am risen again, by the way aren't you thankful that we serve a risen savior?

00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:09.319
He says but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee. Peter answered

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:12.679
and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:18.399
be offended. Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock

00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:24.759
crow thou shalt deny me thrice. Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:32.959
will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. I think Peter believed what

00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:41.479
he said. I don't think Peter thought he would actually deny the Lord. But as you look through

00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:46.079
the chapter and I mentioned it earlier tonight but look at verse 69 the Bible says now Peter

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:52.279
sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with Jesus

00:25:52.279 --> 00:26:00.239
of Galilee. Verse 70 is the first of the three denials. But he denied before them all saying

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:06.399
I know not what thou sayest. When he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:12.039
said unto them that were there this fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth. And again

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:19.759
the second denial in verse 72 he denied with an oath I do not know the man. After a while

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:24.479
came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter surely thou also art one of them

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:32.039
for thy speech bereath thee. Then verse 74 is the third denial he began then began he

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:40.279
to curse and to swear saying I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. Peter

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:45.439
remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me

00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:53.439
thrice and he went out and he wept bitterly. I can't imagine all that Peter experienced

00:26:53.439 --> 00:27:01.919
in this few moments of time. I can't imagine the emotions and all that had transpired the

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:07.879
fear that he had because of what was taking place the uncertainty and all of the different

00:27:07.879 --> 00:27:13.519
emotions that we could mention this evening. But we know that that his heart was broken

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:20.719
in verse number 75. And we find that we have a gracious God that that when we think listen

00:27:20.719 --> 00:27:25.079
there are times in which we could look at our lives and say man I really messed up I

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:32.519
really wouldn't listen. Our God is a God of restoration. He's a restoring God. And Jesus

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:41.359
comes to Peter. He says Peter do you love me? Three times. And I think it's significant

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:47.319
as we look at the not only personal interaction but the purposed interaction that it was for

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:54.439
a process of examination but also for a time of restoration. I think tonight that as I

00:27:54.439 --> 00:28:01.759
look at Peter in John chapter 21 it must have been so encouraging for the Lord to have this

00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:08.039
conversation with him. Yes it was difficult. He says he was grieved in verse 17. But I

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:13.399
believe that later on in life when Peter would look back at this moment at this event it

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:20.759
probably brought him great peace and joy to understand that Jesus met with him there on

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:30.159
the shore of Galilee and had this interaction with him. This evening not only was it personal

00:28:30.199 --> 00:28:36.399
and purposed but number three the interaction was productive. It was productive. Can I tell

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:42.039
you this evening that when we look at God's word and we think about the truth of God's

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:47.719
word and how it effectually worketh in us that believe and understanding this evening

00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:54.039
the power of God's word and we look at this interaction and we find that it produced something.

00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:59.799
We think about the word of God being profitable and we think about the truth of how God's

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:04.639
word will work in the hearts of his people and remember even as we looked a couple of

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:09.799
weeks ago at Revelation chapter 2 as that truth is given to the believers there at the

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:13.879
church of Ephesus when he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou

00:29:13.879 --> 00:29:17.999
hast left thy first love. So what does he do? He gives them counsel. He says remember

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:23.279
therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent. He gives them the corrective measure

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:28.239
and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick

00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:37.599
out of his place except thou repent and so they had a choice to make. This evening when

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:44.159
we look at this interaction that Peter had with Jesus it was productive because of the

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:53.199
way that Peter responded to the interaction. See we can go through the motions. We can

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:59.239
take the step of saying well I went and got some counsel but even as brother McKinney

00:29:59.239 --> 00:29:59.759
said this.

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:07.839
this morning, getting counsel isn't the same as taking heed to counsel, to doing,

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:11.239
to applying the truth of God's Word.

00:30:11.239 --> 00:30:14.639
So I believe in this passage of Scripture, the reason that I would say that it was a

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:20.759
productive interaction is because Peter learned the importance of loving his Savior.

00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:27.679
He learned just how important it was that he loved Jesus with all of his heart.

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:32.159
We learned this evening as we examined the passage of Scripture that it's really your

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.999
heart that God wants.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:36.119
He wants your heart.

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:41.479
And I believe tonight, even as I said two weeks ago, if God truly has our heart, He

00:30:41.479 --> 00:30:44.239
really has all of us.

00:30:44.239 --> 00:30:49.239
When God has our heart, when He's Lord and He's Savior and He's King of your life and

00:30:49.239 --> 00:30:55.719
He's King of my life and He has my heart, then we can sing the songs that we sing and

00:30:55.759 --> 00:31:01.999
we can sing them with great truth and transparency, I'll go where you want me to go, I'll do what

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:02.999
you want me to do.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:03.999
Why?

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:09.799
Because He has my heart and I'll do whatever He wants me to do.

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:20.359
I mentioned several weeks ago about an interview that a fellow on the Christian radio station

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:26.919
was having and I just caught just a few moments of this interaction and the man, Alex McFarland,

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:27.919
is very well known.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.679
He preaches all over the country and I don't know all of his positions.

00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:33.959
I don't endorse him wholly just because I mentioned his name.

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:38.439
But I do say this, that I've heard him say some good things and one thing that he said

00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:43.919
in that interview is he said, I found myself as a new believer just praising God and rejoicing

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:47.039
that I could clean the bathrooms at my church.

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.239
Why?

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:55.599
Because he just loved Jesus and he was willing to do whatever because God had his heart.

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:57.619
You know why God had his heart?

00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:04.119
Because he understood that he was without Christ and then he got saved.

00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:07.839
We mentioned that a little bit in Sunday School this morning as Brother McKinney took us over

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:09.199
to Ephesians chapter number 2.

00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:13.959
Listen, there was a time that we were without Christ, but aren't you thankful that now,

00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:20.359
Oh, hallelujah, for his great mercy and his great love.

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:26.359
We find this evening that Peter learned the truth and the importance of loving his Savior

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:31.039
and he understood how much his Savior loved him and he wants to love him with all his

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:32.039
heart.

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:35.559
Not only did Peter understand the importance of loving Christ, but I believe that Peter

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:38.439
understood what the Lord expected of him.

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:42.999
Notice in verse 15, he says, feed my lambs and verse number 16 and 17, he says, feed

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:43.999
my sheep.

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:48.559
And then we find in verse 19, he says, follow me.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.559
Follow me.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:56.319
Listen, if we understand this evening the importance and we truly love God with all

00:32:56.319 --> 00:33:01.599
of our hearts, we'll do what he calls us to do, we'll live for him, we'll serve him, we'll

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:05.599
keep his commandments and his commandments will not be grievous.

00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:06.859
Why?

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.919
Because he has my heart.

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:14.599
You know, I love my wife and I love my children.

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:20.479
You know, when Holly asks me to help her with something, I'm delighted to be able to do

00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:21.479
it.

00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:22.479
Why?

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:23.479
Because I love her.

00:33:23.479 --> 00:33:25.359
Because I love her.

00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:29.359
I don't like, how many of you like painting?

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:30.359
Some of you.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:31.359
You're crazy.

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.199
I don't like painting.

00:33:33.199 --> 00:33:34.199
I don't.

00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:37.359
But you know what I did a couple of weeks ago?

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:38.719
I did some painting.

00:33:38.719 --> 00:33:39.719
Why?

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:41.519
Because Holly wanted to do some painting.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.159
I did some painting.

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:44.159
You know what?

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:47.399
It was enjoyable, actually.

00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:51.159
And it's one of those things, listen, when I get to serve God, when I love him and I'm

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:54.039
doing it out of love, it's not that I have to do these things.

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:56.839
It's not that, oh, no.

00:33:56.839 --> 00:33:59.079
I delight in doing it.

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.079
Why?

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.759
Because I love him.

00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:05.559
And I know that I love him because he first loved me.

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:10.719
But what happens sometimes is we start getting things out of order, and we start doing as

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:14.599
the church of Ephesus was doing, and we're doing all these things, but we're not doing

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:19.999
it from a heart of love, the motive.

00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:27.079
And the reality this evening is that Peter learned that Jesus was to be loved with all

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:33.639
of his heart, and that he had to do the will of God in his life to minister to those that

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:41.239
God would call him to minister to, to follow Jesus wherever Jesus would lead him to go.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:44.599
You know, tonight, if we love Jesus the way that we should, then we, too, would be in

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:45.599
the same position.

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.599
Lord, I'll do what you want me to do.

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:50.279
I'll go where you want me to go because I love you.

00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:55.919
Go over to the book of Isaiah, if you will, Isaiah chapter 1.

00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:01.359
Give you a few thoughts tonight from Isaiah and Jeremiah very quickly.

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:05.519
There's a problem in the day of Hosea, in chapter 10 of Hosea, the Bible says they had

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:06.519
a divided heart.

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:09.159
You know, we've got to be careful.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.199
We can't have a divided heart.

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:11.679
We can't serve God and mammon.

00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:14.239
That's what Jesus said.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:21.039
Isaiah chapter number 1, we find that verse number 11, notice what the Bible says in Isaiah

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:25.879
1 and 11, to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me, saith the Lord?

00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:31.159
I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of red fed beasts, and I delight

00:35:31.159 --> 00:35:34.279
not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats.

00:35:34.279 --> 00:35:39.719
When you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?

00:35:39.719 --> 00:35:45.119
Bring no more, notice what it says, vain oblations, incenses and abomination unto me, the new

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:49.159
moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies I cannot away with.

00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:53.919
It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting, your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:54.999
hateth.

00:35:54.999 --> 00:35:58.299
They are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them.

00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:02.879
And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, yea, when you make

00:36:02.879 --> 00:36:04.759
many prayers, I will not hear.

00:36:04.759 --> 00:36:10.079
Your hands are full of blood, wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:14.199
from before mine eyes, cease to do evil.

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:17.959
Understand that as we look at this passage of scripture, that they were bringing offerings,

00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:19.959
they were, where did they get the idea of bringing offerings?

00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:22.959
Well, they were doing what God had commanded them to do back in Leviticus.

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:26.279
But you know what was missing?

00:36:26.279 --> 00:36:27.279
Their heart.

00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:28.279
Their heart.

00:36:28.279 --> 00:36:32.759
God says, why are you bringing me these things?

00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:38.559
Notice in Isaiah chapter 29 and verse 13, notice what the Bible says, and I don't have

00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:43.719
time to develop all of that from Isaiah 1, but notice in Isaiah 29 and verse 13, a verse

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:47.999
that would be quoted later in the Gospels, the Bible says this in verse 13, wherefore

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:54.799
the Lord said, forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips

00:36:54.799 --> 00:37:02.279
do honor me, but notice, but have removed their heart far from me.

00:37:02.279 --> 00:37:06.839
And their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:11.539
God says with their mouth, they draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips they

00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:12.539
do honor me.

00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:18.179
But there's a problem because their heart, their heart has been removed.

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:23.059
In Jeremiah chapter 4 and verse number 4, notice what the prophet says with regard to

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:27.139
the subject of our heart tonight.

00:37:27.139 --> 00:37:29.219
In verse number 3, I'll read with it.

00:37:29.219 --> 00:37:33.939
In Jeremiah chapter 4 and verse number 3, it says, for thus saith the Lord to the men

00:37:33.939 --> 00:37:39.459
of Judah and Jerusalem, break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns, circumcise

00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:41.619
yourselves to the Lord.

00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:48.539
Notice what he says, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:55.059
of Jerusalem, lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because

00:37:55.059 --> 00:37:57.259
of the evil of your doings.

00:37:57.259 --> 00:38:03.379
Again in chapter 29, Jeremiah 29 and verse 13, the Bible says this with regard to this

00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:10.019
truth with regard to our hearts.

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:14.299
In Jeremiah 29 and verse 13, you shall seek me and find me, notice when you shall search

00:38:14.299 --> 00:38:19.219
for me with what, all your heart.

00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:27.619
You know, God doesn't want half-hearted Christianity, He doesn't want us to have a divided heart.

00:38:27.619 --> 00:38:30.459
He wants us to have a heart for Him.

00:38:30.459 --> 00:38:34.499
He wants us to love Him with all of our heart.

00:38:34.499 --> 00:38:39.619
This evening as I consider the thought from Revelation chapter 2, I just couldn't get

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:42.399
away from it.

00:38:42.399 --> 00:38:49.699
Because I believe tonight that every single one of us, let him that thinketh he stand

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:55.119
take heed lest he fall, that's Bible, right, that's what it says.

00:38:55.119 --> 00:39:00.859
Every one of us tonight have an enemy.

00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:07.719
And I hope tonight that we could each stand and say, I love God with all my heart.

00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:13.239
But I understand just as Peter stood and said, Lord, I'll never deny you, that we have an

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:17.639
enemy and he's relentless and he's ruthless.

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:22.279
And he wants to, he wants to divide your heart and my heart.

00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:27.639
He wants to cause us to just go through the motions and just kind of half-hearted, just

00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:34.759
kind of do what we know we're supposed to do without the heart.

00:39:34.799 --> 00:39:36.999
But God says, I want your heart.

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:40.399
I want your heart.

00:39:40.399 --> 00:39:47.699
Tonight, just as the church of Ephesus and just as Peter needed to have this personal

00:39:47.699 --> 00:39:58.279
interaction that would cause some examination, say, Lord, I don't want to be guilty of leaving

00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:59.199
my first love.

00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:05.219
Lord, I want to keep my heart where it ought to be.

00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:09.879
Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

00:40:09.879 --> 00:40:14.539
Guard my heart, keep it.

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:24.659
Be aware of the external attacks so that we could not be guilty, as those believers in

00:40:24.659 --> 00:40:28.619
the first century were, of leaving their first love.

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:31.819
It's personal, it's individual.

00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:34.099
What does God have for each of us?

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:38.259
If you say tonight, I love God with all my heart, I say praise the Lord.

00:40:38.259 --> 00:40:43.339
But can I tell you tonight, protect it.

00:40:43.339 --> 00:40:45.139
Protect it.

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:46.139
Be careful.

00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:48.499
You have an enemy.

00:40:48.499 --> 00:40:50.739
We need to keep on loving God with all of our heart.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:51.739
Let's pray.

00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:53.059
Father, we love you.

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:55.859
We thank you for loving us.

00:40:55.859 --> 00:40:59.819
We know that we only love you because you first loved us.

00:40:59.819 --> 00:41:10.419
God, I think about this correction to the church of Ephesus and coupled with this interaction

00:41:10.419 --> 00:41:15.179
that our resurrected Savior had with Peter.

00:41:15.179 --> 00:41:21.299
God, it brings me to a place of self-examination.

00:41:21.299 --> 00:41:31.739
I pray tonight that it would help all of us, Lord, to pause and truly examine our hearts.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:34.539
That we'd love you like we should.

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:37.179
We'd love you with all of our hearts.

00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:41.259
I pray that as we have this moment of invitation, I pray, God, that you'd have your will in

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:44.419
a way, move and work as only you can, and we'll thank you for it.

00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:45.539
In Christ's name we pray.
