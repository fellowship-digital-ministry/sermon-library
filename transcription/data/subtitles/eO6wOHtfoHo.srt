1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
you through the book of Colossians, and I have thoroughly enjoyed already these several

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,000
messages that I've been able to prepare and deliver from this great book, and it's only

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,539
four chapters in the book of Colossians, and some have asked, is it really going to take

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,539
us all year?

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,700
Well, that kind of depends, and this is message number five, and we'll get through almost

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,139
the end of chapter number one today, and I have another message next week on chapter

7
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:28,940
number one, but we'll continue to make progress through this book, and you'll recall last

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,740
week as we looked at verses nine through 14 that we dealt with the truth with regard

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,099
to the prayer of Paul for the believers in Colossians.

10
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:44,419
What a blessing it was to kind of dig through those verses of scripture and to see exactly

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:50,740
how it was that Paul was praying for them, and we think about the ministry of intercessory

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,459
prayer, the great privilege that we have to go to God on the behalf of others, and what

13
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,459
a blessing.

14
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:03,139
As we continue to study through this book, you'll remember that as we dealt with the

15
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:09,019
prayer of Paul in verses nine through 14, we kind of said some things with regard to

16
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,620
the prayer, and one of the things that we said is we need to know some things about

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,260
people in order to pray for them, to engage in this ministry of intercessory prayer, and

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,360
some of what the apostle Paul knew was the fact that there were false teachers that were

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,839
present there in Colossae, and knowing that those false teachers were present, of course

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:35,160
he prayed that they would be spiritually mature, that they would grow in their walk with Christ,

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,760
and I often said, and I have often said over the years, and I said it last week as well,

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,120
that one of the best ways to combat false teaching is spiritual maturity, spiritual

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
growth.

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,720
When you know the Word of God and you know the truth of God's Word, it enables you to

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,959
be able to stand against the attacks of the enemy, it enables you to be able to stand

26
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,000
against the subtlety of the false teachers.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,480
I know that I've said many times that they will use our vocabulary, but they use a different

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,080
definition, and so you've got to be careful with these false teachers.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,880
They're very sly and cunning, and the subtlety that you find within false teachers, and so

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,639
the apostle Paul understood that those false teachers were present, and that gives us some

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,520
understanding as to the next several verses that are before us this morning, and really

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,919
this passage of Scripture, Colossians 1, we'll be looking at verses 15 through 23, is one

33
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:38,039
of the most powerful passages in briefly describing the person of Jesus Christ, and I don't really

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,360
think you could probably go anywhere else in the New Testament and find just a handful

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,839
of verses that so powerfully gives us truth with regard to the person of Jesus Christ.

36
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:54,240
Obviously, you can compare Scripture with Scripture, you can go to a whole host of passages,

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,000
but in these few verses we find that Paul is going to provide this great truth, powerful

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,660
truth, and as these false teachers were present and active in the city of Colossae, one thing

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,059
that we'd understand about false teachers is they all have one thing in common.

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,179
One thing that I believe that all false teachers have in common is their attack upon the person

41
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,160
of Jesus Christ.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,380
And false teachers will always have… there are all sorts of things, you can look at false

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,619
teachers and you can find all sorts of various teachings and various creeds and religious

44
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:34,279
activities, if you will, that they would encourage you to be participating in, but one thing

45
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:39,440
that is common amongst false teachers is their attack upon the person of Jesus Christ.

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,240
We can ask ourselves this morning, why is that?

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,399
Why is there unity amongst the false teachers on this one point of an attack upon the person

48
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,520
of Jesus Christ?

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Well, if the enemy is able to cause people to err regarding the person and work of Jesus

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,759
Christ, we understand that the consequences are grave and eternal.

51
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,320
And so therefore, there's this unity, if you will, amongst these false teachers on

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,440
the attack against the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Usually false teachers will not deny the existence of Jesus Christ.

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,320
They won't try to come in and say, no, Jesus doesn't exist, and he's just… no, no, they'll

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,239
just not give the fullness of who Jesus really is.

56
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:30,559
They're okay, false teachers are okay with someone believing that Jesus existed, they're

57
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:35,399
okay with somebody saying that he was a good man, that he was even a prophet, but they're

58
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,399
not okay with saying that he is the Son of God and the only Savior for mankind, and that

59
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,279
of course is what we find the Word of God to clearly teach us.

60
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,779
And so therefore, this attack upon who he is.

61
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,720
If you'll remember on Wednesday evening, several weeks ago, we began studying about the doctrine

62
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,160
of Christ, and one of the passages in which we started with was there in Matthew when

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,079
the Lord Jesus Christ said to the disciples, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

64
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,920
And of course, the disciples provided an answer, and in that answer, what was revealed not

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,119
only to the Lord, of course he already knew it, but their acknowledgment would also reveal

66
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:22,739
to them, and it reveals to us, that there was confusion with regard to who Jesus is.

67
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,119
Some say that you're John the Baptist, some say that you're one of the prophets, Elijah

68
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:33,119
or Jeremiah or one of the others, and there was confusion about who Jesus is, and we find

69
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,720
that still today, that confusion exists.

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,200
And of course, Jesus then turns the attention to his disciples and he says, but whom say

71
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,579
ye that I am?

72
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:49,799
And Peter stood with great confidence and boldness and he said, thou art the Christ,

73
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,399
the Son of the living God.

74
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,959
What a great declaration, a powerful truth that was revealed there in the Gospel of Matthew,

75
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,399
and we find that here in Colossae, the Greek philosophers and the Gnostics, they really

76
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,959
didn't believe, they didn't really mind if people believed in Jesus.

77
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,079
I mean, think about the timing.

78
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:15,640
This is being written nearly 25 to 35 years after the crucifixion and resurrection of

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,000
Jesus Christ.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,519
No doubt there were people that knew that Jesus existed.

81
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,760
They didn't mind if you believed that Jesus existed, as long as you did not believe that

82
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,000
he was God in flesh and the Savior of the world.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,239
Therefore, Paul declares powerfully and concisely who Christ is.

84
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:41,839
It is important for us to note that as we look at this passage of Scripture, that Paul

85
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,160
actually did not go forth and attack the false teaching.

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,640
You know what he did?

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,959
He just exalted the Lord Jesus Christ, and he showed who Jesus is.

88
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,160
See, one of the things, I took some classes in seminary Bible college that deal with all

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,079
of the coltonisms and what have you, and they try to prepare you on how to talk to people

90
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,519
with different perspectives and what have you, and you know what I've learned in life?

91
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,239
I've learned, not to say that the classes were of no value, but what I've learned in

92
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,880
life is that if we would simply just exalt the Lord Jesus Christ, I don't need to answer

93
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,720
all of the questions of the false teachers, I don't need to deal with all of those things,

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,320
I simply need to elevate and exalt our Savior.

95
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,519
Now, knowing some of those things may help us, but I've found in life that often, as

96
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:38,119
we would deal with some of those particular aspects of maybe a cult or a false teacher,

97
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:42,799
we can find ourselves winning an argument, or engaged in an argument, but never actually

98
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:49,140
able to present who Jesus is in a fashion in which they might come to a saving knowledge

99
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,079
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

100
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,079
Why?

101
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,880
Because we just want to argue about the points of what their religion teaches versus what

102
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,880
the Bible teaches, and we just begin to get in an argument, and you'll find very few people

103
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,839
are willing to acknowledge that they're wrong.

104
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
So we just exalt Christ, and we just elevate Christ.

105
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,720
If you're taking notes this morning, that's what I've titled the message, The Exalted

106
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Christ.

107
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
The Exalted Christ.

108
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,959
In this passage of Scripture, I want you to notice, if you're taking notes, number one,

109
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,799
the way that Christ is described.

110
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:21,720
Notice with me in verse number 12, really, we'll kind of start there.

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,220
I know that the passage will deal with primarily verses 15 through 23, but let's go back to

112
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,220
verse number 12.

113
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,719
The Bible says this, giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet, to be partakers

114
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,840
of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,

115
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,359
and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through

116
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,979
his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

117
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,940
Who is, and so the reason why I start it there back in verse number 12 is because you do

118
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,080
begin in verse number 15, and it says, who is the image of the invisible God.

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,840
We understand that he's referring back to his dear Son that is mentioned at the end

120
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,460
of verse number 13, and it's carried through, he's referring to the Lord Jesus Christ.

121
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,479
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature, for by him were

122
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:16,359
all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible,

123
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:22,599
whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by him

124
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,559
and for him.

125
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,059
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

126
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,419
And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from

127
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:40,340
the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence, for it pleased the Father

128
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,500
that in him should all fullness dwell.

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,460
And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him, to reconcile all things

130
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,979
unto himself, by him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, and you,

131
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:00,219
that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind.

132
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:05,699
by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled

133
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,819
the body of His flesh through death

134
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,499
to present you holy and unblameable

135
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,819
and unreprovable in His sight.

136
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,579
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled,

137
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,539
and be not moved away from the hope

138
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:19,939
of the Gospel which ye have heard,

139
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,739
which was preached to every creature

140
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,139
which is under heaven,

141
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,519
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister."

142
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,179
Number one, if you're taking notes,

143
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,919
notice the way Christ is described.

144
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,639
The way that He is described.

145
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,239
Number one, we find right here in v. 15

146
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,439
and really down through a number of verses,

147
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,879
v. 19 in particular,

148
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,239
but the first way in which He is described

149
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,999
is that He is the image of the invisible God.

150
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,319
John 4 and v. 24 when Jesus is meeting

151
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,979
with the woman of the well there

152
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,659
when He says that He must needs go

153
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,979
through Samaria, He's having that conversation.

154
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,879
And in John 4 and v. 24,

155
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,379
the Bible says that God is a Spirit.

156
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,359
They that worship Him must worship Him

157
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,919
in spirit and in truth.

158
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,399
And so we find that Paul,

159
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,599
as he's elevating and exalting the Lord Jesus Christ,

160
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,639
the first manner in which he describes

161
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,939
our wonderful Savior is that He is the image

162
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,279
of the invisible God.

163
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,919
That word image is important.

164
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,759
It means the likeness.

165
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,359
It really means the manifestation.

166
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,239
And it helps us to understand

167
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,639
what the Apostle Paul is saying here.

168
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,799
And it helps us to understand the deity of Christ.

169
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,319
Again, as we compare Scripture with Scripture,

170
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,779
what Paul is saying to these believers in Colossae

171
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,899
is that Jesus is God.

172
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,139
That He is the very God in flesh.

173
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,819
That He is the image of the invisible God.

174
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,179
You understand that at the incarnation,

175
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,979
He did not become God.

176
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,959
He is not like God.

177
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,499
He is God.

178
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,259
And He always has been and forever will be.

179
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,899
He is God.

180
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,679
And we find that the Bible would reveal to us

181
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,399
that Jesus manifested God to people.

182
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,059
See, we mentioned already that John 4 and verse 24,

183
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,399
God is a spirit.

184
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,559
And so we find that as Jesus would manifest the Father,

185
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,719
and He uses that terminology often

186
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,679
in the book of John in particular,

187
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,079
and that word manifest,

188
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,639
it means to make known or visible.

189
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,079
To make known or to make visible.

190
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,359
And so if God is a spirit,

191
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,619
we find that Jesus as God,

192
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:31,499
when He was robed in human flesh at the incarnation,

193
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:33,599
He did not cease to be God.

194
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,279
He continued to be God because He is God.

195
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,819
And He manifested, He made known

196
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,139
or made visible what God is or who God is.

197
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,099
And we find that in John 1,

198
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,679
hold your place here in the book of Colossians.

199
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,619
We'll look at a few verses in the book of John.

200
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,599
And I want you to notice in John 1,

201
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,959
a passage in which we often reference

202
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,179
with regard to the incarnation and what power it is.

203
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,099
We'll look at the first three verses in just a moment,

204
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,979
but I want you to look at verse number 14 with me here

205
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,419
as we speak about the Lord Jesus Christ

206
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,139
being the image of the invisible God.

207
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,659
The Bible says in verse number 14,

208
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,859
and the Word was made flesh.

209
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,339
Now we know in the beginning of this chapter

210
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,939
that the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the Word

211
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,899
and the Word was with God and the Word was God.

212
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,359
And so Jesus is the Word of God.

213
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,719
It's a name that was assigned to Him.

214
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,319
And He, it says this,

215
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,799
the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,

216
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,039
tabernacled among us.

217
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,119
And it says here, and we beheld His glory,

218
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,719
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,

219
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,319
full of grace and truth.

220
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,999
How could they behold His glory?

221
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,079
Because He manifested Himself, right?

222
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,499
He made it visible.

223
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,439
He made it known through the incarnation.

224
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,979
Look at verse number 18.

225
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:55,339
No man hath seen God at any time.

226
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:56,979
The only begotten Son,

227
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,899
which is in the bosom of the Father,

228
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,619
He hath declared Him.

229
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,899
In John chapter number 17,

230
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,479
we find that the Bible makes this truth known to us

231
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,379
with regard to the day in which Jesus,

232
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,059
He says the hour is now come.

233
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,099
He would soon go to the cross of Calvary.

234
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:16,979
And as He's praying here in this passage of Scripture,

235
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,899
many wonderful things are revealed to us here,

236
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,999
but we find that just as Colossians 1

237
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,539
deals with the eternality of Christ,

238
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:29,239
so also John 17 deals with the eternality of Christ.

239
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,679
Just as Colossians 1 deals with the fact

240
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,939
that He is the image,

241
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,359
the manifestation of the invisible God,

242
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,119
so also we find that truth in John 17.

243
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,779
Notice in verse number five,

244
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,319
Jesus says this,

245
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,319
and now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self,

246
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:48,799
notice this,

247
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:51,999
with the glory which I had with Thee

248
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:55,439
before the world was.

249
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,219
The eternality of Christ,

250
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,499
we see that over in the book of Colossians,

251
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,579
stay here in John,

252
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,099
I'm gonna read another couple of verses here,

253
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,899
but in the book of Colossians in chapter number one,

254
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,799
we see the eternality of Christ in verse number 17

255
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,059
when the Bible says He is before all things,

256
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,379
and by Him all things consist.

257
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,839
So in John 17, in verse number five,

258
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,079
we see the eternality,

259
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,599
and then we see the manifestation,

260
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,199
look in verse number six of John 17,

261
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,139
the Bible says this,

262
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:25,979
Jesus said,

263
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:29,319
I have manifested Thy name unto the men

264
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,919
which Thou gavest me out of the world.

265
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,079
Thine they were,

266
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,279
and Thou gavest them me,

267
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,799
and they have kept Thy word.

268
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,479
Again, that word manifest means to make known

269
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,919
or make visible,

270
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,859
and so Jesus, often as He was walking

271
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,759
upon the earth during His earthly ministry,

272
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,279
He made the claim of deity,

273
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,039
and we understand that He made the claim of deity

274
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,999
because often the religious leaders

275
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,319
were ready to stone Him and kill Him

276
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,659
because of the statements,

277
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,719
the declarations that He made,

278
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,999
and so we find not only does the Bible tell us here

279
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,679
in Colossians 1 and 15

280
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,999
that He is the image of the invisible God,

281
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,479
I want you to notice what is said in verse number 19,

282
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,739
we'll read the rest of verse 15 here in just a moment,

283
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,719
but look and skip down to verse number 19.

284
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,199
Notice what it says,

285
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,859
for it pleased the Father.

286
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,079
Now, you understand that as we look here

287
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,439
at this passage of Scripture,

288
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:29,079
and we begin to see the Trinity or the triunity,

289
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,439
and we see that the Bible says

290
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,839
that it pleased the Father,

291
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,559
that in Him, speaking of Jesus Christ,

292
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,239
His Son, as He mentions in verse number 13,

293
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,519
when it talks about the kingdom of His dear Son,

294
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,859
we see that the Bible says that it pleased the Father,

295
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,679
that in Him, notice this phrase,

296
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,059
should all fullness dwell.

297
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:56,059
Now, Paul, again, without attacking the false teachers

298
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,299
and saying here's where they're wrong,

299
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,739
here's where they're wrong,

300
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,559
he's exalting Christ,

301
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,019
but in so doing, he's exposing the false teachers

302
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:09,059
because they had this idea of these angels

303
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,339
and various created beings and so on and so forth

304
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,559
that there would be aspects

305
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,119
in which there would be certain amounts of divinity

306
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,199
and power and so on and so forth,

307
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,479
and here, the Apostle Paul says,

308
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:23,239
in Him, in Jesus Christ,

309
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,959
it pleased the Father that in Him

310
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,739
should all fullness dwell.

311
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,079
The entirety of it.

312
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,999
The whole sum of it.

313
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:38,599
The total of all divine power and attributes

314
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,799
are in Jesus Christ.

315
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,619
All fullness, and then it says dwell.

316
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:46,659
The idea of that word dwell,

317
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,359
not only does it mean to be present,

318
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,839
but it carries with it the idea

319
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,759
of being at home permanently.

320
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,459
In other words, He always has been

321
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,839
and He always will be God.

322
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,279
The truth that we find, again,

323
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,579
this passage of Scripture is exalting the Lord Jesus Christ

324
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,299
and we find the way in which He is described

325
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,599
in John 1, we looked at a few verses,

326
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,539
but in verse number 16,

327
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,259
the Bible in that passage of Scripture

328
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,179
tells us this truth,

329
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,499
and of His fullness have all we received

330
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,179
and grace for grace.

331
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,539
And so Paul is telling these believers in Colossae,

332
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,779
let me help you understand a little bit more

333
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,259
about Jesus Christ.

334
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,299
Let me help you understand who He is

335
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,859
in a very distinct and a very powerful

336
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:36,919
and concise way.

337
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,839
Number one, He is the image of the invisible God.

338
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,879
Number two, He is the Creator.

339
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,199
At the end of verse number 15,

340
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:46,879
the Bible says the firstborn of every creature.

341
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:50,000
Now, we need to be careful as understanding

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,879
what is meant by this phraseology,

343
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,679
the firstborn of every creature.

344
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,279
The false teachers will tell you

345
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,319
that that means Jesus was created.

346
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,479
That's what they'll tell you.

347
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,279
He was the firstborn, so therefore He was created.

348
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,679
Well, that's in violation of Scripture.

349
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,279
Scripture does not support that

350
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,259
when you compare Scripture with Scripture.

351
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,259
Also, we find that that word firstborn

352
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,579
not only carries with it maybe the firstborn

353
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:19,979
as a child, but you think about the distinction

354
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:23,539
in the Old Testament of the heir, the firstborn,

355
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,779
the one that has supremacy,

356
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:29,339
that receives the inheritance, that owns the things,

357
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,339
and you find that here in speaking of Jesus Christ,

358
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,739
when He says that He's the firstborn of every creature,

359
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,039
it does not mean that He was created.

360
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,199
He is the Creator, and that is what we find here,

361
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,519
not only the way that Christ is described,

362
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,279
that He is the image of the invisible God,

363
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,559
but number two, He is the Creator,

364
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,839
and we find that here as we look in verse number 15

365
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,279
down through verse number 17

366
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,000
in understanding the work of creation,

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,079
that the Bible says that He is the firstborn

368
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,079
of every creature, for by Him were all things made.

369
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,879
created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether

370
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:12,479
they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were

371
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:19,719
created by Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and by Him all things

372
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:25,319
consist." Now we'd have to understand and make this note that the truth of John

373
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,839
chapter number one, coupled with the truth of Colossians chapter number one,

374
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:36,519
these passages of Scripture do not contradict the record of Genesis 1.

375
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:43,639
Rather, we would find that these passages of Scripture complement what we find in

376
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:48,159
Genesis chapter number one and provide further details. When you read Genesis

377
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,439
chapter number one, you find very simply where the Bible says, in the beginning

378
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:59,359
God created the heaven and the earth, a passage in which we're familiar with. We

379
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:04,159
find that in John chapter number one and Colossians chapter number one, that God

380
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,519
is going to, through revelation, the divine revelation of the Word of God, He

381
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:16,699
is going to give us further details with regard to the work of Jesus Christ in

382
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:20,999
creation. He's the Creator. And we find that in John chapter number one, the

383
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,439
Bible says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word

384
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,079
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and

385
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,399
without Him was not anything made that was made. It's obvious in

386
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:39,159
John 1, as well as Colossians 1, that he's speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ.

387
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:46,539
And it says, for by Him, in verse number 16, were all things created. I'm thankful

388
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,759
that God gives us the truth of creation. I've made known, especially as we were

389
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,959
studying the book of Genesis, that the truth of creation is not isolated to the

390
00:21:56,959 --> 00:22:02,879
first few chapters of the book of Genesis. The truth of creation is dealt

391
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,919
with throughout the whole of God's Word. You will find various passages of

392
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,279
Scripture throughout the Old and New Testament that declare to us the

393
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,039
creation of the universe, and the fact that our God is the Creator. And here, as

394
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,319
we would think about the truth that is given to us, for by Him were all things

395
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:26,079
created that are in heaven, that are in earth, that we would understand that this

396
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:33,959
truth of creation is not arrived to by reasoning, but rather through revelation.

397
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:41,279
Many have tried to reason. Many have offered various ideas as to how the

398
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,879
cosmos began, and all of those things. And science has offered its theories, no

399
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:50,879
doubt. And we understand that we're living in the midst of a generation that

400
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:55,119
are dealing with a number of false teachers that have denied the Creator

401
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:02,039
God, and they have offered some other theory as to the universe in which

402
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:08,439
we live in, where we came from. But we find that the truth is not arrived to by

403
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:18,039
reasoning, but by revelation. One who was there, God, reveals to us how He did what

404
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:25,359
He did. You could enter into a room, and you could have some observation of

405
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:31,479
something that took place, and as you would look at that particular example

406
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:38,279
that would be before you, you could try to, through using reason, conclude what

407
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,799
was going on, and how things started there. And maybe you're looking at some

408
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,919
sophisticated type of machinery, and you go in, and you begin to evaluate, and you

409
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,199
make all kinds of calculations, and you begin to try to give an explanation

410
00:23:53,199 --> 00:24:00,119
through reason as to how this process started. And then somebody comes in that

411
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,599
was there, that started the process, and says, let me explain to you exactly what

412
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:12,399
happened here. Because through your theory, you're not going to reach the

413
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:17,879
proper conclusion, because it cannot be reached through reasoning. In fact, if you

414
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:22,799
were to go and see a pendulum swinging back and forth, and you could make some

415
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,239
measurements as to the distance in which that pendulum is traveling in each

416
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:33,999
direction, if you were, you know, up to speed with physics and mathematics and

417
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:37,359
all of those types of things, you could work all sorts of calculations, and

418
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,919
through all of your calculations, you may be able to determine when that pendulum

419
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:49,119
will stop swinging. But if you use the same calculations, and you try to go

420
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,159
backwards, and try to find when it started swinging, you're gonna find

421
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,839
yourself in a mess. The reason why is because you would eventually get to the

422
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,359
place that your calculations would really have said that that thing would

423
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,759
have to be spinning all the way around in order for it to still be spinning at

424
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,279
the distance, or still going back and forth in the distance in which it was

425
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,079
currently moving. And so somebody comes in and says, no, actually this is what we

426
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,279
did, this is how we started the process. And so we find that the truth of

427
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,639
creation is a truth that is revealed to us through the Creator, through God.

428
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:28,999
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, not only for

429
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:33,879
doctrine, but we find that Paul says there in 2 Timothy

430
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:37,799
chapter number 3, that it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

431
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,119
for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be perfect, throughly

432
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,199
furnished unto all good works. And so God has given us His Word, He's given us

433
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:51,479
the account of creation. Notice, as we would begin to think about God being the

434
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:56,559
Creator, that He is the one who was there, and He is the one that gives us the

435
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,959
record. He created everything, and He controls everything. The Bible says in

436
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:06,439
verse number 16, notice it says, all things were created by Him. It tells us

437
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:11,799
that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible. I heard a

438
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,279
story, not really a story, it was an account yesterday, I heard an account of

439
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:23,359
someone in some desert over in Africa found the smallest species of some type

440
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,039
of a land animal. And they're going through all this sort of thing, and they

441
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,719
were giving the measurements, and it was microscopic, the size of this thing, and

442
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:36,479
some people had discovered this thing. Listen, God created all things, visible

443
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:41,319
and invisible. The Bible says here this, whether they be thrones or dominions or

444
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,279
principalities or powers. It's interesting, because here in verse

445
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,679
number 16, when He begins to deal with that thrones, dominions, principalities,

446
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,039
and powers, you will see that He's speaking of the angel world. You know,

447
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:59,519
angels are created beings. God created the angels. In the book of Ephesians, in

448
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,079
chapter number 6, as you would begin to deal with the whole armor of God and the

449
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,519
the battle that we're engaged in, you would find that Paul says in Ephesians

450
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,159
6 and verse number 12, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against

451
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,279
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

452
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,559
against spiritual wickedness in high places. See, these false teachers in

453
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,239
Colossae, they were dealing with some things with regard to angels, and they

454
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,759
were dealing with some angel worship. We'll find that later, near the end of

455
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,159
chapter number 2, in particular, where that's dealt with. But you find here, as

456
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,639
Paul is exalting the Lord Jesus Christ, that he says, listen, he created

457
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:47,479
everything, including the angels. Some people would like to think that Jesus is

458
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:53,599
actually lower than an angel in his power and so on and so forth, because he

459
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:59,479
came as a man. But as we studied the book of Hebrews, we understood that he came in

460
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:05,239
that fashion so that he could die and redeem mankind. He had to come in the

461
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:11,679
form of a man. This is God's plan. By the way, I'm so thankful for God's plan. We

462
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,679
find that the Bible continues and says this, all things were created by him and

463
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:25,799
for him. Not only that, he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

464
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,799
Hebrews 1 and verse number 3 gives us truth with regard, again, to this subject

465
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,359
matter of the creation. It tells us in Hebrews 1 and verse number 3, who being

466
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,319
the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person, it sounds

467
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,759
similar to what we're studying in here in Colossians 1, upholding all things by

468
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,639
the word of his power. When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the

469
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:56,799
right hand of the majesty on high. And then it tells us being made so much

470
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,639
better than the angels. And what we find in verse number 3, not only the fact

471
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,639
that it says he's the express image of his person, upholding all things by the

472
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,359
word of his power. Not only did he create all things, but he is the keeper of all

473
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,159
things. If you remove God, the whole universe is gonna fall apart. It really

474
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:22,839
is. Because by him all things consist. He holds it all together. And we find that

475
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,679
here, the believers in Colossians, by preservation for us this morning, when

476
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,519
we're looking at this exalted Christ, we find that he is the image of the

477
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,799
invisible God that he manifested, made known, made visible God to man. We find

478
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,319
that he is the creator. We find, number three, that he is the redeemer. I'm so

479
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,039
thankful that he is the creator. But I'm telling you, the truth that he is the

480
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,759
redeemer causes me to rejoice greatly. Because without his redeeming work, if he

481
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:02,079
was the creator but not the redeemer, we'd all have a destination in Lake

482
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,079
Idaho.

483
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:15,119
a fire. Right? He is the Creator. He is the Redeemer. We looked at those verses of Scripture

484
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,799
last week in verses 12-14. And as we looked at that passage of Scripture last week, we

485
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,399
noted the four powerful statements that were made. And just to quickly review, in verse

486
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,999
number 12, the Bible says that He hath made us meat to be partakers. And what a great

487
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:39,119
word that word meat. It means to make qualified. The reality that we could not qualify ourselves

488
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:47,159
for heaven, but He qualified us. He made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of

489
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,159
the saints in light. You can't qualify yourself and I can't qualify myself for heaven. But

490
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,999
through the imputed righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, He hath made us meat. He hath

491
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:04,559
made us qualified. Isn't that awesome? It says this in verse number 13, that He delivered

492
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:13,439
us from the power of darkness. Hallelujah. Not only that, but He translated us into the

493
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:19,779
kingdom of His dear Son. And then we find in verse number 14, He spoke about the truth

494
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:26,399
of redemption, the forgiveness through His precious blood. And now, once again, the Apostle

495
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:34,119
Paul is going to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ by speaking about His work of redemption.

496
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,239
Notice in verse number 20, and we'll get back to verse number 18 here in just a moment,

497
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:44,599
but notice in verse number 20, the Bible says this, and having made peace through the blood

498
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:52,399
of His cross by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself. By Him, I say, whether they

499
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,559
be things on earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometime alienated and enemies

500
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:06,479
in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled. Now just think here for a moment

501
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:09,659
as we think about these great truths that have already been revealed to us in verse

502
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:16,319
number 20, the peace that we can have with God through the blood of His cross. In Romans

503
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,959
chapter number 5, the Bible speaks about peace with God. Often as the people of God, we speak

504
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:27,519
about the peace of God, and I'm so thankful for the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.

505
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,559
I've often heard people over the years make a statement near the end of their life and

506
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,659
they'll say something like this, if I've asked them if they're sure of heaven, I've made

507
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:42,159
my peace with God. Have you ever heard anyone say that, use that terminology? The question

508
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,919
is this, how did you do that? Because biblically speaking, there's only one way to make peace

509
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:55,399
with God. Romans 5 and verse number 1, therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with

510
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:02,679
God through our Lord Jesus Christ. And here in Colossians 1 and verse number 20, it says,

511
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,599
and having made peace through the blood of His cross, we were at enmity with God. The

512
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,999
Bible says that God, but God commendeth His love toward us and that while we're yet sinners,

513
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:19,839
Christ died for us. We were at enmity with God because of our sin nature, because of

514
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:25,359
the transgression that's recorded in Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve sinned and sin entered

515
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,319
into the world and death passed upon all men for that all have sinned. And we find that

516
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:40,139
we were able now, or we are able to have peace with God through the blood of His cross. Wow.

517
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:45,579
He mentions about the fact that of this truth in verse number 21, when he says in you that

518
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:53,699
were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled.

519
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:59,979
So he speaks about this peace and then he speaks about the truth of reconciliation.

520
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:06,459
I'm so thankful for this word reconciled, the truth of reconciliation. It's through his

521
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:13,139
substitutionary atonement that we can be reconciled to God. You ever had two parties

522
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,619
of people that were at odds at variance one with the other and they need to have a mediator

523
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:23,179
so that they can be reconciled. Well, we were at enmity with God. We were separated from

524
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:29,339
God because He is holy and we are sinful. Jesus Christ, through His work on the cross

525
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:34,419
of Calvary, through the substitutionary atonement, He made it possible that we could be reconciled

526
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:42,339
to God. It's a precious truth of the word of God. And then we see in verse number 22,

527
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:46,819
the Bible continues with this idea about the reconciliation, that it was in the body of

528
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:51,179
His flesh through death. It was through the substitutionary death that we can be reconciled.

529
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:58,499
But notice this last phrase of verse number 22, to present you holy and unblameable and

530
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:05,099
unreprovable in His sight. Now think about that truth. The reality is that there in verse

531
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,939
number 22 when He says to present you, we find in verse number 13 it says, who hath

532
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:16,259
delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of His

533
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:21,619
dear Son. I mentioned the song last Sunday morning. The old account was settled long

534
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,499
ago. I mean, the reality is that the day in which you were saved, you were delivered from

535
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,659
the power of darkness, and you were translated into the kingdom of His dear Son. It was a

536
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:36,339
great miracle that took place on that day. And we find that here the Bible reveals to

537
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:43,259
us that it was so that, or one of the workings of our salvation is that He would present

538
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:51,139
us holy, unblameable, and unreprovable. Now in of ourselves, we're not holy, unblameable,

539
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:57,939
and unreprovable. But in as we're clothed in His righteousness, the imputed righteousness

540
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:03,379
of Christ that we mention in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 21, and we see here that

541
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:09,019
the Bible says that He's done these things, He is the Redeemer, this is the work of redemption,

542
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:14,619
and therefore He is going to present us. Think about this truth of our theme for this year.

543
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:19,579
Complete in Christ. In Colossians 2, in verse number 10, is the verse of Scripture in which

544
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,339
we find that it says, and you are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality

545
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:29,619
and power. I don't need anything else. I'm complete in Christ, and because of the work

546
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:37,219
of redemption, He is going to present you, He's going to present His children holy, unblameable,

547
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:45,819
and unreprovable. Clothed in His holiness. Unblameable and unreprovable are similar words,

548
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:52,059
one meaning without blemish and the other meaning blameless. Now think about that. That's

549
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:56,299
how He's going to present us. Someone said this, every time that God the Father looks

550
00:36:56,299 --> 00:37:02,459
at you, He has the son, S-O-N, in His sight. Because we're clothed in the righteousness

551
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:07,099
of Christ. And you think about the accuser of the brethren, as the book of Revelation

552
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,419
would deal with our enemy being the accuser of the brethren, that He would seek to cause

553
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:16,779
us to, He'd like to bring up our past and talk about our sin, but we're able to say,

554
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:24,339
it's under the blood. Julianna sang that song this morning, I am forgiven forever. Not because

555
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:29,859
I deserved it, but because God who is rich in mercy, because of His great love wherewith

556
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:35,619
He has loved us, because of His work of redemption, He has saved us, He's offered to us the gift

557
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:41,579
of salvation, and as we receive that free gift of eternal life, He makes it so that

558
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:49,299
He is going to present us holy, unblameable, and unreprovable in His sight. It's amazing.

559
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:53,699
Remember the truth that God gave to the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the book of

560
00:37:53,699 --> 00:38:00,379
Psalms, He speaks about the sins being as far removed as the east is from the west.

561
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:05,379
That's in Psalm 103 and verse number 12. And it's a great truth, and you understand that

562
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:12,499
if you travel east, you can just keep on, there's no point in which east and west are

563
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:17,099
really divisible one from the other. We find that He did not say as far as the north is

564
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:22,179
from the south, but as far as the east is from the west. In Psalm 103 and verse 12,

565
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:28,139
as far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.

566
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:34,299
Aren't you thankful for that? We think about redemption. We think about His work of being

567
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:38,899
the Redeemer. Listen, it's a wonderful thing to be forgiven. It's a wonderful thing to

568
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:46,859
know that we have been forgiven by the Lord and that we have this forgiveness. There are

569
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:54,059
many today that do not know that forgiveness is even available. In Micah 7 and verse number

570
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,379
19, it says, He will turn again, He will have compassion upon us, He will subdue our iniquities,

571
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:06,819
and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. We sing a song, gone, gone,

572
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:14,819
gone. Yes, my sins are gone. What a great truth. And here we find one of the impacts

573
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:21,139
or results, if you will, of redemption, that He will present us wholly, unblameable and

574
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:24,739
unreprovable in His sight. We'll deal with it as we get through the rest of Colossians

575
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:29,619
chapter number 1, but let me just give you a quick preview. In verse number 28, and again,

576
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,219
I'm jumping into next week's message, but in verse number 28, the Bible says, Whom we

577
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:38,099
preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every

578
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,339
man perfect in Christ Jesus. Why is Paul preaching the gospel? Why are they out doing these missionary

579
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,779
journeys and going and preaching the gospel? Because he understands the power of the gospel

580
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:54,299
to transform people, but also that we might be presented wholly and unblameable and unreprovable

581
00:39:54,299 --> 00:40:01,419
in His sight, and therefore, Paul is preaching that message. What joy to know that he is

582
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,459
the Redeemer. He's the Redeemer.

583
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:06,999
Number four, how Christ is described.

584
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,039
Notice with me that He is the head

585
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,559
of the body, the church.

586
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,419
In v. 18, the Bible says this,

587
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:18,379
and He is the head of the body, the church.

588
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:19,459
Who is the beginning,

589
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,799
the firstborn from the dead,

590
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,919
that in all things He might have

591
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,099
the preeminence.

592
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,839
As we look at v. 18,

593
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,599
we find that that word head

594
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,919
carries with it the idea of the originator

595
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,839
or the source.

596
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:34,179
It helps us to understand

597
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:36,259
that He is the leader or the ruler,

598
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:40,479
that He is the head of the church.

599
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,019
I'm so thankful that it is His church.

600
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:46,939
You know, the church was not man's idea.

601
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:49,339
It was God's idea.

602
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:50,639
God designed the church.

603
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,979
God empowers the church.

604
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:54,259
The Lord Jesus Christ said in Matthew 16

605
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:55,179
and v. 18,

606
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,759
I will build My church

607
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,299
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

608
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:00,799
We find that Paul tells Timothy

609
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,599
in 1 Timothy 3 and v. 15

610
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,059
that thou oughtest to know how to obey thyself

611
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:06,019
in the house of God,

612
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:08,859
which is the church of the living God.

613
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,559
It's God's church.

614
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,559
He's the head of the church.

615
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,099
Oftentimes, we'll speak about the polity,

616
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,559
if you will, for a local church,

617
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:20,479
and we'll speak about the office of pastor and deacon

618
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,519
and the role in which I play as the pastor.

619
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,399
I am the under-shepherd.

620
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,239
But we have a chief shepherd.

621
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,479
And I'm so thankful that it's His church

622
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:31,479
and that He is the head of the church.

623
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:34,399
What a joy. What a blessing.

624
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:36,739
I want you to think about the ownership

625
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:39,379
that He has of the church just for a moment

626
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,159
and this position that He has

627
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,559
as being the head of the body, the church.

628
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,519
Not only is He the originator, the source,

629
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,919
the leader, and ruler,

630
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,939
but notice what is said in Acts 20.

631
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:54,419
This is just a precious passage of Scripture to me

632
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:56,979
as I study through the entirety of this passage.

633
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:59,479
It's one in which I find great encouragement.

634
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,339
I find that Paul is here speaking to these

635
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,839
Ephesian elders, the leaders of the church at Ephesus,

636
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,799
and he's rehearsing for them

637
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,579
some of his work in ministry,

638
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:12,979
and then he's giving them some good counsel

639
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:14,839
and instruction with regard to the work

640
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,199
that is before them.

641
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,279
And it says this in Acts 20, 28,

642
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:24,519
"'Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves,

643
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,239
into all the flock over which the Holy Ghost

644
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,619
hath made you overseers,

645
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:33,179
to feed the church of God,

646
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:38,039
which He hath purchased with His own blood.'"

647
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,659
Feed the church of God,

648
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:44,119
which He hath purchased with His own blood.

649
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,579
This exalted position of the Lord Jesus Christ

650
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,319
as being the head of the church,

651
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,239
this was important for these believers

652
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,719
in Colossae to understand.

653
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,759
Not only was it important for the believers

654
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,039
in Colossae to understand,

655
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,639
but it's important for us today

656
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,799
to continue to understand that Jesus

657
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:02,719
is the head of the church.

658
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,599
And oh, how powerful that truth is.

659
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
And how mindful we must be

660
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,899
of this reality that is before us.

661
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,019
This is not my church.

662
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:17,939
It's God's church.

663
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:20,499
We understand that He is God in flesh.

664
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:23,179
Paul in these verses of Scripture

665
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:27,339
will present to these believers in Colossae

666
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,619
the Lord Jesus Christ.

667
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,539
The exalted Christ.

668
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:33,059
He will give for them the truth

669
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,559
that He is the image of the invisible God.

670
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,459
That He is the Creator.

671
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:41,199
That He is the Redeemer.

672
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,399
That He is the head of the body, the church.

673
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,179
What is Paul saying?

674
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,139
He's saying that He's God.

675
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,339
That Jesus is God.

676
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,259
Paul in Acts 17,

677
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:56,419
when he arrives in the city of Thessalonica,

678
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:58,219
there was a synagogue of the Jews

679
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,639
and Paul goes to meet with them

680
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,359
and to give them truth.

681
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,899
And the Bible tells us in v. 2 of Acts 17,

682
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:07,579
and Paul, as his manner was,

683
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,439
went in unto them,

684
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,779
and three Sabbath days reasoned with them

685
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,019
out of the Scriptures,

686
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,779
opening and alleging that Christ's most needs

687
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,199
have suffered,

688
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,019
and risen again from the dead,

689
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:23,939
and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you

690
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:26,899
is Christ.

691
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,779
They knew who this Jesus was.

692
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:31,219
They knew who the man Jesus was.

693
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:33,099
These individuals, these Jews

694
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:35,379
that are in the synagogue there in Thessalonica,

695
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:38,259
they would have understood who Jesus was as a man.

696
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,099
They would have understood His crucifixion.

697
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,859
They would have been aware of these things.

698
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:47,099
And Paul says this Jesus whom I preach unto you

699
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,859
is Christ, the Anointed One,

700
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:54,019
the Messiah, the Son of God.

701
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:55,739
And here in the book of Colossians,

702
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,219
he presents Jesus Christ

703
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:01,059
to these believers.

704
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:03,019
Now, obviously, they've already understood

705
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:04,179
who Jesus Christ was.

706
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,539
They'd placed their faith and trust in Him

707
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,539
when they received the Gospel.

708
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,019
But Paul is beginning to...

709
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:13,179
You know, we sing the song more about Jesus.

710
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,099
I hope that you know more about Jesus today

711
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:17,379
than you did when you first got saved.

712
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:18,859
That you understand more of the working

713
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,939
of redemption today than the day you first got saved.

714
00:45:22,939 --> 00:45:24,979
And so Paul, because of these false teachers

715
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:26,899
coming in and saying various things,

716
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:28,779
and there are certain people groups

717
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:31,059
around the world that they're okay

718
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,899
if you believe in Jesus as just being

719
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:35,099
another small G-O-D.

720
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,619
They don't mind that you serve

721
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:38,219
a multiplicity of gods

722
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,299
and have all of these different deities

723
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:42,019
in which you would worship

724
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,979
because they do not mind you

725
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:47,859
believing that Jesus existed.

726
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:50,819
They're attacking who He really is

727
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:53,259
and His work that He completed.

728
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:55,659
And so Paul makes this presentation

729
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,339
to these believers in Colossae.

730
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,179
How do we respond?

731
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:01,859
Number two, I've simply said this,

732
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,419
the appropriate response.

733
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,139
The appropriate response.

734
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,739
When you read all of these things,

735
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,379
when you receive this great truth

736
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:12,379
that Paul reveals to these believers in Colossae,

737
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:14,099
when you see the Lord Jesus Christ

738
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,579
exalted in this position,

739
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,819
when you understand that He is the image

740
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:18,979
of the invisible God,

741
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:20,179
that He is the Creator,

742
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,219
He is the Redeemer,

743
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,539
He is the head of the body of the church,

744
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:24,819
what's the proper response?

745
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:27,979
Well, notice in verse 18.

746
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:30,819
The Bible says this at the end of verse 18.

747
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:33,059
That in all things,

748
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,899
He might have the preeminence.

749
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:39,339
That in all things,

750
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,459
He might have the preeminence.

751
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:45,299
Wouldn't that simply be

752
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,979
the logical conclusion that we would reach?

753
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,099
When we understand who He is.

754
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,619
When He's presented in the fashion

755
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:53,339
in which He has been.

756
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,219
And we understand who Jesus is,

757
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:57,059
it would only seem logical to me

758
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:58,219
that we would say,

759
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,539
yes, He deserves the preeminence

760
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,059
in every area of my life.

761
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,059
That word preeminence is the only place

762
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,979
in the New Testament in which it's found.

763
00:47:05,979 --> 00:47:07,579
And that word means to be first

764
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:10,819
or to hold the first place.

765
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:13,459
Doesn't He deserve that position?

766
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,019
Isn't our appropriate response

767
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:18,859
to the truth that is before us this morning

768
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:22,539
to say it's all about Jesus?

769
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,579
It should be this,

770
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,379
that we say like John the Baptist said

771
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:27,219
in John 3 and verse 30,

772
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,979
He must increase, I must decrease.

773
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,579
That in all things,

774
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:38,139
He might have the preeminence.

775
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:41,859
Oh, that we would live our lives in that fashion.

776
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,059
It's not about what I want,

777
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,019
it's about what God wants.

778
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,019
Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 6

779
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,139
and verses 19 and 20.

780
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,059
What?

781
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,419
Know ye not?

782
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:52,219
Right?

783
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:54,259
I think about the way in which

784
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:55,859
he starts that passage of Scripture

785
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:56,859
as if he's saying,

786
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:58,059
are you ignorant to this?

787
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:00,019
You know not this truth?

788
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:00,859
What's this truth?

789
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,859
That you've been bought with a price.

790
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:06,179
Therefore, the natural conclusion

791
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,579
of being bought with a price

792
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:09,059
is that you're to glorify God

793
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,259
in your body and your spirit,

794
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:11,739
which are His.

795
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:13,619
He owns us.

796
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,339
When we understand that without Him

797
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,339
we can do nothing,

798
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:18,299
when we understand that He has done for us

799
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,899
what I could not do for myself

800
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,779
and what no one else could do for me,

801
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:24,619
that I say, yes,

802
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,379
I want to give Him the preeminence.

803
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:30,059
I want to crown Him Lord of lords

804
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:31,419
in my life.

805
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:34,179
See, the reality is that He is Lord.

806
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:36,219
He is King.

807
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:37,379
There are times in which

808
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:39,099
in our lives individually,

809
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:43,019
He may not be the Lord and King of my life.

810
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,379
Who sits upon that throne

811
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:49,059
of your heart, of your life?

812
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,699
You know who wants to sit on that throne is self.

813
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,499
And it's a constant battle.

814
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,659
That's why Paul said,

815
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:59,579
I am crucified with Christ.

816
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:00,859
Because the constant battle

817
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:05,059
is that self wants to be first.

818
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:06,499
I think it was D.L. Moody that said

819
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:08,459
if He is not Lord of all,

820
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:11,379
He is not Lord at all.

821
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:13,459
What powerful statement

822
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:17,779
that old preacher of yesteryear made.

823
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:20,019
This morning as we look at this appropriate response,

824
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:21,659
we'd say first of all,

825
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,019
that we should crown Him Lord of our lives.

826
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:27,619
That He would be the Master in our lives.

827
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:30,299
That He would have the preeminence.

828
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,979
I believe that many times today,

829
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:33,739
unfortunately, there are people

830
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:34,979
that are looking for a Savior,

831
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:37,179
but not for a Master.

832
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:38,699
What do I mean by that?

833
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:40,499
Well, they want somebody to deliver them

834
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:42,219
from the penalty of sin,

835
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:45,859
but they're not interested in that same somebody

836
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,899
controlling their life.

837
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,459
Why? Because I have my ambitions.

838
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:51,499
I have my desires.

839
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:53,699
I have my...

840
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,659
But we've been bought with a price.

841
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,059
We're not our own.

842
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,379
Number two, how we should respond,

843
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:00,539
the appropriate response,

844
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,379
is that we would continue.

845
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:03,739
Notice in verse number 23,

846
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:10,259
The Bible says this, if you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved

847
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:14,479
away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every

848
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:18,859
creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a minister."

849
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:24,099
When you're speaking about this idea of continuing, you remember as we were studying the passage

850
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:29,459
of Scripture with the prayer of Paul, and we talked about the truth in verse number

851
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:33,899
11, that he said, strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all

852
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:37,299
patience and longsuffering, with joyfulness.

853
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:41,939
As we looked at that passage of Scripture and we understood the truth that what Paul

854
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:48,419
was giving for these believers to understand that what was produced was that spiritual

855
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:55,019
maturity, that endurance, that steadfastness, that continuing, if you will, to do the will

856
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,019
of God.

857
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:01,339
And we see here in verse number 23 that he says, if you continue in the faith, grounded

858
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:07,379
and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and

859
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:10,459
which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made

860
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:11,459
a minister.

861
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:15,899
So notice with me and consider with me the danger that is present that they would be

862
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:16,979
moved away.

863
00:51:16,979 --> 00:51:19,619
How are they going to be moved away?

864
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,739
False teachers.

865
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:22,739
False teachers.

866
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:29,059
Now, we'd understand here that he says that you would continue in the faith grounded and

867
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,059
settled.

868
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,779
Again, we see the importance, the significance of discipleship and spiritual maturity through

869
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:38,499
this phraseology of being grounded and settled.

870
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:43,459
I would say this, that if we're grounded and settled, it will go a long way to keep us

871
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:46,659
from being moved away.

872
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:48,859
Because we're grounded and settled.

873
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:56,899
Listen, I hope that no one could come to you and say that you could get to heaven by your

874
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:58,779
own works.

875
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:04,699
I hope that you're grounded and settled enough to know that's a false teaching.

876
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:06,059
And here's why that's a false teaching.

877
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:08,419
You have some verses that you can go to.

878
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:11,519
And you can say, well, the Bible says this, and here's a passage of Scripture that deals

879
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:12,519
with this.

880
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:16,899
It's not of our own works, not of the works of our own righteousness that we have done.

881
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:18,499
We're not clothed in our righteousness.

882
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:21,379
We're clothed in the righteousness of Christ.

883
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:25,579
The Bible says that it's a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

884
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:30,299
Just to use one example, if we're grounded and settled, it will go a long way to keep

885
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,859
us from being moved away.

886
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:38,139
You know, the believers in the region of Galatia, as Paul is ministering to those believers

887
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:42,099
in Galatians chapter number one, of course, we know that it's a number of churches there

888
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:47,439
in Galatia, a church in Antioch and Pisidia and Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

889
00:52:47,439 --> 00:52:50,039
And it says in verse number two, that the church is in Galatia.

890
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,019
But notice with me, the Bible says this in verse number six.

891
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,519
He says in Galatians 1 verse number six,

892
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:03,559
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ

893
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:06,339
unto another gospel.

894
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:11,559
And then he says this, which is not another, but there be some that trouble you and would

895
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,879
pervert the gospel of Christ.

896
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:19,639
But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you that, that which

897
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:25,999
we have preached unto you, let him be accursed, strong language.

898
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:29,859
But what happened in these churches in Galatia, there are some false teachers there, the Judaizers

899
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:34,599
in particular, and those false teachers were teaching something other.

900
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:39,679
And Paul says, I am, I marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into

901
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:41,879
the grace of Christ unto another gospel.

902
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:45,339
Notice that phraseology, that they were so soon removed.

903
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:47,239
What does he say in Colossians 1?

904
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:55,159
He says this, if you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away.

905
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:57,319
Now let me say this.

906
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:03,359
These people in Colossae that are being written to in Colossians in this book, they are referred

907
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,079
to in verse number two as the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, which are at Colossae.

908
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,539
They're saved people.

909
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,219
We believe in eternal security.

910
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,459
We are kept by the power of God.

911
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:19,699
Jesus said in John chapter number 10, that my sheep hear my voice and I know them and

912
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:23,779
I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish.

913
00:54:23,779 --> 00:54:27,899
I'm so thankful for the truth of eternal security.

914
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:33,579
Here in verse number 23, he's not teaching that they would lose their salvation.

915
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:37,419
If they've been saved, they are secure in Christ.

916
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:38,419
So what is he teaching?

917
00:54:38,419 --> 00:54:39,419
What are the false teachers?

918
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:45,660
Why do the false teachers come after saved people if they can't cause you to be lost?

919
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,579
Because they can attack your effectiveness.

920
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:53,759
You think about the work of a false teacher, bringing in confusion and chaos and all sorts

921
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:54,759
of things.

922
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:58,819
And it begins that you're not going to continue to preach the same message that you receive

923
00:54:58,819 --> 00:55:02,979
because you're so messed up and you're so confused about what the real truth is.

924
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:08,259
And now what's happening is your effectiveness on reaching other people with that powerful

925
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:13,819
gospel that's able to save souls, your effectiveness is hindered.

926
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:17,459
If you don't know the truth of eternal security, how are you going to help somebody with eternal

927
00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:19,259
security?

928
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:24,380
If you don't know the truth that Jesus is the only Savior, that Jesus Christ himself

929
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:29,459
said, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

930
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:33,699
If Peter stood with great power and said, neither is there salvation in any other for

931
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:37,579
there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

932
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:42,139
If we don't know those truths, because some false teachers have gotten us all kinds of

933
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:47,619
sideways and we've been moved away, I'm still secure in Christ, but my effectiveness on

934
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:51,579
reaching the world with the gospel is greatly hindered.

935
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:57,380
And that's what the false teacher wants to do.

936
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,859
He wants to keep people from being saved.

937
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:07,660
And so the attack upon the church that the enemy brings on introducing false teaching,

938
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:14,459
these men that are referenced in Jude, verse number 3 and 4, that had crept in unawares,

939
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:19,539
that turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

940
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:23,500
Jude says, it was needful that I write unto you.

941
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
It was necessary.

942
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,299
It was of utmost importance.

943
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,299
Why?

944
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:28,859
Because these false teachers are coming in.

945
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:33,339
I'm thankful for my security in Christ, but I want to continue in this and I want to be

946
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:34,339
grounded and settled.

947
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:38,579
And it's not the idea that if I get all kinds of sideways because of a false teacher that

948
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:39,579
I'm going to lose my salvation.

949
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:46,380
No, but I'm going to lose my effectiveness.

950
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,299
There's a lot of people today in our world that kind of carry that idea, you just be

951
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:56,899
sincere about what you believe and at the end everything's going to be okay.

952
00:56:56,899 --> 00:57:01,179
Just sincerely embrace and believe what you believe.

953
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:02,739
All roads lead to heaven.

954
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:05,380
I've heard it so many times.

955
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,660
It's just not true.

956
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,660
It's just not true.

957
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,779
But the false teachers, the enemy, right?

958
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:17,419
The God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light

959
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:21,459
of the glorious gospel should shine unto them, according to 2 Corinthians, chapter number

960
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:22,459
4.

961
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:27,099
And so we find that these false teachers, they're going to continue to attack and to

962
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:29,139
continue to try to tear down.

963
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:36,099
And when you or when I stand up and I say, Jesus is the only way, oh man, they don't

964
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:37,099
like that.

965
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:39,339
They don't like that.

966
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:43,059
In fact, I preached a message several years ago about that very subject, Jesus is the

967
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,019
only way.

968
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:52,059
There was a large, large church, a Baptist church, unfortunately, in New York City.

969
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:57,579
The pastor stood up and he preached a message, and in his message, he said, this thinking

970
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:03,339
that Jesus is the only way is outdated, and it's just not true, and you can't support

971
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:05,459
it biblically.

972
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:12,139
And when he made that statement in a church of 10 or 15,000 people, you could hear in

973
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:20,099
the background applause and hooting and hollering at the support of the statement that was made.

974
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:22,660
How sad.

975
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,539
People are being, listen, they're condemned already.

976
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:33,479
And if we would, if the false teachers get their way and they subvert and they come in

977
00:58:33,479 --> 00:58:39,979
and they undermine the truth of the Word of God, then we find that people will continue

978
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:43,119
to be lost in their sins.

979
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,899
And so Paul says, let me exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

980
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:49,099
Let me help you.

981
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:54,820
Let me remind you, and let me help you understand that He is the image of the invisible God.

982
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,179
He's the Creator.

983
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:57,479
He's the Redeemer.

984
00:58:57,479 --> 00:58:59,760
He's the head of the body of the church.

985
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,500
And here's your appropriate response to such truth, that you would crown Him Lord and King

986
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,700
of your life, that in all things He would have the preeminence, and that you would continue.

987
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,059
Don't be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

988
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:17,099
No, be grounded and settled.

989
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,700
You understand this morning that the right way is not always the popular way.

990
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,539
I'd still rather be right with just a few people than be wrong with the multitudes.

991
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:28,539
Amen.

992
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:29,539
Let's pray.

993
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:30,539
Father, we love You.

994
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:32,059
We thank You for loving us.

995
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:34,739
We thank You for this passage of Scripture.

996
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:41,179
What great truth that You give us in Your Word.

997
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:44,500
We thank You for our Savior.

998
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,659
We thank You for who He is, God in flesh.

999
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:48,820
We thank You for what He has done.

1000
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:55,299
We thank You for the redeeming work at Calvary, His substitutionary atonement, His death,

1001
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:57,820
burial, and glorious resurrection.

1002
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:03,140
I pray this morning that You would help Your people.

1003
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,779
We know this is Your church.

1004
01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:12,219
church, God help us to be grounded and settled. Help us Lord to stand for truth,

1005
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:18,699
to contend for the faith. I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

1006
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:23,939
maybe they've been influenced by some false teachers, some false doctrine, maybe

1007
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:31,099
they've been told that there's some other way to get to heaven. I pray that

1008
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:34,499
this morning the truth of your word, the Holy Spirit would take it and minister as

1009
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:39,299
only he can. Would you be exalted in our midst during these few moments of

1010
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:42,859
invitation? We'll thank you for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we

1011
01:00:42,859 --> 01:00:46,659
pray. Would you stand with me? Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. We will

1012
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:52,139
have a moment of invitation here and I encourage you at home to allow the Lord

1013
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:55,299
to have his way in your life as you consider these truths from the Word of

1014
01:00:55,299 --> 01:01:00,379
God. As Kimberly plays we'll have a moment of invitation.
