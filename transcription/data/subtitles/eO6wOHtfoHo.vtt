WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
you through the book of Colossians, and I have thoroughly enjoyed already these several

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.000
messages that I've been able to prepare and deliver from this great book, and it's only

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.539
four chapters in the book of Colossians, and some have asked, is it really going to take

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.539
us all year?

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.700
Well, that kind of depends, and this is message number five, and we'll get through almost

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.139
the end of chapter number one today, and I have another message next week on chapter

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:28.940
number one, but we'll continue to make progress through this book, and you'll recall last

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.740
week as we looked at verses nine through 14 that we dealt with the truth with regard

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.099
to the prayer of Paul for the believers in Colossians.

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:44.419
What a blessing it was to kind of dig through those verses of scripture and to see exactly

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:50.740
how it was that Paul was praying for them, and we think about the ministry of intercessory

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.459
prayer, the great privilege that we have to go to God on the behalf of others, and what

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:58.459
a blessing.

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:03.139
As we continue to study through this book, you'll remember that as we dealt with the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:09.019
prayer of Paul in verses nine through 14, we kind of said some things with regard to

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:13.620
the prayer, and one of the things that we said is we need to know some things about

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.260
people in order to pray for them, to engage in this ministry of intercessory prayer, and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.360
some of what the apostle Paul knew was the fact that there were false teachers that were

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.839
present there in Colossae, and knowing that those false teachers were present, of course

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:35.160
he prayed that they would be spiritually mature, that they would grow in their walk with Christ,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.760
and I often said, and I have often said over the years, and I said it last week as well,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.120
that one of the best ways to combat false teaching is spiritual maturity, spiritual

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
growth.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.720
When you know the Word of God and you know the truth of God's Word, it enables you to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.959
be able to stand against the attacks of the enemy, it enables you to be able to stand

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.000
against the subtlety of the false teachers.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.480
I know that I've said many times that they will use our vocabulary, but they use a different

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.080
definition, and so you've got to be careful with these false teachers.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.880
They're very sly and cunning, and the subtlety that you find within false teachers, and so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.639
the apostle Paul understood that those false teachers were present, and that gives us some

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.520
understanding as to the next several verses that are before us this morning, and really

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.919
this passage of Scripture, Colossians 1, we'll be looking at verses 15 through 23, is one

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:38.039
of the most powerful passages in briefly describing the person of Jesus Christ, and I don't really

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.360
think you could probably go anywhere else in the New Testament and find just a handful

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.839
of verses that so powerfully gives us truth with regard to the person of Jesus Christ.

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:54.240
Obviously, you can compare Scripture with Scripture, you can go to a whole host of passages,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.000
but in these few verses we find that Paul is going to provide this great truth, powerful

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.660
truth, and as these false teachers were present and active in the city of Colossae, one thing

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.059
that we'd understand about false teachers is they all have one thing in common.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.179
One thing that I believe that all false teachers have in common is their attack upon the person

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.160
of Jesus Christ.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.380
And false teachers will always have… there are all sorts of things, you can look at false

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.619
teachers and you can find all sorts of various teachings and various creeds and religious

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:34.279
activities, if you will, that they would encourage you to be participating in, but one thing

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:39.440
that is common amongst false teachers is their attack upon the person of Jesus Christ.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.240
We can ask ourselves this morning, why is that?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.399
Why is there unity amongst the false teachers on this one point of an attack upon the person

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:49.520
of Jesus Christ?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.360
Well, if the enemy is able to cause people to err regarding the person and work of Jesus

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.759
Christ, we understand that the consequences are grave and eternal.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.320
And so therefore, there's this unity, if you will, amongst these false teachers on

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.440
the attack against the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.600
Usually false teachers will not deny the existence of Jesus Christ.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.320
They won't try to come in and say, no, Jesus doesn't exist, and he's just… no, no, they'll

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.239
just not give the fullness of who Jesus really is.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:30.559
They're okay, false teachers are okay with someone believing that Jesus existed, they're

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:35.399
okay with somebody saying that he was a good man, that he was even a prophet, but they're

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.399
not okay with saying that he is the Son of God and the only Savior for mankind, and that

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:45.279
of course is what we find the Word of God to clearly teach us.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:49.779
And so therefore, this attack upon who he is.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.720
If you'll remember on Wednesday evening, several weeks ago, we began studying about the doctrine

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.160
of Christ, and one of the passages in which we started with was there in Matthew when

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.079
the Lord Jesus Christ said to the disciples, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:10.920
And of course, the disciples provided an answer, and in that answer, what was revealed not

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.119
only to the Lord, of course he already knew it, but their acknowledgment would also reveal

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:22.739
to them, and it reveals to us, that there was confusion with regard to who Jesus is.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.119
Some say that you're John the Baptist, some say that you're one of the prophets, Elijah

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:33.119
or Jeremiah or one of the others, and there was confusion about who Jesus is, and we find

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.720
that still today, that confusion exists.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.200
And of course, Jesus then turns the attention to his disciples and he says, but whom say

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.579
ye that I am?

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:49.799
And Peter stood with great confidence and boldness and he said, thou art the Christ,

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.399
the Son of the living God.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.959
What a great declaration, a powerful truth that was revealed there in the Gospel of Matthew,

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:03.399
and we find that here in Colossae, the Greek philosophers and the Gnostics, they really

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.959
didn't believe, they didn't really mind if people believed in Jesus.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.079
I mean, think about the timing.

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:15.640
This is being written nearly 25 to 35 years after the crucifixion and resurrection of

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.000
Jesus Christ.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.519
No doubt there were people that knew that Jesus existed.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.760
They didn't mind if you believed that Jesus existed, as long as you did not believe that

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.000
he was God in flesh and the Savior of the world.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.239
Therefore, Paul declares powerfully and concisely who Christ is.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.839
It is important for us to note that as we look at this passage of Scripture, that Paul

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.160
actually did not go forth and attack the false teaching.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.640
You know what he did?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.959
He just exalted the Lord Jesus Christ, and he showed who Jesus is.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:58.160
See, one of the things, I took some classes in seminary Bible college that deal with all

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.079
of the coltonisms and what have you, and they try to prepare you on how to talk to people

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.519
with different perspectives and what have you, and you know what I've learned in life?

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:11.239
I've learned, not to say that the classes were of no value, but what I've learned in

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.880
life is that if we would simply just exalt the Lord Jesus Christ, I don't need to answer

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.720
all of the questions of the false teachers, I don't need to deal with all of those things,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.320
I simply need to elevate and exalt our Savior.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.519
Now, knowing some of those things may help us, but I've found in life that often, as

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:38.119
we would deal with some of those particular aspects of maybe a cult or a false teacher,

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:42.799
we can find ourselves winning an argument, or engaged in an argument, but never actually

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:49.140
able to present who Jesus is in a fashion in which they might come to a saving knowledge

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.079
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.079
Why?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:56.880
Because we just want to argue about the points of what their religion teaches versus what

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.880
the Bible teaches, and we just begin to get in an argument, and you'll find very few people

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.839
are willing to acknowledge that they're wrong.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:06.399
So we just exalt Christ, and we just elevate Christ.

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:10.720
If you're taking notes this morning, that's what I've titled the message, The Exalted

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720
Christ.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
The Exalted Christ.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.959
In this passage of Scripture, I want you to notice, if you're taking notes, number one,

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.799
the way that Christ is described.

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:21.720
Notice with me in verse number 12, really, we'll kind of start there.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.220
I know that the passage will deal with primarily verses 15 through 23, but let's go back to

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.220
verse number 12.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.719
The Bible says this, giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet, to be partakers

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:38.840
of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.359
and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:48.979
his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:52.940
Who is, and so the reason why I start it there back in verse number 12 is because you do

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.080
begin in verse number 15, and it says, who is the image of the invisible God.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.840
We understand that he's referring back to his dear Son that is mentioned at the end

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.460
of verse number 13, and it's carried through, he's referring to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:11.479
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature, for by him were

00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:16.359
all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible,

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:22.599
whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by him

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.559
and for him.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:30.059
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:34.419
And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:40.340
the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence, for it pleased the Father

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:45.500
that in him should all fullness dwell.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.460
And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him, to reconcile all things

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:56.979
unto himself, by him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, and you,

00:09:56.979 --> 00:10:00.219
that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind.

00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:05.699
by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:07.819
the body of His flesh through death

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:10.499
to present you holy and unblameable

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:12.819
and unreprovable in His sight.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.579
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled,

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:17.539
and be not moved away from the hope

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:19.939
of the Gospel which ye have heard,

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:21.739
which was preached to every creature

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:23.139
which is under heaven,

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.519
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister."

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.179
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.919
notice the way Christ is described.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:32.639
The way that He is described.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:35.239
Number one, we find right here in v. 15

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:37.439
and really down through a number of verses,

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:38.879
v. 19 in particular,

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:41.239
but the first way in which He is described

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:44.999
is that He is the image of the invisible God.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:47.319
John 4 and v. 24 when Jesus is meeting

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:48.979
with the woman of the well there

00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:50.659
when He says that He must needs go

00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:52.979
through Samaria, He's having that conversation.

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:54.879
And in John 4 and v. 24,

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:57.379
the Bible says that God is a Spirit.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:59.359
They that worship Him must worship Him

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.919
in spirit and in truth.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:03.399
And so we find that Paul,

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:06.599
as he's elevating and exalting the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.639
the first manner in which he describes

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:11.939
our wonderful Savior is that He is the image

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:13.279
of the invisible God.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.919
That word image is important.

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:16.759
It means the likeness.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.359
It really means the manifestation.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:21.239
And it helps us to understand

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:23.639
what the Apostle Paul is saying here.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.799
And it helps us to understand the deity of Christ.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.319
Again, as we compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:33.779
what Paul is saying to these believers in Colossae

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.899
is that Jesus is God.

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:40.139
That He is the very God in flesh.

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:42.819
That He is the image of the invisible God.

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:45.179
You understand that at the incarnation,

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:46.979
He did not become God.

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:48.959
He is not like God.

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.499
He is God.

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:54.259
And He always has been and forever will be.

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:55.899
He is God.

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:58.679
And we find that the Bible would reveal to us

00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:03.399
that Jesus manifested God to people.

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:06.059
See, we mentioned already that John 4 and verse 24,

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.399
God is a spirit.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.559
And so we find that as Jesus would manifest the Father,

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.719
and He uses that terminology often

00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:15.679
in the book of John in particular,

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.079
and that word manifest,

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:20.639
it means to make known or visible.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.079
To make known or to make visible.

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:25.359
And so if God is a spirit,

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:27.619
we find that Jesus as God,

00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:31.499
when He was robed in human flesh at the incarnation,

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:33.599
He did not cease to be God.

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:37.279
He continued to be God because He is God.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:40.819
And He manifested, He made known

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:45.139
or made visible what God is or who God is.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.099
And we find that in John 1,

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.679
hold your place here in the book of Colossians.

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:50.619
We'll look at a few verses in the book of John.

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.599
And I want you to notice in John 1,

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:55.959
a passage in which we often reference

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:59.179
with regard to the incarnation and what power it is.

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:02.099
We'll look at the first three verses in just a moment,

00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:04.979
but I want you to look at verse number 14 with me here

00:13:04.979 --> 00:13:07.419
as we speak about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.139
being the image of the invisible God.

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:11.659
The Bible says in verse number 14,

00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:13.859
and the Word was made flesh.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.339
Now we know in the beginning of this chapter

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:18.939
that the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the Word

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.899
and the Word was with God and the Word was God.

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:24.359
And so Jesus is the Word of God.

00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:26.719
It's a name that was assigned to Him.

00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:28.319
And He, it says this,

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:31.799
the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:34.039
tabernacled among us.

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:38.119
And it says here, and we beheld His glory,

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:40.719
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.319
full of grace and truth.

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:43.999
How could they behold His glory?

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:46.079
Because He manifested Himself, right?

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.499
He made it visible.

00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:50.439
He made it known through the incarnation.

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:51.979
Look at verse number 18.

00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:55.339
No man hath seen God at any time.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.979
The only begotten Son,

00:13:56.979 --> 00:13:58.899
which is in the bosom of the Father,

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:01.619
He hath declared Him.

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:03.899
In John chapter number 17,

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:07.479
we find that the Bible makes this truth known to us

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:10.379
with regard to the day in which Jesus,

00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.059
He says the hour is now come.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.099
He would soon go to the cross of Calvary.

00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:16.979
And as He's praying here in this passage of Scripture,

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:19.899
many wonderful things are revealed to us here,

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:22.999
but we find that just as Colossians 1

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:25.539
deals with the eternality of Christ,

00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:29.239
so also John 17 deals with the eternality of Christ.

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:32.679
Just as Colossians 1 deals with the fact

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:33.939
that He is the image,

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:36.359
the manifestation of the invisible God,

00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:39.119
so also we find that truth in John 17.

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:40.779
Notice in verse number five,

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.319
Jesus says this,

00:14:42.319 --> 00:14:47.319
and now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self,

00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:48.799
notice this,

00:14:48.819 --> 00:14:51.999
with the glory which I had with Thee

00:14:51.999 --> 00:14:55.439
before the world was.

00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:57.219
The eternality of Christ,

00:14:57.219 --> 00:14:59.499
we see that over in the book of Colossians,

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:00.579
stay here in John,

00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:03.099
I'm gonna read another couple of verses here,

00:15:03.099 --> 00:15:05.899
but in the book of Colossians in chapter number one,

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:08.799
we see the eternality of Christ in verse number 17

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:12.059
when the Bible says He is before all things,

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:15.379
and by Him all things consist.

00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:18.839
So in John 17, in verse number five,

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:20.079
we see the eternality,

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.599
and then we see the manifestation,

00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:24.199
look in verse number six of John 17,

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:25.139
the Bible says this,

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:25.979
Jesus said,

00:15:25.979 --> 00:15:29.319
I have manifested Thy name unto the men

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:31.919
which Thou gavest me out of the world.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.079
Thine they were,

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:35.279
and Thou gavest them me,

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.799
and they have kept Thy word.

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:40.479
Again, that word manifest means to make known

00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:41.919
or make visible,

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:44.859
and so Jesus, often as He was walking

00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:47.759
upon the earth during His earthly ministry,

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:50.279
He made the claim of deity,

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:53.039
and we understand that He made the claim of deity

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.999
because often the religious leaders

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:57.319
were ready to stone Him and kill Him

00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:58.659
because of the statements,

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.719
the declarations that He made,

00:16:00.719 --> 00:16:03.999
and so we find not only does the Bible tell us here

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:05.679
in Colossians 1 and 15

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.999
that He is the image of the invisible God,

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:11.479
I want you to notice what is said in verse number 19,

00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:13.739
we'll read the rest of verse 15 here in just a moment,

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:16.719
but look and skip down to verse number 19.

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:18.199
Notice what it says,

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:20.859
for it pleased the Father.

00:16:20.859 --> 00:16:24.079
Now, you understand that as we look here

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:25.439
at this passage of Scripture,

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:29.079
and we begin to see the Trinity or the triunity,

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:30.439
and we see that the Bible says

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:31.839
that it pleased the Father,

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:35.559
that in Him, speaking of Jesus Christ,

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:39.239
His Son, as He mentions in verse number 13,

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:41.519
when it talks about the kingdom of His dear Son,

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:43.859
we see that the Bible says that it pleased the Father,

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:46.679
that in Him, notice this phrase,

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:51.059
should all fullness dwell.

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:56.059
Now, Paul, again, without attacking the false teachers

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.299
and saying here's where they're wrong,

00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:58.739
here's where they're wrong,

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:00.559
he's exalting Christ,

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:05.019
but in so doing, he's exposing the false teachers

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:09.059
because they had this idea of these angels

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:11.339
and various created beings and so on and so forth

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.559
that there would be aspects

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:16.119
in which there would be certain amounts of divinity

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.199
and power and so on and so forth,

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:20.479
and here, the Apostle Paul says,

00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:23.239
in Him, in Jesus Christ,

00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:25.959
it pleased the Father that in Him

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:29.739
should all fullness dwell.

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:32.079
The entirety of it.

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:33.999
The whole sum of it.

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:38.599
The total of all divine power and attributes

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.799
are in Jesus Christ.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:44.619
All fullness, and then it says dwell.

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:46.659
The idea of that word dwell,

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:48.359
not only does it mean to be present,

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.839
but it carries with it the idea

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.759
of being at home permanently.

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:54.459
In other words, He always has been

00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:56.839
and He always will be God.

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:59.279
The truth that we find, again,

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.579
this passage of Scripture is exalting the Lord Jesus Christ

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:05.299
and we find the way in which He is described

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:07.599
in John 1, we looked at a few verses,

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:09.539
but in verse number 16,

00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:12.259
the Bible in that passage of Scripture

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:14.179
tells us this truth,

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:17.499
and of His fullness have all we received

00:18:17.499 --> 00:18:20.179
and grace for grace.

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:23.539
And so Paul is telling these believers in Colossae,

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:26.779
let me help you understand a little bit more

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.259
about Jesus Christ.

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:31.299
Let me help you understand who He is

00:18:31.299 --> 00:18:35.859
in a very distinct and a very powerful

00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:36.919
and concise way.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:39.839
Number one, He is the image of the invisible God.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.879
Number two, He is the Creator.

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:44.199
At the end of verse number 15,

00:18:44.199 --> 00:18:46.879
the Bible says the firstborn of every creature.

00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:50.000
Now, we need to be careful as understanding

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.879
what is meant by this phraseology,

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:53.679
the firstborn of every creature.

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:56.279
The false teachers will tell you

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:59.319
that that means Jesus was created.

00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:00.479
That's what they'll tell you.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:03.279
He was the firstborn, so therefore He was created.

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.679
Well, that's in violation of Scripture.

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:07.279
Scripture does not support that

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.259
when you compare Scripture with Scripture.

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:12.259
Also, we find that that word firstborn

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:15.579
not only carries with it maybe the firstborn

00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:19.979
as a child, but you think about the distinction

00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:23.539
in the Old Testament of the heir, the firstborn,

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:25.779
the one that has supremacy,

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:29.339
that receives the inheritance, that owns the things,

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:32.339
and you find that here in speaking of Jesus Christ,

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.739
when He says that He's the firstborn of every creature,

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:37.039
it does not mean that He was created.

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:40.199
He is the Creator, and that is what we find here,

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:42.519
not only the way that Christ is described,

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:44.279
that He is the image of the invisible God,

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:46.559
but number two, He is the Creator,

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:49.839
and we find that here as we look in verse number 15

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:52.279
down through verse number 17

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:55.000
in understanding the work of creation,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.079
that the Bible says that He is the firstborn

00:19:57.079 --> 00:20:02.079
of every creature, for by Him were all things made.

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:07.879
created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether

00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:12.479
they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:19.719
created by Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and by Him all things

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:25.319
consist." Now we'd have to understand and make this note that the truth of John

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:29.839
chapter number one, coupled with the truth of Colossians chapter number one,

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:36.519
these passages of Scripture do not contradict the record of Genesis 1.

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:43.639
Rather, we would find that these passages of Scripture complement what we find in

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:48.159
Genesis chapter number one and provide further details. When you read Genesis

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:52.439
chapter number one, you find very simply where the Bible says, in the beginning

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:59.359
God created the heaven and the earth, a passage in which we're familiar with. We

00:20:59.399 --> 00:21:04.159
find that in John chapter number one and Colossians chapter number one, that God

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:09.519
is going to, through revelation, the divine revelation of the Word of God, He

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:16.699
is going to give us further details with regard to the work of Jesus Christ in

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:20.999
creation. He's the Creator. And we find that in John chapter number one, the

00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:24.439
Bible says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:30.079
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:35.399
without Him was not anything made that was made. It's obvious in

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:39.159
John 1, as well as Colossians 1, that he's speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:46.539
And it says, for by Him, in verse number 16, were all things created. I'm thankful

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:51.759
that God gives us the truth of creation. I've made known, especially as we were

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:56.959
studying the book of Genesis, that the truth of creation is not isolated to the

00:21:56.959 --> 00:22:02.879
first few chapters of the book of Genesis. The truth of creation is dealt

00:22:02.879 --> 00:22:06.919
with throughout the whole of God's Word. You will find various passages of

00:22:06.919 --> 00:22:11.279
Scripture throughout the Old and New Testament that declare to us the

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:17.039
creation of the universe, and the fact that our God is the Creator. And here, as

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:21.319
we would think about the truth that is given to us, for by Him were all things

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:26.079
created that are in heaven, that are in earth, that we would understand that this

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:33.959
truth of creation is not arrived to by reasoning, but rather through revelation.

00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:41.279
Many have tried to reason. Many have offered various ideas as to how the

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:46.879
cosmos began, and all of those things. And science has offered its theories, no

00:22:46.879 --> 00:22:50.879
doubt. And we understand that we're living in the midst of a generation that

00:22:50.879 --> 00:22:55.119
are dealing with a number of false teachers that have denied the Creator

00:22:55.119 --> 00:23:02.039
God, and they have offered some other theory as to the universe in which

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:08.439
we live in, where we came from. But we find that the truth is not arrived to by

00:23:08.439 --> 00:23:18.039
reasoning, but by revelation. One who was there, God, reveals to us how He did what

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:25.359
He did. You could enter into a room, and you could have some observation of

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:31.479
something that took place, and as you would look at that particular example

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:38.279
that would be before you, you could try to, through using reason, conclude what

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:42.799
was going on, and how things started there. And maybe you're looking at some

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:47.919
sophisticated type of machinery, and you go in, and you begin to evaluate, and you

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:53.199
make all kinds of calculations, and you begin to try to give an explanation

00:23:53.199 --> 00:24:00.119
through reason as to how this process started. And then somebody comes in that

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:06.599
was there, that started the process, and says, let me explain to you exactly what

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:12.399
happened here. Because through your theory, you're not going to reach the

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:17.879
proper conclusion, because it cannot be reached through reasoning. In fact, if you

00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:22.799
were to go and see a pendulum swinging back and forth, and you could make some

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:27.239
measurements as to the distance in which that pendulum is traveling in each

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:33.999
direction, if you were, you know, up to speed with physics and mathematics and

00:24:33.999 --> 00:24:37.359
all of those types of things, you could work all sorts of calculations, and

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:42.919
through all of your calculations, you may be able to determine when that pendulum

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:49.119
will stop swinging. But if you use the same calculations, and you try to go

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:53.159
backwards, and try to find when it started swinging, you're gonna find

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:57.839
yourself in a mess. The reason why is because you would eventually get to the

00:24:57.839 --> 00:25:01.359
place that your calculations would really have said that that thing would

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:04.759
have to be spinning all the way around in order for it to still be spinning at

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:08.279
the distance, or still going back and forth in the distance in which it was

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:13.079
currently moving. And so somebody comes in and says, no, actually this is what we

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:18.279
did, this is how we started the process. And so we find that the truth of

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:23.639
creation is a truth that is revealed to us through the Creator, through God.

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:28.999
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable, not only for

00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:33.879
doctrine, but we find that Paul says there in 2 Timothy

00:25:33.879 --> 00:25:37.799
chapter number 3, that it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:42.119
for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be perfect, throughly

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:47.199
furnished unto all good works. And so God has given us His Word, He's given us

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:51.479
the account of creation. Notice, as we would begin to think about God being the

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:56.559
Creator, that He is the one who was there, and He is the one that gives us the

00:25:56.559 --> 00:26:00.959
record. He created everything, and He controls everything. The Bible says in

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:06.439
verse number 16, notice it says, all things were created by Him. It tells us

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:11.799
that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible. I heard a

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:16.279
story, not really a story, it was an account yesterday, I heard an account of

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:23.359
someone in some desert over in Africa found the smallest species of some type

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:28.039
of a land animal. And they're going through all this sort of thing, and they

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:32.719
were giving the measurements, and it was microscopic, the size of this thing, and

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:36.479
some people had discovered this thing. Listen, God created all things, visible

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:41.319
and invisible. The Bible says here this, whether they be thrones or dominions or

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:44.279
principalities or powers. It's interesting, because here in verse

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:48.679
number 16, when He begins to deal with that thrones, dominions, principalities,

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:52.039
and powers, you will see that He's speaking of the angel world. You know,

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:59.519
angels are created beings. God created the angels. In the book of Ephesians, in

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:04.079
chapter number 6, as you would begin to deal with the whole armor of God and the

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:08.519
the battle that we're engaged in, you would find that Paul says in Ephesians

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:12.159
6 and verse number 12, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:16.279
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:21.559
against spiritual wickedness in high places. See, these false teachers in

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:26.239
Colossae, they were dealing with some things with regard to angels, and they

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:30.759
were dealing with some angel worship. We'll find that later, near the end of

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:35.159
chapter number 2, in particular, where that's dealt with. But you find here, as

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:40.639
Paul is exalting the Lord Jesus Christ, that he says, listen, he created

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:47.479
everything, including the angels. Some people would like to think that Jesus is

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:53.599
actually lower than an angel in his power and so on and so forth, because he

00:27:53.639 --> 00:27:59.479
came as a man. But as we studied the book of Hebrews, we understood that he came in

00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:05.239
that fashion so that he could die and redeem mankind. He had to come in the

00:28:05.239 --> 00:28:11.679
form of a man. This is God's plan. By the way, I'm so thankful for God's plan. We

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:16.679
find that the Bible continues and says this, all things were created by him and

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:25.799
for him. Not only that, he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:31.799
Hebrews 1 and verse number 3 gives us truth with regard, again, to this subject

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:36.359
matter of the creation. It tells us in Hebrews 1 and verse number 3, who being

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:41.319
the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person, it sounds

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:45.759
similar to what we're studying in here in Colossians 1, upholding all things by

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:50.639
the word of his power. When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the

00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:56.799
right hand of the majesty on high. And then it tells us being made so much

00:28:56.799 --> 00:29:01.639
better than the angels. And what we find in verse number 3, not only the fact

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:05.639
that it says he's the express image of his person, upholding all things by the

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:10.359
word of his power. Not only did he create all things, but he is the keeper of all

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:15.159
things. If you remove God, the whole universe is gonna fall apart. It really

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:22.839
is. Because by him all things consist. He holds it all together. And we find that

00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:27.679
here, the believers in Colossians, by preservation for us this morning, when

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:32.519
we're looking at this exalted Christ, we find that he is the image of the

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:38.799
invisible God that he manifested, made known, made visible God to man. We find

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:44.319
that he is the creator. We find, number three, that he is the redeemer. I'm so

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:49.039
thankful that he is the creator. But I'm telling you, the truth that he is the

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:55.759
redeemer causes me to rejoice greatly. Because without his redeeming work, if he

00:29:55.759 --> 00:30:02.079
was the creator but not the redeemer, we'd all have a destination in Lake

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:04.079
Idaho.

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:15.119
a fire. Right? He is the Creator. He is the Redeemer. We looked at those verses of Scripture

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:20.799
last week in verses 12-14. And as we looked at that passage of Scripture last week, we

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:26.399
noted the four powerful statements that were made. And just to quickly review, in verse

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:31.999
number 12, the Bible says that He hath made us meat to be partakers. And what a great

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:39.119
word that word meat. It means to make qualified. The reality that we could not qualify ourselves

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:47.159
for heaven, but He qualified us. He made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:54.159
the saints in light. You can't qualify yourself and I can't qualify myself for heaven. But

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:58.999
through the imputed righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, He hath made us meat. He hath

00:30:58.999 --> 00:31:04.559
made us qualified. Isn't that awesome? It says this in verse number 13, that He delivered

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:13.439
us from the power of darkness. Hallelujah. Not only that, but He translated us into the

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:19.779
kingdom of His dear Son. And then we find in verse number 14, He spoke about the truth

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:26.399
of redemption, the forgiveness through His precious blood. And now, once again, the Apostle

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:34.119
Paul is going to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ by speaking about His work of redemption.

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:39.239
Notice in verse number 20, and we'll get back to verse number 18 here in just a moment,

00:31:39.239 --> 00:31:44.599
but notice in verse number 20, the Bible says this, and having made peace through the blood

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:52.399
of His cross by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself. By Him, I say, whether they

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:58.559
be things on earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometime alienated and enemies

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:06.479
in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled. Now just think here for a moment

00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:09.659
as we think about these great truths that have already been revealed to us in verse

00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:16.319
number 20, the peace that we can have with God through the blood of His cross. In Romans

00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:21.959
chapter number 5, the Bible speaks about peace with God. Often as the people of God, we speak

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:27.519
about the peace of God, and I'm so thankful for the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:31.559
I've often heard people over the years make a statement near the end of their life and

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:35.659
they'll say something like this, if I've asked them if they're sure of heaven, I've made

00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:42.159
my peace with God. Have you ever heard anyone say that, use that terminology? The question

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:47.919
is this, how did you do that? Because biblically speaking, there's only one way to make peace

00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:55.399
with God. Romans 5 and verse number 1, therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with

00:32:55.399 --> 00:33:02.679
God through our Lord Jesus Christ. And here in Colossians 1 and verse number 20, it says,

00:33:02.679 --> 00:33:08.599
and having made peace through the blood of His cross, we were at enmity with God. The

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:13.999
Bible says that God, but God commendeth His love toward us and that while we're yet sinners,

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:19.839
Christ died for us. We were at enmity with God because of our sin nature, because of

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:25.359
the transgression that's recorded in Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve sinned and sin entered

00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:30.319
into the world and death passed upon all men for that all have sinned. And we find that

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:40.139
we were able now, or we are able to have peace with God through the blood of His cross. Wow.

00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:45.579
He mentions about the fact that of this truth in verse number 21, when he says in you that

00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:53.699
were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled.

00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:59.979
So he speaks about this peace and then he speaks about the truth of reconciliation.

00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:06.459
I'm so thankful for this word reconciled, the truth of reconciliation. It's through his

00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:13.139
substitutionary atonement that we can be reconciled to God. You ever had two parties

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:17.619
of people that were at odds at variance one with the other and they need to have a mediator

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:23.179
so that they can be reconciled. Well, we were at enmity with God. We were separated from

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:29.339
God because He is holy and we are sinful. Jesus Christ, through His work on the cross

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:34.419
of Calvary, through the substitutionary atonement, He made it possible that we could be reconciled

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:42.339
to God. It's a precious truth of the word of God. And then we see in verse number 22,

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:46.819
the Bible continues with this idea about the reconciliation, that it was in the body of

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:51.179
His flesh through death. It was through the substitutionary death that we can be reconciled.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:58.499
But notice this last phrase of verse number 22, to present you holy and unblameable and

00:34:58.499 --> 00:35:05.099
unreprovable in His sight. Now think about that truth. The reality is that there in verse

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:10.939
number 22 when He says to present you, we find in verse number 13 it says, who hath

00:35:10.939 --> 00:35:16.259
delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of His

00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:21.619
dear Son. I mentioned the song last Sunday morning. The old account was settled long

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:26.499
ago. I mean, the reality is that the day in which you were saved, you were delivered from

00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:30.659
the power of darkness, and you were translated into the kingdom of His dear Son. It was a

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:36.339
great miracle that took place on that day. And we find that here the Bible reveals to

00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:43.259
us that it was so that, or one of the workings of our salvation is that He would present

00:35:43.259 --> 00:35:51.139
us holy, unblameable, and unreprovable. Now in of ourselves, we're not holy, unblameable,

00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:57.939
and unreprovable. But in as we're clothed in His righteousness, the imputed righteousness

00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:03.379
of Christ that we mention in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 21, and we see here that

00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:09.019
the Bible says that He's done these things, He is the Redeemer, this is the work of redemption,

00:36:09.019 --> 00:36:14.619
and therefore He is going to present us. Think about this truth of our theme for this year.

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:19.579
Complete in Christ. In Colossians 2, in verse number 10, is the verse of Scripture in which

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:24.339
we find that it says, and you are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality

00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:29.619
and power. I don't need anything else. I'm complete in Christ, and because of the work

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:37.219
of redemption, He is going to present you, He's going to present His children holy, unblameable,

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:45.819
and unreprovable. Clothed in His holiness. Unblameable and unreprovable are similar words,

00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:52.059
one meaning without blemish and the other meaning blameless. Now think about that. That's

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:56.299
how He's going to present us. Someone said this, every time that God the Father looks

00:36:56.299 --> 00:37:02.459
at you, He has the son, S-O-N, in His sight. Because we're clothed in the righteousness

00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:07.099
of Christ. And you think about the accuser of the brethren, as the book of Revelation

00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:11.419
would deal with our enemy being the accuser of the brethren, that He would seek to cause

00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:16.779
us to, He'd like to bring up our past and talk about our sin, but we're able to say,

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:24.339
it's under the blood. Julianna sang that song this morning, I am forgiven forever. Not because

00:37:24.339 --> 00:37:29.859
I deserved it, but because God who is rich in mercy, because of His great love wherewith

00:37:29.859 --> 00:37:35.619
He has loved us, because of His work of redemption, He has saved us, He's offered to us the gift

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:41.579
of salvation, and as we receive that free gift of eternal life, He makes it so that

00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:49.299
He is going to present us holy, unblameable, and unreprovable in His sight. It's amazing.

00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:53.699
Remember the truth that God gave to the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the book of

00:37:53.699 --> 00:38:00.379
Psalms, He speaks about the sins being as far removed as the east is from the west.

00:38:00.379 --> 00:38:05.379
That's in Psalm 103 and verse number 12. And it's a great truth, and you understand that

00:38:05.379 --> 00:38:12.499
if you travel east, you can just keep on, there's no point in which east and west are

00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:17.099
really divisible one from the other. We find that He did not say as far as the north is

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:22.179
from the south, but as far as the east is from the west. In Psalm 103 and verse 12,

00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:28.139
as far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:34.299
Aren't you thankful for that? We think about redemption. We think about His work of being

00:38:34.299 --> 00:38:38.899
the Redeemer. Listen, it's a wonderful thing to be forgiven. It's a wonderful thing to

00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:46.859
know that we have been forgiven by the Lord and that we have this forgiveness. There are

00:38:46.859 --> 00:38:54.059
many today that do not know that forgiveness is even available. In Micah 7 and verse number

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:59.379
19, it says, He will turn again, He will have compassion upon us, He will subdue our iniquities,

00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:06.819
and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. We sing a song, gone, gone,

00:39:06.819 --> 00:39:14.819
gone. Yes, my sins are gone. What a great truth. And here we find one of the impacts

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:21.139
or results, if you will, of redemption, that He will present us wholly, unblameable and

00:39:21.139 --> 00:39:24.739
unreprovable in His sight. We'll deal with it as we get through the rest of Colossians

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:29.619
chapter number 1, but let me just give you a quick preview. In verse number 28, and again,

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:33.219
I'm jumping into next week's message, but in verse number 28, the Bible says, Whom we

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:38.099
preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every

00:39:38.099 --> 00:39:43.339
man perfect in Christ Jesus. Why is Paul preaching the gospel? Why are they out doing these missionary

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:48.779
journeys and going and preaching the gospel? Because he understands the power of the gospel

00:39:48.779 --> 00:39:54.299
to transform people, but also that we might be presented wholly and unblameable and unreprovable

00:39:54.299 --> 00:40:01.419
in His sight, and therefore, Paul is preaching that message. What joy to know that he is

00:40:01.419 --> 00:40:03.459
the Redeemer. He's the Redeemer.

00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:06.999
Number four, how Christ is described.

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:09.039
Notice with me that He is the head

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:10.559
of the body, the church.

00:40:10.559 --> 00:40:14.419
In v. 18, the Bible says this,

00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:18.379
and He is the head of the body, the church.

00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:19.459
Who is the beginning,

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:20.799
the firstborn from the dead,

00:40:20.799 --> 00:40:22.919
that in all things He might have

00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:25.099
the preeminence.

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:26.839
As we look at v. 18,

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:28.599
we find that that word head

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:30.919
carries with it the idea of the originator

00:40:30.919 --> 00:40:32.839
or the source.

00:40:32.839 --> 00:40:34.179
It helps us to understand

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:36.259
that He is the leader or the ruler,

00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:40.479
that He is the head of the church.

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:44.019
I'm so thankful that it is His church.

00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:46.939
You know, the church was not man's idea.

00:40:46.939 --> 00:40:49.339
It was God's idea.

00:40:49.339 --> 00:40:50.639
God designed the church.

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:51.979
God empowers the church.

00:40:51.979 --> 00:40:54.259
The Lord Jesus Christ said in Matthew 16

00:40:54.259 --> 00:40:55.179
and v. 18,

00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:56.759
I will build My church

00:40:56.759 --> 00:40:59.299
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:00.799
We find that Paul tells Timothy

00:41:00.799 --> 00:41:02.599
in 1 Timothy 3 and v. 15

00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:05.059
that thou oughtest to know how to obey thyself

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:06.019
in the house of God,

00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:08.859
which is the church of the living God.

00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:10.559
It's God's church.

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:12.559
He's the head of the church.

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:16.099
Oftentimes, we'll speak about the polity,

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.559
if you will, for a local church,

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:20.479
and we'll speak about the office of pastor and deacon

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:22.519
and the role in which I play as the pastor.

00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:24.399
I am the under-shepherd.

00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:26.239
But we have a chief shepherd.

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:28.479
And I'm so thankful that it's His church

00:41:28.479 --> 00:41:31.479
and that He is the head of the church.

00:41:31.479 --> 00:41:34.399
What a joy. What a blessing.

00:41:34.399 --> 00:41:36.739
I want you to think about the ownership

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:39.379
that He has of the church just for a moment

00:41:39.379 --> 00:41:41.159
and this position that He has

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:43.559
as being the head of the body, the church.

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:45.519
Not only is He the originator, the source,

00:41:45.519 --> 00:41:46.919
the leader, and ruler,

00:41:46.919 --> 00:41:49.939
but notice what is said in Acts 20.

00:41:49.939 --> 00:41:54.419
This is just a precious passage of Scripture to me

00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:56.979
as I study through the entirety of this passage.

00:41:56.979 --> 00:41:59.479
It's one in which I find great encouragement.

00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:03.339
I find that Paul is here speaking to these

00:42:03.339 --> 00:42:06.839
Ephesian elders, the leaders of the church at Ephesus,

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:08.799
and he's rehearsing for them

00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:10.579
some of his work in ministry,

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:12.979
and then he's giving them some good counsel

00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:14.839
and instruction with regard to the work

00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:16.199
that is before them.

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:21.279
And it says this in Acts 20, 28,

00:42:21.279 --> 00:42:24.519
"'Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves,

00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:27.239
into all the flock over which the Holy Ghost

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:29.619
hath made you overseers,

00:42:29.619 --> 00:42:33.179
to feed the church of God,

00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:38.039
which He hath purchased with His own blood.'"

00:42:38.039 --> 00:42:39.659
Feed the church of God,

00:42:39.659 --> 00:42:44.119
which He hath purchased with His own blood.

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:47.579
This exalted position of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:49.319
as being the head of the church,

00:42:49.319 --> 00:42:51.239
this was important for these believers

00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:52.719
in Colossae to understand.

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:54.759
Not only was it important for the believers

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.039
in Colossae to understand,

00:42:56.039 --> 00:42:57.639
but it's important for us today

00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:59.799
to continue to understand that Jesus

00:42:59.799 --> 00:43:02.719
is the head of the church.

00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:05.599
And oh, how powerful that truth is.

00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:07.599
And how mindful we must be

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.899
of this reality that is before us.

00:43:10.899 --> 00:43:13.019
This is not my church.

00:43:13.019 --> 00:43:17.939
It's God's church.

00:43:17.939 --> 00:43:20.499
We understand that He is God in flesh.

00:43:20.499 --> 00:43:23.179
Paul in these verses of Scripture

00:43:23.179 --> 00:43:27.339
will present to these believers in Colossae

00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:28.619
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:30.539
The exalted Christ.

00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:33.059
He will give for them the truth

00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:37.559
that He is the image of the invisible God.

00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:39.459
That He is the Creator.

00:43:39.459 --> 00:43:41.199
That He is the Redeemer.

00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:44.399
That He is the head of the body, the church.

00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:46.179
What is Paul saying?

00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:48.139
He's saying that He's God.

00:43:48.139 --> 00:43:50.339
That Jesus is God.

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:52.259
Paul in Acts 17,

00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:56.419
when he arrives in the city of Thessalonica,

00:43:56.419 --> 00:43:58.219
there was a synagogue of the Jews

00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:00.639
and Paul goes to meet with them

00:44:00.639 --> 00:44:02.359
and to give them truth.

00:44:02.359 --> 00:44:05.899
And the Bible tells us in v. 2 of Acts 17,

00:44:05.899 --> 00:44:07.579
and Paul, as his manner was,

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:09.439
went in unto them,

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.779
and three Sabbath days reasoned with them

00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:14.019
out of the Scriptures,

00:44:14.019 --> 00:44:16.779
opening and alleging that Christ's most needs

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:18.199
have suffered,

00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:20.019
and risen again from the dead,

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:23.939
and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:26.899
is Christ.

00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:28.779
They knew who this Jesus was.

00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:31.219
They knew who the man Jesus was.

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:33.099
These individuals, these Jews

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:35.379
that are in the synagogue there in Thessalonica,

00:44:35.379 --> 00:44:38.259
they would have understood who Jesus was as a man.

00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:41.099
They would have understood His crucifixion.

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:42.859
They would have been aware of these things.

00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:47.099
And Paul says this Jesus whom I preach unto you

00:44:47.099 --> 00:44:49.859
is Christ, the Anointed One,

00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:54.019
the Messiah, the Son of God.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:55.739
And here in the book of Colossians,

00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:59.219
he presents Jesus Christ

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:01.059
to these believers.

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:03.019
Now, obviously, they've already understood

00:45:03.019 --> 00:45:04.179
who Jesus Christ was.

00:45:04.179 --> 00:45:06.539
They'd placed their faith and trust in Him

00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:08.539
when they received the Gospel.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.019
But Paul is beginning to...

00:45:10.019 --> 00:45:13.179
You know, we sing the song more about Jesus.

00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:15.099
I hope that you know more about Jesus today

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:17.379
than you did when you first got saved.

00:45:17.379 --> 00:45:18.859
That you understand more of the working

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:22.939
of redemption today than the day you first got saved.

00:45:22.939 --> 00:45:24.979
And so Paul, because of these false teachers

00:45:24.979 --> 00:45:26.899
coming in and saying various things,

00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:28.779
and there are certain people groups

00:45:28.779 --> 00:45:31.059
around the world that they're okay

00:45:31.059 --> 00:45:32.899
if you believe in Jesus as just being

00:45:32.899 --> 00:45:35.099
another small G-O-D.

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.619
They don't mind that you serve

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:38.219
a multiplicity of gods

00:45:38.219 --> 00:45:40.299
and have all of these different deities

00:45:40.299 --> 00:45:42.019
in which you would worship

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:43.979
because they do not mind you

00:45:43.979 --> 00:45:47.859
believing that Jesus existed.

00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:50.819
They're attacking who He really is

00:45:50.819 --> 00:45:53.259
and His work that He completed.

00:45:53.259 --> 00:45:55.659
And so Paul makes this presentation

00:45:55.659 --> 00:45:58.339
to these believers in Colossae.

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:00.179
How do we respond?

00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:01.859
Number two, I've simply said this,

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:04.419
the appropriate response.

00:46:04.419 --> 00:46:06.139
The appropriate response.

00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:07.739
When you read all of these things,

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:09.379
when you receive this great truth

00:46:09.379 --> 00:46:12.379
that Paul reveals to these believers in Colossae,

00:46:12.379 --> 00:46:14.099
when you see the Lord Jesus Christ

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:15.579
exalted in this position,

00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:17.819
when you understand that He is the image

00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:18.979
of the invisible God,

00:46:18.979 --> 00:46:20.179
that He is the Creator,

00:46:20.179 --> 00:46:21.219
He is the Redeemer,

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:23.539
He is the head of the body of the church,

00:46:23.539 --> 00:46:24.819
what's the proper response?

00:46:24.819 --> 00:46:27.979
Well, notice in verse 18.

00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:30.819
The Bible says this at the end of verse 18.

00:46:30.819 --> 00:46:33.059
That in all things,

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:37.899
He might have the preeminence.

00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:39.339
That in all things,

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:42.459
He might have the preeminence.

00:46:42.459 --> 00:46:45.299
Wouldn't that simply be

00:46:45.299 --> 00:46:47.979
the logical conclusion that we would reach?

00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:50.099
When we understand who He is.

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:51.619
When He's presented in the fashion

00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:53.339
in which He has been.

00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:55.219
And we understand who Jesus is,

00:46:55.219 --> 00:46:57.059
it would only seem logical to me

00:46:57.059 --> 00:46:58.219
that we would say,

00:46:58.219 --> 00:47:00.539
yes, He deserves the preeminence

00:47:00.539 --> 00:47:02.059
in every area of my life.

00:47:02.059 --> 00:47:04.059
That word preeminence is the only place

00:47:04.059 --> 00:47:05.979
in the New Testament in which it's found.

00:47:05.979 --> 00:47:07.579
And that word means to be first

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:10.819
or to hold the first place.

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:13.459
Doesn't He deserve that position?

00:47:13.499 --> 00:47:16.019
Isn't our appropriate response

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.859
to the truth that is before us this morning

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:22.539
to say it's all about Jesus?

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:23.579
It should be this,

00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:25.379
that we say like John the Baptist said

00:47:25.379 --> 00:47:27.219
in John 3 and verse 30,

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:31.979
He must increase, I must decrease.

00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:33.579
That in all things,

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:38.139
He might have the preeminence.

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:41.859
Oh, that we would live our lives in that fashion.

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:43.059
It's not about what I want,

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:45.019
it's about what God wants.

00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:47.019
Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 6

00:47:47.019 --> 00:47:48.139
and verses 19 and 20.

00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:49.059
What?

00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:51.419
Know ye not?

00:47:51.419 --> 00:47:52.219
Right?

00:47:52.219 --> 00:47:54.259
I think about the way in which

00:47:54.259 --> 00:47:55.859
he starts that passage of Scripture

00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:56.859
as if he's saying,

00:47:56.859 --> 00:47:58.059
are you ignorant to this?

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:00.019
You know not this truth?

00:48:00.019 --> 00:48:00.859
What's this truth?

00:48:00.859 --> 00:48:03.859
That you've been bought with a price.

00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:06.179
Therefore, the natural conclusion

00:48:06.179 --> 00:48:07.579
of being bought with a price

00:48:07.579 --> 00:48:09.059
is that you're to glorify God

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:10.259
in your body and your spirit,

00:48:10.259 --> 00:48:11.739
which are His.

00:48:11.739 --> 00:48:13.619
He owns us.

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:15.339
When we understand that without Him

00:48:15.339 --> 00:48:16.339
we can do nothing,

00:48:16.339 --> 00:48:18.299
when we understand that He has done for us

00:48:18.299 --> 00:48:20.899
what I could not do for myself

00:48:20.899 --> 00:48:22.779
and what no one else could do for me,

00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:24.619
that I say, yes,

00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:26.379
I want to give Him the preeminence.

00:48:26.379 --> 00:48:30.059
I want to crown Him Lord of lords

00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:31.419
in my life.

00:48:31.419 --> 00:48:34.179
See, the reality is that He is Lord.

00:48:34.179 --> 00:48:36.219
He is King.

00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:37.379
There are times in which

00:48:37.379 --> 00:48:39.099
in our lives individually,

00:48:39.139 --> 00:48:43.019
He may not be the Lord and King of my life.

00:48:43.019 --> 00:48:45.379
Who sits upon that throne

00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:49.059
of your heart, of your life?

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:53.699
You know who wants to sit on that throne is self.

00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:55.499
And it's a constant battle.

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:56.659
That's why Paul said,

00:48:56.659 --> 00:48:59.579
I am crucified with Christ.

00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:00.859
Because the constant battle

00:49:00.859 --> 00:49:05.059
is that self wants to be first.

00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:06.499
I think it was D.L. Moody that said

00:49:06.499 --> 00:49:08.459
if He is not Lord of all,

00:49:08.459 --> 00:49:11.379
He is not Lord at all.

00:49:11.379 --> 00:49:13.459
What powerful statement

00:49:13.459 --> 00:49:17.779
that old preacher of yesteryear made.

00:49:17.779 --> 00:49:20.019
This morning as we look at this appropriate response,

00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:21.659
we'd say first of all,

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:24.019
that we should crown Him Lord of our lives.

00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:27.619
That He would be the Master in our lives.

00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:30.299
That He would have the preeminence.

00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:31.979
I believe that many times today,

00:49:31.979 --> 00:49:33.739
unfortunately, there are people

00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:34.979
that are looking for a Savior,

00:49:34.979 --> 00:49:37.179
but not for a Master.

00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:38.699
What do I mean by that?

00:49:38.699 --> 00:49:40.499
Well, they want somebody to deliver them

00:49:40.499 --> 00:49:42.219
from the penalty of sin,

00:49:42.219 --> 00:49:45.859
but they're not interested in that same somebody

00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:48.899
controlling their life.

00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:50.459
Why? Because I have my ambitions.

00:49:50.459 --> 00:49:51.499
I have my desires.

00:49:51.499 --> 00:49:53.699
I have my...

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:55.659
But we've been bought with a price.

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.059
We're not our own.

00:49:57.059 --> 00:49:59.379
Number two, how we should respond,

00:49:59.379 --> 00:50:00.539
the appropriate response,

00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.379
is that we would continue.

00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:03.739
Notice in verse number 23,

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:10.259
The Bible says this, if you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved

00:50:10.259 --> 00:50:14.479
away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every

00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:18.859
creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a minister."

00:50:18.859 --> 00:50:24.099
When you're speaking about this idea of continuing, you remember as we were studying the passage

00:50:24.099 --> 00:50:29.459
of Scripture with the prayer of Paul, and we talked about the truth in verse number

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:33.899
11, that he said, strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all

00:50:33.899 --> 00:50:37.299
patience and longsuffering, with joyfulness.

00:50:37.299 --> 00:50:41.939
As we looked at that passage of Scripture and we understood the truth that what Paul

00:50:41.939 --> 00:50:48.419
was giving for these believers to understand that what was produced was that spiritual

00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:55.019
maturity, that endurance, that steadfastness, that continuing, if you will, to do the will

00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:56.019
of God.

00:50:56.019 --> 00:51:01.339
And we see here in verse number 23 that he says, if you continue in the faith, grounded

00:51:01.339 --> 00:51:07.379
and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and

00:51:07.379 --> 00:51:10.459
which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made

00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:11.459
a minister.

00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:15.899
So notice with me and consider with me the danger that is present that they would be

00:51:15.899 --> 00:51:16.979
moved away.

00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:19.619
How are they going to be moved away?

00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:21.739
False teachers.

00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:22.739
False teachers.

00:51:23.459 --> 00:51:29.059
Now, we'd understand here that he says that you would continue in the faith grounded and

00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:30.059
settled.

00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:35.779
Again, we see the importance, the significance of discipleship and spiritual maturity through

00:51:35.779 --> 00:51:38.499
this phraseology of being grounded and settled.

00:51:38.499 --> 00:51:43.459
I would say this, that if we're grounded and settled, it will go a long way to keep us

00:51:43.459 --> 00:51:46.659
from being moved away.

00:51:46.659 --> 00:51:48.859
Because we're grounded and settled.

00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:56.899
Listen, I hope that no one could come to you and say that you could get to heaven by your

00:51:56.899 --> 00:51:58.779
own works.

00:51:58.779 --> 00:52:04.699
I hope that you're grounded and settled enough to know that's a false teaching.

00:52:04.699 --> 00:52:06.059
And here's why that's a false teaching.

00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:08.419
You have some verses that you can go to.

00:52:08.419 --> 00:52:11.519
And you can say, well, the Bible says this, and here's a passage of Scripture that deals

00:52:11.519 --> 00:52:12.519
with this.

00:52:12.519 --> 00:52:16.899
It's not of our own works, not of the works of our own righteousness that we have done.

00:52:16.899 --> 00:52:18.499
We're not clothed in our righteousness.

00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:21.379
We're clothed in the righteousness of Christ.

00:52:21.379 --> 00:52:25.579
The Bible says that it's a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:30.299
Just to use one example, if we're grounded and settled, it will go a long way to keep

00:52:30.299 --> 00:52:32.859
us from being moved away.

00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:38.139
You know, the believers in the region of Galatia, as Paul is ministering to those believers

00:52:38.139 --> 00:52:42.099
in Galatians chapter number one, of course, we know that it's a number of churches there

00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:47.439
in Galatia, a church in Antioch and Pisidia and Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:50.039
And it says in verse number two, that the church is in Galatia.

00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:54.019
But notice with me, the Bible says this in verse number six.

00:52:54.019 --> 00:52:56.519
He says in Galatians 1 verse number six,

00:52:56.519 --> 00:53:03.559
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ

00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:06.339
unto another gospel.

00:53:06.339 --> 00:53:11.559
And then he says this, which is not another, but there be some that trouble you and would

00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:14.879
pervert the gospel of Christ.

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:19.639
But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you that, that which

00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:25.999
we have preached unto you, let him be accursed, strong language.

00:53:25.999 --> 00:53:29.859
But what happened in these churches in Galatia, there are some false teachers there, the Judaizers

00:53:29.859 --> 00:53:34.599
in particular, and those false teachers were teaching something other.

00:53:34.599 --> 00:53:39.679
And Paul says, I am, I marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into

00:53:39.679 --> 00:53:41.879
the grace of Christ unto another gospel.

00:53:41.879 --> 00:53:45.339
Notice that phraseology, that they were so soon removed.

00:53:45.339 --> 00:53:47.239
What does he say in Colossians 1?

00:53:47.239 --> 00:53:55.159
He says this, if you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away.

00:53:55.159 --> 00:53:57.319
Now let me say this.

00:53:57.319 --> 00:54:03.359
These people in Colossae that are being written to in Colossians in this book, they are referred

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:09.079
to in verse number two as the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, which are at Colossae.

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.539
They're saved people.

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:12.219
We believe in eternal security.

00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:14.459
We are kept by the power of God.

00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:19.699
Jesus said in John chapter number 10, that my sheep hear my voice and I know them and

00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:23.779
I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish.

00:54:23.779 --> 00:54:27.899
I'm so thankful for the truth of eternal security.

00:54:27.899 --> 00:54:33.579
Here in verse number 23, he's not teaching that they would lose their salvation.

00:54:33.579 --> 00:54:37.419
If they've been saved, they are secure in Christ.

00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:38.419
So what is he teaching?

00:54:38.419 --> 00:54:39.419
What are the false teachers?

00:54:39.419 --> 00:54:45.660
Why do the false teachers come after saved people if they can't cause you to be lost?

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.579
Because they can attack your effectiveness.

00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:53.759
You think about the work of a false teacher, bringing in confusion and chaos and all sorts

00:54:53.759 --> 00:54:54.759
of things.

00:54:54.759 --> 00:54:58.819
And it begins that you're not going to continue to preach the same message that you receive

00:54:58.819 --> 00:55:02.979
because you're so messed up and you're so confused about what the real truth is.

00:55:02.979 --> 00:55:08.259
And now what's happening is your effectiveness on reaching other people with that powerful

00:55:08.259 --> 00:55:13.819
gospel that's able to save souls, your effectiveness is hindered.

00:55:13.819 --> 00:55:17.459
If you don't know the truth of eternal security, how are you going to help somebody with eternal

00:55:17.459 --> 00:55:19.259
security?

00:55:19.259 --> 00:55:24.380
If you don't know the truth that Jesus is the only Savior, that Jesus Christ himself

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:29.459
said, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:33.699
If Peter stood with great power and said, neither is there salvation in any other for

00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:37.579
there's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:42.139
If we don't know those truths, because some false teachers have gotten us all kinds of

00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:47.619
sideways and we've been moved away, I'm still secure in Christ, but my effectiveness on

00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:51.579
reaching the world with the gospel is greatly hindered.

00:55:51.579 --> 00:55:57.380
And that's what the false teacher wants to do.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.859
He wants to keep people from being saved.

00:56:00.859 --> 00:56:07.660
And so the attack upon the church that the enemy brings on introducing false teaching,

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:14.459
these men that are referenced in Jude, verse number 3 and 4, that had crept in unawares,

00:56:14.459 --> 00:56:19.539
that turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

00:56:19.539 --> 00:56:23.500
Jude says, it was needful that I write unto you.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.500
It was necessary.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.299
It was of utmost importance.

00:56:26.299 --> 00:56:27.299
Why?

00:56:27.299 --> 00:56:28.859
Because these false teachers are coming in.

00:56:28.859 --> 00:56:33.339
I'm thankful for my security in Christ, but I want to continue in this and I want to be

00:56:33.339 --> 00:56:34.339
grounded and settled.

00:56:34.339 --> 00:56:38.579
And it's not the idea that if I get all kinds of sideways because of a false teacher that

00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:39.579
I'm going to lose my salvation.

00:56:39.579 --> 00:56:46.380
No, but I'm going to lose my effectiveness.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:52.299
There's a lot of people today in our world that kind of carry that idea, you just be

00:56:52.299 --> 00:56:56.899
sincere about what you believe and at the end everything's going to be okay.

00:56:56.899 --> 00:57:01.179
Just sincerely embrace and believe what you believe.

00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:02.739
All roads lead to heaven.

00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:05.380
I've heard it so many times.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.660
It's just not true.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.660
It's just not true.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.779
But the false teachers, the enemy, right?

00:57:13.779 --> 00:57:17.419
The God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light

00:57:17.419 --> 00:57:21.459
of the glorious gospel should shine unto them, according to 2 Corinthians, chapter number

00:57:21.459 --> 00:57:22.459
4.

00:57:22.459 --> 00:57:27.099
And so we find that these false teachers, they're going to continue to attack and to

00:57:27.099 --> 00:57:29.139
continue to try to tear down.

00:57:29.139 --> 00:57:36.099
And when you or when I stand up and I say, Jesus is the only way, oh man, they don't

00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:37.099
like that.

00:57:37.099 --> 00:57:39.339
They don't like that.

00:57:39.339 --> 00:57:43.059
In fact, I preached a message several years ago about that very subject, Jesus is the

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.019
only way.

00:57:45.019 --> 00:57:52.059
There was a large, large church, a Baptist church, unfortunately, in New York City.

00:57:52.059 --> 00:57:57.579
The pastor stood up and he preached a message, and in his message, he said, this thinking

00:57:57.579 --> 00:58:03.339
that Jesus is the only way is outdated, and it's just not true, and you can't support

00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:05.459
it biblically.

00:58:05.459 --> 00:58:12.139
And when he made that statement in a church of 10 or 15,000 people, you could hear in

00:58:12.139 --> 00:58:20.099
the background applause and hooting and hollering at the support of the statement that was made.

00:58:20.139 --> 00:58:22.660
How sad.

00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:26.539
People are being, listen, they're condemned already.

00:58:26.539 --> 00:58:33.479
And if we would, if the false teachers get their way and they subvert and they come in

00:58:33.479 --> 00:58:39.979
and they undermine the truth of the Word of God, then we find that people will continue

00:58:39.979 --> 00:58:43.119
to be lost in their sins.

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:46.899
And so Paul says, let me exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:49.099
Let me help you.

00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:54.820
Let me remind you, and let me help you understand that He is the image of the invisible God.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.179
He's the Creator.

00:58:56.179 --> 00:58:57.479
He's the Redeemer.

00:58:57.479 --> 00:58:59.760
He's the head of the body of the church.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:05.500
And here's your appropriate response to such truth, that you would crown Him Lord and King

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.700
of your life, that in all things He would have the preeminence, and that you would continue.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:14.059
Don't be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:17.099
No, be grounded and settled.

00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:22.700
You understand this morning that the right way is not always the popular way.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:27.539
I'd still rather be right with just a few people than be wrong with the multitudes.

00:59:27.539 --> 00:59:28.539
Amen.

00:59:28.539 --> 00:59:29.539
Let's pray.

00:59:29.539 --> 00:59:30.539
Father, we love You.

00:59:30.539 --> 00:59:32.059
We thank You for loving us.

00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:34.739
We thank You for this passage of Scripture.

00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:41.179
What great truth that You give us in Your Word.

00:59:41.179 --> 00:59:44.500
We thank You for our Savior.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.659
We thank You for who He is, God in flesh.

00:59:47.659 --> 00:59:48.820
We thank You for what He has done.

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:55.299
We thank You for the redeeming work at Calvary, His substitutionary atonement, His death,

00:59:55.299 --> 00:59:57.820
burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:03.140
I pray this morning that You would help Your people.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.779
We know this is Your church.

01:00:03.779 --> 01:00:12.219
church, God help us to be grounded and settled. Help us Lord to stand for truth,

01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:18.699
to contend for the faith. I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:23.939
maybe they've been influenced by some false teachers, some false doctrine, maybe

01:00:23.939 --> 01:00:31.099
they've been told that there's some other way to get to heaven. I pray that

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:34.499
this morning the truth of your word, the Holy Spirit would take it and minister as

01:00:34.499 --> 01:00:39.299
only he can. Would you be exalted in our midst during these few moments of

01:00:39.299 --> 01:00:42.859
invitation? We'll thank you for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we

01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:46.659
pray. Would you stand with me? Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. We will

01:00:46.659 --> 01:00:52.139
have a moment of invitation here and I encourage you at home to allow the Lord

01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:55.299
to have his way in your life as you consider these truths from the Word of

01:00:55.299 --> 01:01:00.379
God. As Kimberly plays we'll have a moment of invitation.
