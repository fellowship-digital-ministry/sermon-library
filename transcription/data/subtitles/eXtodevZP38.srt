1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,079
with the thought the real theme of the series being the Lord is my

2
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:08,680
dot dot dot was kind of the the series for about 15 weeks or so on Wednesday

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,399
evenings

4
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:13,479
and we dealt with the fact that about six weeks ago the Lord is my exceeding

5
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,159
joy

6
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:18,200
and after that message Miss Lorraine came to me and said do you know the song

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,520
the Lord is my exceeding joy and I said I didn't know there was a song

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,479
the Lord is my exceeding joy and so she sang a little bit of it to me back there

9
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,719
after the service on that Wednesday evening

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,639
and I'm thankful that you're able to sing the entirety of it this morning

11
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,959
certainly a blessing

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,720
and I said this during that message about six weeks ago listen there are a

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,720
lot of things that people try to find joy and happiness in in this world

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,400
and but when we understand that Jesus

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
is my joy he is my exceeding joy listen he never changes he's the same yesterday

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,520
and today and forever

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,840
and we have circumstances that change you get new things that get old and they

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,720
break and they wear down and

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,479
whatever it might be but the reality is that if he is my joy then I am able to

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,040
have he said that my joy might remain in you

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,839
and that your joy might be full as I read that verse from John 15

22
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,919
and what a tremendous blessing thank you for that song

23
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,800
this morning the book of second Kings this morning second Kings chapter number

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,480
five

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,360
second Kings chapter number five and

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
a couple of weeks ago we dealt with the subject matter of the proclamation

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,040
of Jethro and then last week we dealt with the proclamation of Rahab this

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,760
morning

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,519
we're gonna deal with address the subject matter of the proclamation of

30
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,639
Naaman here from second Kings chapter number five let me say this by way of

31
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,400
introduction I am thankful

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,319
to live in a country where the gospel has been faithfully proclaimed

33
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,480
and the reality is that the United States of America is a place in which

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
the gospel has been

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,800
readily available that it has been preached and it's been

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,559
delivered from one generation to another it does not mean that everyone within

37
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:05,160
our nation has heard the gospel or that everyone within our nation is saved we

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
know that not to be the case

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,160
but I'm thankful to be in a land where the gospel is known

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,039
I'm thankful to be in a land today we're still today

41
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,080
we can go we have the freedom to be able to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus

42
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,919
Christ to those

43
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,160
that we would come into contact with and that is a tremendous blessing you know

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,679
there are places around the globe today

45
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:33,479
that people have never one time heard the name of Jesus

46
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,399
the gospel is not declared in a number of those lands around the globe today

47
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:44,080
then you can look at some lands today where there are some believers there

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,559
some Christians

49
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:49,759
but they do not have the freedom to faithfully

50
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,600
and freely share the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,000
just openly with those that they come into contact with

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,600
they face great danger they face great levels of persecution

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,360
and we understand this morning that we have a mandate from the Lord a command

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,279
from the Lord

55
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,720
to make him known to preach the gospel to every creature

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,960
now whether we have the freedom from a government to do that or not

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,039
doesn't really change the command that we've been given

58
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,800
but I would say this living in a place where we understand the command that God

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,639
has given

60
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,160
but also coupled with the fact that we have the freedom to proclaim it

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,240
we better take advantage of that and we better be careful

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,639
and be diligent to be able to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ

63
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,119
as we come to second Kings chapter number five were introduced to a man by

64
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,240
the name of Naaman

65
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:46,639
thus the title of the message the proclamation of Naaman

66
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,279
but were introduced to a man by the name of Naaman who's Assyrian

67
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:55,479
and he does not as we look at the passage of scripture he does not know

68
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,919
Jehovah God he does not know the God of the Bible

69
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,479
and at the onset of this passage of scripture

70
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,399
and I'm thankful that though he was in a situation in a land where he did not

71
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,119
know

72
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:12,960
the Lord that through some very divine circumstances God

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,000
allowed for this man to know

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,320
who he is I'm thankful this morning that God

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,359
wants to make himself known to his creation

76
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:26,799
God wants to make himself known to mankind

77
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,799
God is a loving God he

78
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:35,720
died for the sins of the world and he desires to make himself known

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,760
and I'm thankful that as we look at this passage of scripture

80
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:43,079
that this man Naaman will understand who God is notice with me

81
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,160
as we begin reading in second Kings chapter number five

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,200
and as we're introduced to this man notice how he is described the Bible

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,279
says in verse number one now Naaman

84
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,119
captain of the host of the king of Syria

85
00:04:56,119 --> 00:05:00,000
was a great man with his master an honorable

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,359
because by him the Lord had given deliverance into Syria

87
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:08,559
he was also a mighty man in valor

88
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,799
but he was a leper he was a leper

89
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:15,799
we look at the description that is provided to us in verse number one

90
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,799
we see that he's described as being the captain of the host of the king of Syria

91
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,799
a great man with his master the Bible says that he's

92
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,920
honorable the Bible tells us that he's a mighty man in valor

93
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,480
the Bible tells us that he is a leper though the Bible does not say this in

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,679
verse number one I believe it would be accurate for us to be able to say

95
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,640
that he did not know the Lord he did not know the Lord

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,839
we find as we look at this passage of scripture we see what's taking place we

97
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,359
find that in verse number two

98
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:50,880
God introduces to us and reveals to us some circumstances that had transpired

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,440
that God was going to use for his honor for his glory notice in verse number two

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,920
the Bible says that the Syrians had gone out by companies

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,679
and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel

102
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,200
a little maid and she this little maid this servant girl this

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,799
captive the Bible says that she waited

104
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:17,359
on Naaman's wife now as we look at just that statement

105
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:21,399
before we get into the interaction that God gives us here between Naaman and

106
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,239
Elisha

107
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:26,320
I believe that it's important that we recognize a few important truths as we

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,040
look at this verse of scripture

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,559
and see what this little maid this little servant girl this

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,600
little Israeli what she says

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,200
to her master to Naaman's wife

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,720
the Bible says in verse number three that she said unto her mistress

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,279
would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria now she's speaking

114
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,519
of Naaman and she says would God

115
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,600
that Naaman were with the prophet that is in Samaria that's

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,760
Elisha and notice what the Bible says

117
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,359
the Bible says that he Elisha would recover him

118
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:07,320
of his leprosy as we look at this text of scripture were introduced here to

119
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,720
this

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,679
little servant girl this little maid she's

121
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,880
unnamed but we find that God would use her in a great way

122
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,920
as we look at the circumstances surrounding

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,440
this little maid ending up in the home of

124
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,000
Naaman we could look at it from the perspective of saying these are

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,399
unfortunate circumstances the Bible tells us that the Syrians had gone out

126
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,480
by companies

127
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,760
and they brought away captive out of the land of Israel

128
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,559
and this little maid came back as a captive

129
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:41,000
because of this military conquest that took place

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,640
and if you were the parents of that little girl you would probably be

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
disappointed

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,119
you would have heart that would be heavy

133
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:52,760
and you would look at that circumstance and we could look at it as being this is

134
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,839
unfortunate

135
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,559
but I want you to understand this morning that our God is sovereign

136
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:01,519
I want you to understand this morning that our God has a plan

137
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,040
and I'm thankful that God always has a plan

138
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,519
and I'm thankful this morning that as we consider the character in the nature in

139
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,279
the attributes of our God

140
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,600
that our God is a God who is gracious

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,720
our God is a God who is merciful and he allows this little maid this little girl

142
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,320
to be to be taken captive

143
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,440
and to end up a servant to Naaman's

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,359
wife. Naaman we've already been introduced in verse number one

145
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:37,880
with regard to the the description that is provided to us but the Bible

146
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,080
ends and says that he was a leper

147
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,640
at the end of verse number one and it's because of this

148
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,280
this disease this health concern

149
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,599
that this little maid after some period of time as she experiences and

150
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,159
understands what's taking place

151
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,919
the Bible says that this little maid she makes this statement in verse number

152
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,479
three as she's speaking to Naaman's wife

153
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:06,520
she says would God my Lord were with the prophet

154
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,599
that is in Samaria for he would recover him

155
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,599
of his leprosy. She was so convincing

156
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,159
as she spoke to the wife of Naaman

157
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,919
that we find that action takes place immediately

158
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,880
after she makes this known it says that one went in in verse number four

159
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,239
and told his Lord saying thus and thus said the maid

160
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:32,880
that is of the land of Israel. Now can you imagine how God would use this little

161
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,679
maid we don't know her name we don't know anything about her

162
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,479
but we know that she was faithful to stand up and speak up for the Lord

163
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,479
Amen. She's a

164
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:47,440
servant. Someone could easily say to her hey

165
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,919
hey no one asked you to speak right

166
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,960
but she stood up and she spoke up and

167
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,000
she speaks about the situation she had confidence

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,080
I believe not only in Elisha but in the God

169
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,540
God of Elisha.

170
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,780
As you begin to think about the miracles of Elijah

171
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,220
and the miracles of Elisha,

172
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,500
we understand that God would use those men

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,180
in miraculous ways just as he used so many of God's people,

174
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,220
just as he would continue to use us even today,

175
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,460
but it's God who does the work.

176
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,500
When we think about the miracles of Elijah,

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
when we think about the miracles of Elisha,

178
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,280
that's God's power being displayed

179
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,740
and he's using those individuals.

180
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,380
As we look here and we find that the servant comes in

181
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,800
and says to his master,

182
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,120
thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.

183
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,880
And notice now the Bible says that the king of Syria

184
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
gets involved in verse number five,

185
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,760
and it says, and the king of Syria said, go to go.

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,120
And I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.

187
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,680
And he departed and took with him 10 talents of silver

188
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,980
and 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of raiment.

189
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,480
I mean, a large sum of money,

190
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,840
really a gift, if you will, a reward.

191
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,600
And he sends this and he sends this letter.

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,760
So the king of Syria, hearing all that has transpired

193
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,920
and understanding the place of Naaman,

194
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,080
he writes this letter to the king of Israel

195
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,920
and the king of Israel receives the letter.

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,700
Now he's not so excited about the letter that he receives

197
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,440
for the Bible tells us in verse number six,

198
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying,

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,520
now, when this letter has come unto thee,

200
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,940
behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee,

201
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,800
that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,700
Now there's no way that the king of Israel

203
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,820
is going to even begin to know

204
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,180
how he might be able to do something like this.

205
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,300
The Bible says that as receiving this letter

206
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,740
in verse number seven, it came to pass

207
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,640
when the king of Israel had read the letter

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,380
that he rent his clothes and said,

209
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,920
am I God to kill and to make alive

210
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,460
that this man doth send unto me

211
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,880
to recover a man of his leprosy?

212
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,020
Wherefore, consider, I pray you,

213
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,220
and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

214
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,980
The king of Israel is beside himself.

215
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,020
He doesn't know what to do with the circumstances

216
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,640
that are unfolding, and he says,

217
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
what am I supposed to do about this?

218
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,580
And we find that Elisha, according to verse number eight,

219
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,980
he hears about what has taken place.

220
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,140
The king of Israel is overwhelmed.

221
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,600
Elisha is informed, he's understanding what's taking place.

222
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,940
It says in verse number eight, and it was so,

223
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,800
when Elisha, the man of God,

224
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,960
had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes,

225
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,040
that he sent to the king saying,

226
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,980
wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?

227
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,200
Now, notice what Elisha says.

228
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,080
Let him, speaking of Naaman, come now to me,

229
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,080
and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

230
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,760
Now, I want you to understand this morning

231
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,480
that not only would Naaman know

232
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
that there's a prophet in Israel,

233
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,340
but most importantly, he would know God.

234
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,660
And as we look at the portion of scripture,

235
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,460
as we see what's taking place,

236
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,860
and we've mentioned as we've studied this year

237
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,200
dealing with how great our God is,

238
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,420
and man, we sang some wonderful songs this morning,

239
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,620
our great savior, and what a great savior he is,

240
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,140
and how great thou art,

241
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,480
and thinking about the plan that God has,

242
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,440
and rejoicing in the fact of his creation,

243
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,540
and seeing his greatness,

244
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,860
and then understanding his plan of redemption,

245
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,220
and his greatness that is revealed therein,

246
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,580
and then understanding as we sing that fourth verse

247
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,620
of how great thou art,

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,980
that one day he's coming back,

249
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,140
and oh, how great our God is,

250
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,700
but we understand this morning

251
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,860
that even as we recognize how great he is,

252
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,420
we must declare how great he is,

253
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,900
and we see this proclamation on the part of Naaman,

254
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,180
and notice with me if you're taking notes this morning,

255
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,080
number one is we've gotten into the interaction,

256
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,060
but now between Naaman and Elisha,

257
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,020
I want you to notice with me number one,

258
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,020
consider what Naaman expected, what he expected.

259
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Everyone has expectations, everyone has expectations.

260
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,520
You go out to eat somewhere,

261
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,500
you have an expectation as to what you're gonna receive.

262
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,520
You go have a meeting with someone,

263
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,960
you have an expectation, you just have expectations.

264
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,380
I often say to my children,

265
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,020
and to those that I have opportunity

266
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
to have influence in that we should manage expectations,

267
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,940
that we should communicate with people

268
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,400
so that we could manage their expectations, why?

269
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,680
Because if they come in with high expectations

270
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,500
and they're not realized,

271
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,940
then people can be greatly disappointed,

272
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,300
and we find that people have expectations in life,

273
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,740
and we find that as we look at this text of scripture

274
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,940
that Naaman, he expected something to happen

275
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,100
as he entered into, now remember,

276
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,020
why he's going to Elisha in the first place.

277
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,160
He's going to Elisha in the first place

278
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,100
because the little servant, the little maid

279
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,260
that was waiting on his wife

280
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,940
that had been taken captive from Israel,

281
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,220
she says, would to God my Lord,

282
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,780
remember we read it already,

283
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,020
was with the prophet that is in Samaria, why?

284
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,620
For he would recover him of his leprosy.

285
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,180
And so he goes expecting to be recovered of his leprosy,

286
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,340
but really his expectation is revealed to us

287
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,760
as we look at the text of scripture,

288
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,020
but notice how the interaction begins.

289
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,420
In verse number nine, the Bible says,

290
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,340
so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,

291
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,860
and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

292
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,880
Now, I hope this morning in your mind's eye

293
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,060
that you can see the picture of this unfolding,

294
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,540
this leper, this man from Syria that's heard this message,

295
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,700
he's been convinced based upon what the little maid says,

296
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,220
and the king of Syria sends a letter

297
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,100
to the king of Israel, Elisha says,

298
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,980
let him come to me and don't be troubled,

299
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,340
let him come to me, and we find that now this man,

300
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,780
he's there, Naaman, the Bible says,

301
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,020
with his horses and with his chariot,

302
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,380
and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

303
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,820
Now, right from the beginning,

304
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,520
if you go to somebody's house

305
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,740
and you know that it's the person

306
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,000
that you're looking to have an interaction with,

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
what do you expect?

308
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Expect they're gonna come and answer the door.

309
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,180
Right, I mean, it'd be kind of an easy level of expectation,

310
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,040
but we find that in the text of scripture,

311
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,880
the Bible tells us in verse number 10

312
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,720
that Elisha sent a messenger, he sent a messenger.

313
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Now, Naaman's traveled, he's come to this place,

314
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,240
he's heard what the little maid said,

315
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,720
and he's convinced, and he comes,

316
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,680
and Elisha even said to the king,

317
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,000
let him come, that he would know

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
that there's a prophet in Israel,

319
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,920
and now as Naaman is standing there

320
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,800
before the house of Elisha, he's at the right place.

321
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,080
He's not at the wrong house, he's not at the wrong address,

322
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,680
he wasn't given bad directions, he's at the right place.

323
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
And Elisha sends a messenger.

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,800
And here's what Elisha says to that messenger.

325
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,120
The messenger comes with a simple set of instructions.

326
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
Notice in verse number 10.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Go and wash in Jordan seven times,

328
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,880
and thy flesh shall come again to thee,

329
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
and thou shalt be clean.

330
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
That's not complicated, is it?

331
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,320
That's pretty straightforward.

332
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,640
I mean, a very simple set of instructions.

333
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
He tells him where to go, to the Jordan,

334
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,920
it's a specific place, he would know where that place is.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,560
We find that he tells him to dip in the Jordan,

336
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,800
to wash in the Jordan, seven times.

337
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
There's a specific number of times.

338
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,200
He doesn't just, it's not instruction

339
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,320
that is like some of the manuals that you read today,

340
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,520
and you're saying, I don't know,

341
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,960
like, should I turn this a different way?

342
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,200
It doesn't make any sense.

343
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,040
No, no, go to a specific place, wash seven times,

344
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,200
and here's what the result will be.

345
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,040
Thou, notice it says, thy flesh shall come again to thee,

346
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,000
and thou shalt be clean.

347
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,560
This is not what Naaman expected.

348
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,480
Not for one second is this what Naaman expected.

349
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,760
Naaman, in fact, is angry.

350
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,800
The Bible describes it this way, that he was wroth.

351
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,360
In verse number 11, the Bible says,

352
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
but Naaman was wroth and went away.

353
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,720
Notice what he says, behold, I thought.

354
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
Now, here's where the text of Scripture

355
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,320
reveals to us what he, Naaman, expected to happen.

356
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,080
In verse number 11, he begins to share

357
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
with those servants that are there with him

358
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,679
after he hears what the messenger from Elisha says.

359
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,200
He says, here's what I thought was going to happen.

360
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,520
He, who's he speaking of?

361
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,720
He's speaking of Elisha.

362
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,720
He, Elisha the prophet, he will surely come out to me

363
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,320
and stand and call on the name of the Lord, his God,

364
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,000
and strike his hand over a place and recover the leper.

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,640
So he expected that there's gonna be some show.

366
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,280
I mean, there's gonna be, Elisha's gonna come out

367
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,040
and he's gonna raise up his hands

368
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,440
and he's gonna call on the Lord, his God,

369
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,920
and he's gonna strike his hand and bam,

370
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,960
he's gonna be healed of his leprosy.

371
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,000
I mean, that's what he's expecting.

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,840
Now, I could understand why he'd have that expectation.

373
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,119
I could understand why Naaman coming to the house of Elisha

374
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,320
would have this expectation of how this would play out.

375
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,559
I mean, can you imagine being a leper?

376
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,640
Can you imagine being in that situation?

377
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,920
The Bible doesn't tell us,

378
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,280
but I think about the position of Naaman.

379
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,720
I think that they probably did everything they could do

380
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
in order to deal with this issue of leprosy

381
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
with zero success.

382
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,239
Do you remember the woman in the gospel accounts

383
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,340
that had the issue of blood for 12 years?

384
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,480
The Bible says that she spent everything,

385
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,400
she tried everything by going to the medical professions

386
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,840
to be healed with no help whatsoever.

387
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,239
And she said, if I could just touch the hem of his garment.

388
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:05,199
And Jesus says, who touched me?

389
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,759
Who touched me?

390
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,719
And when she touched the hem of his garment, what happened immediately?

391
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,719
She was healed.

392
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,479
She was made whole.

393
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:20,479
Naaman had some expectation and I think that he's probably done everything.

394
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:25,439
Remember he's the captain of the host and remember that as we look at what's taking

395
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:30,719
place, I mean the king of Syria writes a letter on his behalf.

396
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:37,799
No doubt all of the remedies and all of the things have been exhausted that they could

397
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,559
do and he has this expectation that the man of God, Elisha, he's going to come out and

398
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,079
he says, here's what I thought, but he's angry.

399
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,079
Why?

400
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,199
Because it doesn't happen like he says.

401
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,599
He continues and he says this in verse number 12.

402
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:56,359
He says, are not Abana and Farfar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?

403
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,039
May I not wash in them and be clean?

404
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,239
So he turned and went away in a rage.

405
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,079
Instructions were not complicated.

406
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,079
Very simple instructions.

407
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,239
He begins to lean on his own understanding.

408
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:16,039
He says, we've got rivers back in Syria that are better than this river.

409
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,839
The Jordan, I'm going to dip in that water?

410
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:27,119
We've got cleaner, better waters that I could dip in and be clean if that's all it is.

411
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,119
I mean can you see?

412
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,199
I mean he's angry.

413
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:33,399
The Bible says that he's in a rage at the end of verse number 12.

414
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:37,959
He's angry over what's taking place, but we notice, we consider in the text of Scripture

415
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:42,499
as this interaction unfolds for us, we consider first of all what Naaman expected.

416
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:46,899
Number two, if you're taking notes, I want you to consider with me what Naaman experienced.

417
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:49,379
Notice what he experienced.

418
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,379
He's ready to leave.

419
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:51,379
He's wroth.

420
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:55,859
He's in a rage, but there's a servant that comes to him in verse number three and I'm

421
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:58,779
thankful for the plea of this servant.

422
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,979
The servant pleads with his master and it says in verse 13 that his servants came near

423
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:10,259
and spake unto him and said, my father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,

424
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,139
wouldst thou not have done it?

425
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:20,819
So he's pleading with Naaman and he's saying if the instruction were to do some great thing,

426
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,019
you would have followed it.

427
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,619
You would have done it.

428
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:31,139
And he says at the end of verse number 13, how much rather then when he saith to thee,

429
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:35,939
wash and be clean.

430
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:41,859
This servant, again, we don't have the name of this individual in verse number 13 who

431
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:50,139
speaks to Naaman, he's pleading with him and he, through some logical explanation, convinces

432
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,639
Naaman to follow the instruction.

433
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,299
So Naaman had to humble himself.

434
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,539
Naaman had to follow the instructions that were provided.

435
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:02,799
He had to stop leaning on his own understanding.

436
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:08,919
He had to submit to the instruction that has been provided.

437
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:21,319
You know how often today people ignore and refuse to obey the simple truth of the gospel?

438
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,959
Because they're leaning on their own understanding.

439
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,679
It's got to be something more to it.

440
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,599
I mean, there's got to be something more I have to do.

441
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,919
I've heard that so many times.

442
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,239
Listen, there's nothing you can do to save yourself.

443
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,639
There's nothing you need to do.

444
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,479
There's nothing that you can do.

445
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:39,959
You can't help God save you.

446
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,319
He did it all.

447
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,879
I'm so thankful for that wonderful Bible truth.

448
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,639
And you know what people have to do?

449
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:48,099
They have to humble themselves.

450
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:52,119
They have to humble themselves that they're going to stop believing whatever it was that

451
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:58,039
they believed beforehand, stop believing that there's some better way, some other way.

452
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,319
They have to submit.

453
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,239
Listen, there was only one way.

454
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:07,439
I would argue until I had no breath left in me that there was only one way for Naaman

455
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:11,379
to be healed of his leprosy.

456
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:14,359
He could have dunked in that Jordan five times.

457
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,999
He's not going to be healed.

458
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,079
He could have decided that he's going to do...

459
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,880
There was one way that Naaman was going to be healed of his leprosy.

460
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Why?

461
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,119
Because the man of God was speaking what God, the Lord, told him to speak.

462
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,239
And I could say to you this morning, and I understand that as we live in this ever-changing

463
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:40,279
culture that it's becoming less and less popular to stand and proclaim that Jesus is the only

464
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:47,239
way, but I tell you based upon the authority of God's precious Word that Jesus is the only

465
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,599
way.

466
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:55,079
There's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

467
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,799
And this morning as we look at this text of Scripture and we see what Naaman experienced,

468
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,759
this servant comes and pleads.

469
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,319
I mean, Naaman's ready to leave.

470
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,319
I can see him.

471
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,039
I mean, he's a man that's in charge.

472
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,699
I mean, he's a leader.

473
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:13,720
He's ready to get everything and leave and go back and he's angry.

474
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,160
And this servant pleads with him and he says, listen, how much rather than when he sayeth

475
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,319
to thee, wash and be clean.

476
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:31,160
And then the Bible says that then, notice verse 14, then went he down and dipped himself

477
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,720
seven times in Jordan.

478
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,759
Notice the next phrase.

479
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:41,440
This is so important for us to understand, according to the saying of the man of God.

480
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:49,959
He humbled himself and he obeyed that which he had been told to do from the man of God.

481
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:55,440
The Bible tells us in verse number 14 that he does this and it says at the end of verse

482
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,839
14, notice what it says, and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child.

483
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,440
And then notice the last phrase, and he was clean.

484
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,359
He was clean.

485
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,519
What an experience.

486
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:18,759
I mean, as I look at the circumstances surrounding this event in 2 Kings chapter 5, as God would

487
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,519
give us the record of this man Naaman and noticing what he expected and his disappointment

488
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:31,639
and his anger and his rage and his plan to depart and how God used a servant back home

489
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:38,239
in Syria to say, would to God my Lord, we're in Israel there with the prophet of God for

490
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:40,239
he would heal him of his leprosy.

491
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:44,119
And then there's another servant that says, listen, why don't you just follow what the

492
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,660
man of God says?

493
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,959
And we find that Naaman humbles himself.

494
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,319
I mean, you see him as he gets down into the Jordan River.

495
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,599
I mean, as he humbles himself and he obeys what the man of God says, he gets down into

496
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,679
the Jordan River and he dips himself one time and he comes back up and there's no change

497
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,399
and he does it a second time and there's no change in number three and number four.

498
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:11,599
And we find that the Bible tells us that as he dips that seventh time again, following

499
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,359
what God said through his servant, Elisha, his flesh came again like the flesh of a little

500
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,440
child and he was clean.

501
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,519
Wow.

502
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,279
What an experience.

503
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:32,880
What an experience that this man had.

504
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,559
And we find that this experience in his life, this event that we read of in verse number

505
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,079
14 had a profound impact upon him.

506
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,959
And it brings us to really the main emphasis of the message this morning, that proclamation

507
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,119
of Naaman number three in your notes.

508
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,079
If you're taking notes, consider with me what Naaman exclaimed.

509
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,599
I mean, he had an expectation and then there's a great experience, but then there's this

510
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,000
exclamation, what he exclaimed.

511
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,039
Notice in verse 14, it talks about him being clean and then it says, and he returned in

512
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,959
verse number 15 to the man of God.

513
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:19,399
He and all his company and came and stood before him.

514
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,599
Now notice with me at this particular time, remember what happens the first time he comes

515
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,880
to the door of Elisha, Elisha doesn't come out.

516
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,640
Elisha sends a messenger with a simple set of instructions.

517
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,880
And we find that they go down to the Jordan River and he dips seven times and he's made

518
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
clean.

519
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,399
And now he and all of his company, they returned to the house of Elisha.

520
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,839
And it seems as you read the text of scripture, it seems as if Elisha is standing there and

521
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:54,959
waiting for him because he gets there and notice what he says.

522
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,559
I don't think he said it quietly.

523
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,359
I don't think he said it sheepishly.

524
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:11,320
He says, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.

525
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,599
Now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant.

526
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,719
So notice with me as we consider what he exclaimed.

527
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:24,179
He says, now I know, see he had heard about the Lord.

528
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,399
He had heard about what God was able to do.

529
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:33,459
In fact, the Bible, there's many interactions as you think about Elijah and Elisha's ministries

530
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:38,239
between the children of Israel and the Syrians and you think about the ways in which they

531
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:46,239
would have heard about the Lord God Jehovah and the servant, the little maid, she says,

532
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:50,880
would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of

533
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
his leprosy.

534
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,760
Elisha, the man of God says to come, but remember what the king of Israel says, am I God to

535
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,039
kill and to make alive?

536
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,279
And so now we find.

537
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,959
that this man, Naaman, who maybe had heard about the Lord and had heard, remember

538
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:11,999
what he said, I thought, in verse number 11, that he, Elisha, will surely come out to

539
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:18,399
me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God. So he had heard, he had

540
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:27,559
known some things about the Lord, but now he says, behold, now I know that there is

541
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:34,599
no God in all the earth but in Israel. What is he really communicating? What is

542
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,959
he saying with the statement, understand that the Syrians, and even as we get

543
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:44,039
further into the text of Scripture, there was an idolatry, a practice of idolatry,

544
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,999
they'd be idolatrous people, and we find that this man, Naaman, is recognizing

545
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:53,839
that, yeah, there's some little g-gods, there's some deities that we worship,

546
00:30:53,839 --> 00:31:00,919
that we sacrifice to, but they're not real. There's only one real God, and now

547
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,839
I know who he is. And that's a great proclamation. And we find this morning

548
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,399
that it's very similar to what Jethro said. Do you remember, as we studied a

549
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,839
couple of weeks ago in Exodus chapter 18, that Jethro, he comes and he's having

550
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,079
that reunion with Moses, and Moses begins to explain to Jethro all that

551
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:28,399
the Lord has done, and we find that Jethro proclaims very similarly to what

552
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,719
Naaman says. He says, now I know. Now I know. And we find that he makes this

553
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:38,919
declaration, and we find that he then says, now therefore, at the end of verse

554
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,479
15, I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant. This would be something that

555
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:48,359
would just be a cultural understanding of what he would do, how he would respond.

556
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:52,919
Remember, when he left, according to verse number 5, when the king of Syria wrote

557
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,279
that letter, he departed and took with him 10 talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of

558
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,639
gold, and 10 changes of raiment. But understand with me that Elisha says,

559
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:10,719
that's not how you get it. I don't need this blessing that you would want to give

560
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:15,319
me. He says, as the Lord liveth in verse 16, Elisha says, before whom I stand,

561
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:24,559
I will receive none. And he, Naaman, urged him, Elisha, to take it, but he refused.

562
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,239
Wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding as to how Naaman was

563
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:37,519
healed. Listen, this morning, I've said to so many people over the years,

564
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,399
when I talk to them about being saved, listen, I never one time told you to come

565
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,639
to church in order to be saved. I never one time told you to put money in an

566
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,239
offering plate in order to be saved. I never told you one time to, you fill in

567
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:53,399
the blank, whatever it might be that people think in order to be saved. Now, I

568
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,519
would say this, I would encourage people after they're saved to be in church. Why?

569
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:03,799
Because that's God's will. But it's not so that you can stay saved. It's the

570
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,959
response of being saved. Listen, when you're born again, I don't know what your

571
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:12,679
experience was. I don't know how old you were when you got saved. But I'll tell

572
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,199
you my own personal testimony. Before I got saved, I really didn't have any

573
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:22,919
interest in being in church. I really didn't. No idea what's going on. I mean,

574
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,479
it's just a, why am I gonna go to church? But then guess what? After I got saved, I

575
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:31,719
had a desire to be in church. I wanted to be in church. I wanted to be with God's

576
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:36,439
people. I wanted to hear God's Word being proclaimed. I wanted to learn, but grow

577
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:39,359
in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Bible says, as

578
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,639
newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that you may grow thereby. You

579
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,919
know how many times I read this Bible through before I got saved? Zero. Not one

580
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,359
time did I read this Bible through before I got saved. I can't tell you how

581
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,959
many times I've read it through now. Countless times. I read it through

582
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:59,999
multiple times a year. Why? Because I love God's Word. Because God gave me a

583
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,919
love. Why? Because I was born again. Do I read it so that I can stay saved? No. I

584
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,519
want to learn about my Savior. I want to know more of how, who He is. I want to

585
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,919
know more about Jesus. Do I come to church? I know on the pastor, it's like

586
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,559
you have to come to church. Can you imagine if the pastor said, you know, I'm

587
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,919
just not gonna come to church today. That'd be kind of a problem. But the

588
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,399
reality is that it's not that I have to. I say to our children, I remember when

589
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,039
Juliana was just a couple of years old and we were going to go back to church

590
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,919
on Sunday night. And she was getting awakened from her nap so that we could

591
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:36,639
go back. And she says, Daddy, do we have to go to church? And I said, no honey, we

592
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,359
don't have to, but we get to. What a difference in perspective. Listen, I don't

593
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,599
have to go to church in order to be saved. But I get to. And I want to. And

594
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,879
begin to think about the the truth here of what's unfolding. And we see this

595
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,039
declaration, what Naaman exclaimed. He says, now I know. But notice with me that

596
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,079
not only what he says, but then notice his actions as we continue to read the

597
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,999
text of Scripture. In verse number 17, after Elisha refused to take the

598
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:14,559
blessing or the gift from Naaman, then we find that Naaman says this in verse 17,

599
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:22,079
Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of

600
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:29,119
earth? That's an interesting request. Naaman says, let me give you a gift.

601
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:37,159
Elisha says, no. He says, I urge you to take it. Elisha says, no, I refuse. And then

602
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:46,559
Naaman says, okay, well, I pray thee, give me two mules burden of earth. Why? Notice

603
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:53,079
the end of verse 17. For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering

604
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:00,239
nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord. I mean, that's awesome. That is

605
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:06,359
absolutely awesome to see what Naaman is declaring here. He says, listen, I'm gonna

606
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:13,439
go back to Syria. But I'd like to take some earth here from Israel, two mules

607
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,839
burden of earth, so that when I go back to Syria and I make offerings, that I'm

608
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:25,199
making those offerings to the Lord Jehovah, not to any other small g gods,

609
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:32,359
deities, idols that he had previously given offerings to. That is absolutely

610
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,999
amazing to see in this portion of Scripture the transformation, what's

611
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:41,839
happened in this man Naaman's life just because of a little maid that had been

612
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,359
taken captive during a military campaign of the Syrians. And she says,

613
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:51,679
understanding the condition of Naaman, would to God my Lord, Naaman, that he was

614
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,959
there with the prophet of God in Israel. Oh, what an encounter. Listen, this man

615
00:36:56,959 --> 00:37:02,719
Naaman, he learned more than just simply there's a prophet in Israel. He learned

616
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:10,439
that the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah God, He is the only God. And he declares in

617
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:15,759
verse number 17, that I will offer thy servant will henceforth offer neither

618
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:23,199
burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord. Then I want you

619
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,639
to see the sensitivity of Naaman. Because Naaman is gonna go back to a

620
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,679
position. He's gonna go back to a culture. He's gonna go back to a place where

621
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,679
where he's going to have some levels of requirements of things. And it's gonna be

622
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:42,479
an interesting transition. But we find that Naaman is sensitive with regard to

623
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:47,719
what he has now learned and been exposed to. And he says to Elisha, in this thing

624
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:54,439
the Lord pardon thy servant. In what thing? That when my master goeth into the

625
00:37:54,439 --> 00:38:01,239
house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in

626
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,479
the house of Rimmon, when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord

627
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:10,719
pardon thy servant in this thing. Man this is sensitivity on the part of

628
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,519
Naaman. He's saying, listen I'm gonna go back to Syria and there's gonna be some

629
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,879
some practices that are going to be taking place that I'm going to, because

630
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,679
of my position and because of what I've done and who I am, I'm gonna be in this

631
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,719
place. And the Lord pardoned this thing. And there's sensitivity on the part of

632
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,959
this man Naaman because of what he understands and how he's purposing to

633
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:39,279
worship Jehovah only. And he said unto him, that's Elisha replying in verse 19,

634
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:44,679
go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. We know that Gehazi makes a

635
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,759
terrible decision. We won't look at the rest of the chapter, but Gehazi makes a

636
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:54,279
terrible decision in seeking to get one of those gifts. And we find that he not

637
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:59,599
only received a gift, but he got leprosy as a result of that. And you can look at

638
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,479
the end of the chapter and read that. But this morning as we look here at this

639
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:12,159
situation, this proclamation of Naaman, this morning, how did Naaman learn about

640
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:21,919
God? Started with a little unnamed servant girl. Listen, this morning it's

641
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:28,959
not about our names being known. It's about the Lord God being exalted. There

642
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,959
are some people of God throughout the history of the church that are recognizable

643
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:43,239
by name. But you know what's very interesting to me is that so often we hear

644
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:48,079
the names of maybe a C.H. Spurgeon, maybe we hear the names of a D.L. Moody, we hear

645
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,799
the names of an Adoniram Judson or a Hudson Taylor. And you can go through the

646
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:57,959
list and you can name some people that you would be familiar with of those that

647
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:00,319
God used in a great way. But what's often...

648
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:07,059
and not known are the people that led those people to Christ.

649
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:09,899
It's very rare that you hear their names.

650
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:10,899
Why?

651
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:11,899
Because it doesn't really matter.

652
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:15,139
In fact, the names of those other people that I mentioned don't really matter either.

653
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:18,739
It's all about the Lord Jesus Christ being exalted.

654
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:22,859
But this morning, if we'd come to a place in our own lives where I think this little

655
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:27,779
maid was, where it's like, listen, I'm just a servant of the Lord God Almighty.

656
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:35,599
No matter where I am, no matter where I am, no matter what the circumstances are that

657
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,639
brought me to the place where I am, my duty is to make Christ known.

658
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:47,299
And it doesn't really matter who knows who I am, because God knows who I am and I'm seeking

659
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:54,939
to simply exalt His name and to let others know about my God.

660
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:58,839
And then I want you to think about Naaman just for a moment.

661
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,639
And I want you to think about what Naaman experienced.

662
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,319
And as we've sought this morning to make application, I understand contextually that he was healed

663
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:12,279
of leprosy and that that's his experience, but then he recognized that there's only one

664
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:14,239
God and that's Jehovah.

665
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,359
And he purposes to worship Him alone.

666
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,359
His life was changed.

667
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,159
If we're to use New Testament vernacular this morning, we'd say that he was born again,

668
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,659
that he's changed.

669
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,179
He is a new creature.

670
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,779
That's the terminology we'd use as New Testament believers this morning as we look at this

671
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,139
text of scripture.

672
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:37,059
And I would say to you this morning that after he experienced what he experienced, do you

673
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:41,939
see how boldly he exclaimed what he exclaimed?

674
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:43,819
Listen, he didn't care.

675
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:48,819
The Bible tells us that when he came back to the house of Elisha in verse 15, notice

676
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:53,859
the Bible says that he returned to the man of God, he, and notice this, and all his company.

677
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,959
He didn't go back to Elisha secretly and make his proclamation.

678
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:04,479
Everyone that came from Syria with him were there and he still stood and proclaimed.

679
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,479
Why?

680
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,479
Because he knew something.

681
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,859
He says, now I know.

682
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,759
I'm convinced of.

683
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:13,799
And this morning I wonder as we look at our own lives and begin to think about Naaman

684
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:23,279
and looking at this passage of scripture and the freshness, the newness of what's happened.

685
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:29,019
If we're not careful, we can become like the church at Ephesus where we've lost our first

686
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,619
love.

687
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,499
We can get in that place where we've just kind of gotten used to.

688
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:39,859
We've kind of gotten a little cold, if you will, gotten a little indifferent, if you

689
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:40,859
will.

690
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:45,779
We've believed the lie of the enemy that nobody wants to hear.

691
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:54,159
It's kind of, it's not as fresh as it was when it first happened.

692
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,559
Do you remember when you first got saved?

693
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,079
Man, you first got saved, you understood, listen, let me tell you what Christ did for

694
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,079
me.

695
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,359
Let me tell you how He changed my life.

696
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:14,119
I mean, let me tell you how I was on a road leading to a Christless eternity.

697
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:17,899
I had no peace and no hope and no joy.

698
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:23,379
But now, as a child of God, I have, as Miss Lorene sang this morning, exceeding joy.

699
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:24,379
Why?

700
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:25,379
Because He is my exceeding joy.

701
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:26,379
I have peace.

702
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:27,379
Why?

703
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:30,499
Because He is my peace and He gives me a peace that passeth all understanding.

704
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:31,499
I have hope.

705
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:32,499
Why?

706
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:35,499
Because He is my hope and He says that He's coming back and I'm going to spend forever

707
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:36,499
with Him.

708
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:41,859
And begin to think about, listen, sometimes it can just kind of, if we're not careful,

709
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:49,319
we can kind of lose, in time, that fervency.

710
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:55,079
And as I look at Naaman here, he stands and, man, he exclaims.

711
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,999
He didn't care who was there.

712
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:00,559
He didn't care, I don't think he cared what they thought.

713
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:09,759
And this morning, I wonder, as we look at an example of Naaman, how are we doing on

714
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:14,579
proclaiming how great our God is, declaring how great our God is?

715
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:20,339
Listen, I believe this morning, with every fiber of my being, that those of you that

716
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:24,259
are gathered here this morning, that each of us that are here, that we've discovered

717
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:29,099
God's greatness, that we could stand and we could testify of how great God is.

718
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,179
We can sing the songs.

719
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:34,139
We could give the answers.

720
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,699
If someone were to say, right on a list, five reasons that God is great, I think we could

721
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:42,399
all at least do five.

722
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:45,719
Extra credit, we could put more down, right?

723
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:52,639
But I wonder this morning, I ask myself, I ask you to ask yourself, in closing, how am

724
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:59,039
I doing not in simply knowing that God is great, but how am I doing in declaring that

725
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:00,879
God is great?

726
00:45:00,879 --> 00:45:04,619
In letting other people know how great my God is.

727
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,959
Naaman, he had an expectation.

728
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:15,059
He didn't get what he expected at the first go, but then he had an experience.

729
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,819
He humbled himself.

730
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:24,039
He obeyed what the man of God said, and he was clean, man.

731
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,939
And then he exclaimed, now I know.

732
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:29,939
There's no God in all the earth, but in Israel.

733
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,319
Notice he's speaking of the Lord God Jehovah.

734
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:40,399
He's the only God, and I'm so thankful that this morning we get to live in a place knowing

735
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:45,839
the God of the Bible, and being able to make Him known to others.

736
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,839
Let's pray.

737
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:47,839
Father, we love you.

738
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,839
We thank you for loving us.

739
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,799
We thank you for this Bible account.

740
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:59,399
We can look at the events and we can rejoice in what took place, but as we make application

741
00:45:59,399 --> 00:46:06,819
in our lives, I pray that we'd humbly search our own hearts.

742
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:12,459
Father, maybe there's someone here this morning that has never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

743
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:13,859
as their personal Savior.

744
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,539
Maybe they've not humbled themselves.

745
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:21,339
Maybe they're still leaning on their own understanding.

746
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:30,119
Maybe they're believing some other teaching with regard to the way of salvation that would

747
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,559
not be in agreement with what You said in Your Word.

748
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,879
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

749
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:43,279
That they'd understand, they'd humble themselves, that they'd obey what the Word of God says.

750
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:49,139
For by grace, through faith, alone, Christ alone.

751
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,039
It's not Christ in my works, it's Christ alone.

752
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,799
If righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

753
00:46:56,799 --> 00:46:59,599
We know that our Savior did not die in vain.

754
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,519
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray that today would be the day of their

755
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:06,559
salvation.

756
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:13,319
For every person that knows You as their Lord and Savior, God, I pray that we'd evaluate

757
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:20,939
our lives, not with regard specifically to knowing how great You are, but that we'd evaluate

758
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:26,939
our lives specifically with regard to declaring how great You are.

759
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:30,019
I pray, God, that You'd use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

760
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:34,619
I pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way in every

761
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:40,299
life and every heart, Lord, that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

762
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:42,419
We'll give You the honor and glory for that which You'll do.

763
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:43,719
It's in Christ's name we pray.

764
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:44,719
Would you stand with me?

765
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:45,719
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
