WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.079
with the thought the real theme of the series being the Lord is my

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:08.680
dot dot dot was kind of the the series for about 15 weeks or so on Wednesday

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.399
evenings

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.479
and we dealt with the fact that about six weeks ago the Lord is my exceeding

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.159
joy

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.200
and after that message Miss Lorraine came to me and said do you know the song

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.520
the Lord is my exceeding joy and I said I didn't know there was a song

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.479
the Lord is my exceeding joy and so she sang a little bit of it to me back there

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.719
after the service on that Wednesday evening

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.639
and I'm thankful that you're able to sing the entirety of it this morning

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:32.959
certainly a blessing

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.720
and I said this during that message about six weeks ago listen there are a

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.720
lot of things that people try to find joy and happiness in in this world

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.400
and but when we understand that Jesus

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.400
is my joy he is my exceeding joy listen he never changes he's the same yesterday

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.520
and today and forever

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.840
and we have circumstances that change you get new things that get old and they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720
break and they wear down and

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:03.479
whatever it might be but the reality is that if he is my joy then I am able to

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.040
have he said that my joy might remain in you

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.839
and that your joy might be full as I read that verse from John 15

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:14.919
and what a tremendous blessing thank you for that song

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:18.800
this morning the book of second Kings this morning second Kings chapter number

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.480
five

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.360
second Kings chapter number five and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.720
a couple of weeks ago we dealt with the subject matter of the proclamation

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.040
of Jethro and then last week we dealt with the proclamation of Rahab this

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.760
morning

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.519
we're gonna deal with address the subject matter of the proclamation of

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:39.639
Naaman here from second Kings chapter number five let me say this by way of

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.400
introduction I am thankful

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.319
to live in a country where the gospel has been faithfully proclaimed

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.480
and the reality is that the United States of America is a place in which

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.480
the gospel has been

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800
readily available that it has been preached and it's been

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.559
delivered from one generation to another it does not mean that everyone within

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:05.160
our nation has heard the gospel or that everyone within our nation is saved we

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.120
know that not to be the case

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.160
but I'm thankful to be in a land where the gospel is known

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.039
I'm thankful to be in a land today we're still today

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:20.080
we can go we have the freedom to be able to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.919
Christ to those

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.160
that we would come into contact with and that is a tremendous blessing you know

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.679
there are places around the globe today

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.479
that people have never one time heard the name of Jesus

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:39.399
the gospel is not declared in a number of those lands around the globe today

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:44.080
then you can look at some lands today where there are some believers there

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.559
some Christians

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.759
but they do not have the freedom to faithfully

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.600
and freely share the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.000
just openly with those that they come into contact with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.600
they face great danger they face great levels of persecution

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.360
and we understand this morning that we have a mandate from the Lord a command

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.279
from the Lord

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.720
to make him known to preach the gospel to every creature

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.960
now whether we have the freedom from a government to do that or not

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.039
doesn't really change the command that we've been given

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:24.800
but I would say this living in a place where we understand the command that God

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.639
has given

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.160
but also coupled with the fact that we have the freedom to proclaim it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.240
we better take advantage of that and we better be careful

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.639
and be diligent to be able to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.119
as we come to second Kings chapter number five were introduced to a man by

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.240
the name of Naaman

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.639
thus the title of the message the proclamation of Naaman

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.279
but were introduced to a man by the name of Naaman who's Assyrian

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:55.479
and he does not as we look at the passage of scripture he does not know

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.919
Jehovah God he does not know the God of the Bible

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.479
and at the onset of this passage of scripture

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.399
and I'm thankful that though he was in a situation in a land where he did not

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.119
know

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:12.960
the Lord that through some very divine circumstances God

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.000
allowed for this man to know

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.320
who he is I'm thankful this morning that God

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.359
wants to make himself known to his creation

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:26.799
God wants to make himself known to mankind

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.799
God is a loving God he

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:35.720
died for the sins of the world and he desires to make himself known

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.760
and I'm thankful that as we look at this passage of scripture

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:43.079
that this man Naaman will understand who God is notice with me

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.160
as we begin reading in second Kings chapter number five

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.200
and as we're introduced to this man notice how he is described the Bible

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.279
says in verse number one now Naaman

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.119
captain of the host of the king of Syria

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.000
was a great man with his master an honorable

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.359
because by him the Lord had given deliverance into Syria

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.559
he was also a mighty man in valor

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.799
but he was a leper he was a leper

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.799
we look at the description that is provided to us in verse number one

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:19.799
we see that he's described as being the captain of the host of the king of Syria

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:23.799
a great man with his master the Bible says that he's

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:27.920
honorable the Bible tells us that he's a mighty man in valor

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480
the Bible tells us that he is a leper though the Bible does not say this in

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.679
verse number one I believe it would be accurate for us to be able to say

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.640
that he did not know the Lord he did not know the Lord

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.839
we find as we look at this passage of scripture we see what's taking place we

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.359
find that in verse number two

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:50.880
God introduces to us and reveals to us some circumstances that had transpired

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.440
that God was going to use for his honor for his glory notice in verse number two

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.920
the Bible says that the Syrians had gone out by companies

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.679
and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:08.200
a little maid and she this little maid this servant girl this

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.799
captive the Bible says that she waited

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:17.359
on Naaman's wife now as we look at just that statement

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.399
before we get into the interaction that God gives us here between Naaman and

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.239
Elisha

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:26.320
I believe that it's important that we recognize a few important truths as we

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.040
look at this verse of scripture

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.559
and see what this little maid this little servant girl this

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.600
little Israeli what she says

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.200
to her master to Naaman's wife

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.720
the Bible says in verse number three that she said unto her mistress

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.279
would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria now she's speaking

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.519
of Naaman and she says would God

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:55.600
that Naaman were with the prophet that is in Samaria that's

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.760
Elisha and notice what the Bible says

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.359
the Bible says that he Elisha would recover him

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:07.320
of his leprosy as we look at this text of scripture were introduced here to

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.720
this

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.679
little servant girl this little maid she's

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:14.880
unnamed but we find that God would use her in a great way

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.920
as we look at the circumstances surrounding

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.440
this little maid ending up in the home of

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.000
Naaman we could look at it from the perspective of saying these are

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.399
unfortunate circumstances the Bible tells us that the Syrians had gone out

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.480
by companies

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.760
and they brought away captive out of the land of Israel

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.559
and this little maid came back as a captive

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:41.000
because of this military conquest that took place

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.640
and if you were the parents of that little girl you would probably be

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.760
disappointed

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.119
you would have heart that would be heavy

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.760
and you would look at that circumstance and we could look at it as being this is

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.839
unfortunate

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:57.559
but I want you to understand this morning that our God is sovereign

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:01.519
I want you to understand this morning that our God has a plan

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.040
and I'm thankful that God always has a plan

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.519
and I'm thankful this morning that as we consider the character in the nature in

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.279
the attributes of our God

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:14.600
that our God is a God who is gracious

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.720
our God is a God who is merciful and he allows this little maid this little girl

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:23.320
to be to be taken captive

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.440
and to end up a servant to Naaman's

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.359
wife. Naaman we've already been introduced in verse number one

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:37.880
with regard to the the description that is provided to us but the Bible

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.080
ends and says that he was a leper

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.640
at the end of verse number one and it's because of this

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.280
this disease this health concern

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.599
that this little maid after some period of time as she experiences and

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.159
understands what's taking place

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:59.919
the Bible says that this little maid she makes this statement in verse number

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.479
three as she's speaking to Naaman's wife

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:06.520
she says would God my Lord were with the prophet

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.599
that is in Samaria for he would recover him

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:12.599
of his leprosy. She was so convincing

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:16.159
as she spoke to the wife of Naaman

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:19.919
that we find that action takes place immediately

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:23.880
after she makes this known it says that one went in in verse number four

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.239
and told his Lord saying thus and thus said the maid

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:32.880
that is of the land of Israel. Now can you imagine how God would use this little

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.679
maid we don't know her name we don't know anything about her

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:40.479
but we know that she was faithful to stand up and speak up for the Lord

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:43.479
Amen. She's a

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:47.440
servant. Someone could easily say to her hey

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.919
hey no one asked you to speak right

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.960
but she stood up and she spoke up and

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.000
she speaks about the situation she had confidence

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.080
I believe not only in Elisha but in the God

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.540
God of Elisha.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.780
As you begin to think about the miracles of Elijah

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.220
and the miracles of Elisha,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.500
we understand that God would use those men

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.180
in miraculous ways just as he used so many of God's people,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.220
just as he would continue to use us even today,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.460
but it's God who does the work.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.500
When we think about the miracles of Elijah,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
when we think about the miracles of Elisha,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.280
that's God's power being displayed

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.740
and he's using those individuals.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.380
As we look here and we find that the servant comes in

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.800
and says to his master,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.120
thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.880
And notice now the Bible says that the king of Syria

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.880
gets involved in verse number five,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.760
and it says, and the king of Syria said, go to go.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.120
And I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.680
And he departed and took with him 10 talents of silver

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.980
and 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of raiment.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.480
I mean, a large sum of money,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.840
really a gift, if you will, a reward.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.600
And he sends this and he sends this letter.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.760
So the king of Syria, hearing all that has transpired

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.920
and understanding the place of Naaman,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.080
he writes this letter to the king of Israel

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.920
and the king of Israel receives the letter.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.700
Now he's not so excited about the letter that he receives

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.440
for the Bible tells us in verse number six,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.520
now, when this letter has come unto thee,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.940
behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.800
that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.700
Now there's no way that the king of Israel

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.820
is going to even begin to know

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.180
how he might be able to do something like this.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.300
The Bible says that as receiving this letter

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.740
in verse number seven, it came to pass

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.640
when the king of Israel had read the letter

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.380
that he rent his clothes and said,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.920
am I God to kill and to make alive

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.460
that this man doth send unto me

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.880
to recover a man of his leprosy?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.020
Wherefore, consider, I pray you,

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.220
and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.980
The king of Israel is beside himself.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.020
He doesn't know what to do with the circumstances

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.640
that are unfolding, and he says,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.640
what am I supposed to do about this?

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.580
And we find that Elisha, according to verse number eight,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.980
he hears about what has taken place.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.140
The king of Israel is overwhelmed.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.600
Elisha is informed, he's understanding what's taking place.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.940
It says in verse number eight, and it was so,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.800
when Elisha, the man of God,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.960
had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.040
that he sent to the king saying,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.980
wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.200
Now, notice what Elisha says.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.080
Let him, speaking of Naaman, come now to me,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.080
and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.760
Now, I want you to understand this morning

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.480
that not only would Naaman know

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.300
that there's a prophet in Israel,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.340
but most importantly, he would know God.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.660
And as we look at the portion of scripture,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.460
as we see what's taking place,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.860
and we've mentioned as we've studied this year

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.200
dealing with how great our God is,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.420
and man, we sang some wonderful songs this morning,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.620
our great savior, and what a great savior he is,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.140
and how great thou art,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.480
and thinking about the plan that God has,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.440
and rejoicing in the fact of his creation,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.540
and seeing his greatness,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.860
and then understanding his plan of redemption,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.220
and his greatness that is revealed therein,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.580
and then understanding as we sing that fourth verse

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.620
of how great thou art,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.980
that one day he's coming back,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.140
and oh, how great our God is,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.700
but we understand this morning

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.860
that even as we recognize how great he is,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.420
we must declare how great he is,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.900
and we see this proclamation on the part of Naaman,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.180
and notice with me if you're taking notes this morning,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.080
number one is we've gotten into the interaction,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.060
but now between Naaman and Elisha,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.020
I want you to notice with me number one,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.020
consider what Naaman expected, what he expected.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.100
Everyone has expectations, everyone has expectations.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.520
You go out to eat somewhere,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.500
you have an expectation as to what you're gonna receive.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.520
You go have a meeting with someone,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.960
you have an expectation, you just have expectations.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.380
I often say to my children,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.020
and to those that I have opportunity

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.060
to have influence in that we should manage expectations,

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.940
that we should communicate with people

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.400
so that we could manage their expectations, why?

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.680
Because if they come in with high expectations

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.500
and they're not realized,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.940
then people can be greatly disappointed,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.300
and we find that people have expectations in life,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.740
and we find that as we look at this text of scripture

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.940
that Naaman, he expected something to happen

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.100
as he entered into, now remember,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.020
why he's going to Elisha in the first place.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.160
He's going to Elisha in the first place

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.100
because the little servant, the little maid

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.260
that was waiting on his wife

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.940
that had been taken captive from Israel,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.220
she says, would to God my Lord,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.780
remember we read it already,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.020
was with the prophet that is in Samaria, why?

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.620
For he would recover him of his leprosy.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.180
And so he goes expecting to be recovered of his leprosy,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.340
but really his expectation is revealed to us

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.760
as we look at the text of scripture,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.020
but notice how the interaction begins.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.420
In verse number nine, the Bible says,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.340
so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.860
and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.880
Now, I hope this morning in your mind's eye

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.060
that you can see the picture of this unfolding,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.540
this leper, this man from Syria that's heard this message,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.700
he's been convinced based upon what the little maid says,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.220
and the king of Syria sends a letter

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.100
to the king of Israel, Elisha says,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.980
let him come to me and don't be troubled,

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.340
let him come to me, and we find that now this man,

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.780
he's there, Naaman, the Bible says,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.020
with his horses and with his chariot,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.380
and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.820
Now, right from the beginning,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.520
if you go to somebody's house

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.740
and you know that it's the person

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.000
that you're looking to have an interaction with,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.360
what do you expect?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.360
Expect they're gonna come and answer the door.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.180
Right, I mean, it'd be kind of an easy level of expectation,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.040
but we find that in the text of scripture,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.880
the Bible tells us in verse number 10

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.720
that Elisha sent a messenger, he sent a messenger.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.440
Now, Naaman's traveled, he's come to this place,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.240
he's heard what the little maid said,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.720
and he's convinced, and he comes,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.680
and Elisha even said to the king,

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.000
let him come, that he would know

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.640
that there's a prophet in Israel,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.920
and now as Naaman is standing there

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.800
before the house of Elisha, he's at the right place.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.080
He's not at the wrong house, he's not at the wrong address,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.680
he wasn't given bad directions, he's at the right place.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.560
And Elisha sends a messenger.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.800
And here's what Elisha says to that messenger.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.120
The messenger comes with a simple set of instructions.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.000
Notice in verse number 10.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Go and wash in Jordan seven times,

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.880
and thy flesh shall come again to thee,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.000
and thou shalt be clean.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.720
That's not complicated, is it?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.320
That's pretty straightforward.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.640
I mean, a very simple set of instructions.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.640
He tells him where to go, to the Jordan,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.920
it's a specific place, he would know where that place is.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.560
We find that he tells him to dip in the Jordan,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.800
to wash in the Jordan, seven times.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.520
There's a specific number of times.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.200
He doesn't just, it's not instruction

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.320
that is like some of the manuals that you read today,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.520
and you're saying, I don't know,

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.960
like, should I turn this a different way?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.200
It doesn't make any sense.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.040
No, no, go to a specific place, wash seven times,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.200
and here's what the result will be.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.040
Thou, notice it says, thy flesh shall come again to thee,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.000
and thou shalt be clean.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.560
This is not what Naaman expected.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.480
Not for one second is this what Naaman expected.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.760
Naaman, in fact, is angry.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.800
The Bible describes it this way, that he was wroth.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.360
In verse number 11, the Bible says,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.760
but Naaman was wroth and went away.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.720
Notice what he says, behold, I thought.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.360
Now, here's where the text of Scripture

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.320
reveals to us what he, Naaman, expected to happen.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.080
In verse number 11, he begins to share

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080
with those servants that are there with him

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.679
after he hears what the messenger from Elisha says.

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:41.200
He says, here's what I thought was going to happen.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.520
He, who's he speaking of?

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.720
He's speaking of Elisha.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.720
He, Elisha the prophet, he will surely come out to me

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.320
and stand and call on the name of the Lord, his God,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.000
and strike his hand over a place and recover the leper.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.640
So he expected that there's gonna be some show.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.280
I mean, there's gonna be, Elisha's gonna come out

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.040
and he's gonna raise up his hands

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.440
and he's gonna call on the Lord, his God,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.920
and he's gonna strike his hand and bam,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.960
he's gonna be healed of his leprosy.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.000
I mean, that's what he's expecting.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.840
Now, I could understand why he'd have that expectation.

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:21.119
I could understand why Naaman coming to the house of Elisha

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.320
would have this expectation of how this would play out.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.559
I mean, can you imagine being a leper?

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.640
Can you imagine being in that situation?

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.920
The Bible doesn't tell us,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.280
but I think about the position of Naaman.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.720
I think that they probably did everything they could do

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.440
in order to deal with this issue of leprosy

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.320
with zero success.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.239
Do you remember the woman in the gospel accounts

00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:45.340
that had the issue of blood for 12 years?

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.480
The Bible says that she spent everything,

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.400
she tried everything by going to the medical professions

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.840
to be healed with no help whatsoever.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.239
And she said, if I could just touch the hem of his garment.

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:05.199
And Jesus says, who touched me?

00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:06.759
Who touched me?

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:10.719
And when she touched the hem of his garment, what happened immediately?

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:11.719
She was healed.

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.479
She was made whole.

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:20.479
Naaman had some expectation and I think that he's probably done everything.

00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:25.439
Remember he's the captain of the host and remember that as we look at what's taking

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:30.719
place, I mean the king of Syria writes a letter on his behalf.

00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:37.799
No doubt all of the remedies and all of the things have been exhausted that they could

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:42.559
do and he has this expectation that the man of God, Elisha, he's going to come out and

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:45.079
he says, here's what I thought, but he's angry.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.079
Why?

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.199
Because it doesn't happen like he says.

00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:49.599
He continues and he says this in verse number 12.

00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:56.359
He says, are not Abana and Farfar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?

00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:59.039
May I not wash in them and be clean?

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:05.239
So he turned and went away in a rage.

00:21:05.239 --> 00:21:07.079
Instructions were not complicated.

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:08.079
Very simple instructions.

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:11.239
He begins to lean on his own understanding.

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:16.039
He says, we've got rivers back in Syria that are better than this river.

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:20.839
The Jordan, I'm going to dip in that water?

00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:27.119
We've got cleaner, better waters that I could dip in and be clean if that's all it is.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.119
I mean can you see?

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.199
I mean he's angry.

00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:33.399
The Bible says that he's in a rage at the end of verse number 12.

00:21:33.399 --> 00:21:37.959
He's angry over what's taking place, but we notice, we consider in the text of Scripture

00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:42.499
as this interaction unfolds for us, we consider first of all what Naaman expected.

00:21:42.499 --> 00:21:46.899
Number two, if you're taking notes, I want you to consider with me what Naaman experienced.

00:21:46.899 --> 00:21:49.379
Notice what he experienced.

00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:50.379
He's ready to leave.

00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:51.379
He's wroth.

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:55.859
He's in a rage, but there's a servant that comes to him in verse number three and I'm

00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:58.779
thankful for the plea of this servant.

00:21:58.779 --> 00:22:03.979
The servant pleads with his master and it says in verse 13 that his servants came near

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:10.259
and spake unto him and said, my father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:13.139
wouldst thou not have done it?

00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:20.819
So he's pleading with Naaman and he's saying if the instruction were to do some great thing,

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:22.019
you would have followed it.

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:24.619
You would have done it.

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:31.139
And he says at the end of verse number 13, how much rather then when he saith to thee,

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:35.939
wash and be clean.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:41.859
This servant, again, we don't have the name of this individual in verse number 13 who

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:50.139
speaks to Naaman, he's pleading with him and he, through some logical explanation, convinces

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:53.639
Naaman to follow the instruction.

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:56.299
So Naaman had to humble himself.

00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:59.539
Naaman had to follow the instructions that were provided.

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:02.799
He had to stop leaning on his own understanding.

00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:08.919
He had to submit to the instruction that has been provided.

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:21.319
You know how often today people ignore and refuse to obey the simple truth of the gospel?

00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:22.959
Because they're leaning on their own understanding.

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:25.679
It's got to be something more to it.

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:28.599
I mean, there's got to be something more I have to do.

00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:29.919
I've heard that so many times.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:33.239
Listen, there's nothing you can do to save yourself.

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:34.639
There's nothing you need to do.

00:23:34.639 --> 00:23:36.479
There's nothing that you can do.

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:39.959
You can't help God save you.

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:41.319
He did it all.

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.879
I'm so thankful for that wonderful Bible truth.

00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:45.639
And you know what people have to do?

00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:48.099
They have to humble themselves.

00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:52.119
They have to humble themselves that they're going to stop believing whatever it was that

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:58.039
they believed beforehand, stop believing that there's some better way, some other way.

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.319
They have to submit.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:01.239
Listen, there was only one way.

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:07.439
I would argue until I had no breath left in me that there was only one way for Naaman

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:11.379
to be healed of his leprosy.

00:24:11.379 --> 00:24:14.359
He could have dunked in that Jordan five times.

00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.999
He's not going to be healed.

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:18.079
He could have decided that he's going to do...

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:20.880
There was one way that Naaman was going to be healed of his leprosy.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.880
Why?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:29.119
Because the man of God was speaking what God, the Lord, told him to speak.

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:34.239
And I could say to you this morning, and I understand that as we live in this ever-changing

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:40.279
culture that it's becoming less and less popular to stand and proclaim that Jesus is the only

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:47.239
way, but I tell you based upon the authority of God's precious Word that Jesus is the only

00:24:47.239 --> 00:24:48.599
way.

00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:55.079
There's no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:25:00.799
And this morning as we look at this text of Scripture and we see what Naaman experienced,

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.759
this servant comes and pleads.

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:04.319
I mean, Naaman's ready to leave.

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:05.319
I can see him.

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:08.039
I mean, he's a man that's in charge.

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.699
I mean, he's a leader.

00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:13.720
He's ready to get everything and leave and go back and he's angry.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.160
And this servant pleads with him and he says, listen, how much rather than when he sayeth

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.319
to thee, wash and be clean.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:31.160
And then the Bible says that then, notice verse 14, then went he down and dipped himself

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.720
seven times in Jordan.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.759
Notice the next phrase.

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:41.440
This is so important for us to understand, according to the saying of the man of God.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:49.959
He humbled himself and he obeyed that which he had been told to do from the man of God.

00:25:49.959 --> 00:25:55.440
The Bible tells us in verse number 14 that he does this and it says at the end of verse

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.839
14, notice what it says, and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child.

00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:07.440
And then notice the last phrase, and he was clean.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.359
He was clean.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:11.519
What an experience.

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:18.759
I mean, as I look at the circumstances surrounding this event in 2 Kings chapter 5, as God would

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.519
give us the record of this man Naaman and noticing what he expected and his disappointment

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:31.639
and his anger and his rage and his plan to depart and how God used a servant back home

00:26:31.639 --> 00:26:38.239
in Syria to say, would to God my Lord, we're in Israel there with the prophet of God for

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:40.239
he would heal him of his leprosy.

00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:44.119
And then there's another servant that says, listen, why don't you just follow what the

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.660
man of God says?

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.959
And we find that Naaman humbles himself.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.319
I mean, you see him as he gets down into the Jordan River.

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:56.599
I mean, as he humbles himself and he obeys what the man of God says, he gets down into

00:26:56.599 --> 00:27:01.679
the Jordan River and he dips himself one time and he comes back up and there's no change

00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:06.399
and he does it a second time and there's no change in number three and number four.

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:11.599
And we find that the Bible tells us that as he dips that seventh time again, following

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:17.359
what God said through his servant, Elisha, his flesh came again like the flesh of a little

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:21.440
child and he was clean.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.519
Wow.

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:26.279
What an experience.

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:32.880
What an experience that this man had.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.559
And we find that this experience in his life, this event that we read of in verse number

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:44.079
14 had a profound impact upon him.

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:50.959
And it brings us to really the main emphasis of the message this morning, that proclamation

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:53.119
of Naaman number three in your notes.

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:58.079
If you're taking notes, consider with me what Naaman exclaimed.

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:03.599
I mean, he had an expectation and then there's a great experience, but then there's this

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:07.000
exclamation, what he exclaimed.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.039
Notice in verse 14, it talks about him being clean and then it says, and he returned in

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:14.959
verse number 15 to the man of God.

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:19.399
He and all his company and came and stood before him.

00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:23.599
Now notice with me at this particular time, remember what happens the first time he comes

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:27.880
to the door of Elisha, Elisha doesn't come out.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.640
Elisha sends a messenger with a simple set of instructions.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.880
And we find that they go down to the Jordan River and he dips seven times and he's made

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880
clean.

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:42.399
And now he and all of his company, they returned to the house of Elisha.

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:46.839
And it seems as you read the text of scripture, it seems as if Elisha is standing there and

00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:54.959
waiting for him because he gets there and notice what he says.

00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:56.559
I don't think he said it quietly.

00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:01.359
I don't think he said it sheepishly.

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:11.320
He says, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.599
Now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant.

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:18.719
So notice with me as we consider what he exclaimed.

00:29:18.719 --> 00:29:24.179
He says, now I know, see he had heard about the Lord.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:27.399
He had heard about what God was able to do.

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:33.459
In fact, the Bible, there's many interactions as you think about Elijah and Elisha's ministries

00:29:33.459 --> 00:29:38.239
between the children of Israel and the Syrians and you think about the ways in which they

00:29:38.239 --> 00:29:46.239
would have heard about the Lord God Jehovah and the servant, the little maid, she says,

00:29:46.239 --> 00:29:50.880
would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880
his leprosy.

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:57.760
Elisha, the man of God says to come, but remember what the king of Israel says, am I God to

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.039
kill and to make alive?

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.279
And so now we find.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:05.959
that this man, Naaman, who maybe had heard about the Lord and had heard, remember

00:30:05.959 --> 00:30:11.999
what he said, I thought, in verse number 11, that he, Elisha, will surely come out to

00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:18.399
me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God. So he had heard, he had

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:27.559
known some things about the Lord, but now he says, behold, now I know that there is

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:34.599
no God in all the earth but in Israel. What is he really communicating? What is

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:38.959
he saying with the statement, understand that the Syrians, and even as we get

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:44.039
further into the text of Scripture, there was an idolatry, a practice of idolatry,

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:48.999
they'd be idolatrous people, and we find that this man, Naaman, is recognizing

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:53.839
that, yeah, there's some little g-gods, there's some deities that we worship,

00:30:53.839 --> 00:31:00.919
that we sacrifice to, but they're not real. There's only one real God, and now

00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:06.839
I know who he is. And that's a great proclamation. And we find this morning

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:10.399
that it's very similar to what Jethro said. Do you remember, as we studied a

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:15.839
couple of weeks ago in Exodus chapter 18, that Jethro, he comes and he's having

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:22.079
that reunion with Moses, and Moses begins to explain to Jethro all that

00:31:22.239 --> 00:31:28.399
the Lord has done, and we find that Jethro proclaims very similarly to what

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:34.719
Naaman says. He says, now I know. Now I know. And we find that he makes this

00:31:34.719 --> 00:31:38.919
declaration, and we find that he then says, now therefore, at the end of verse

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:44.479
15, I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant. This would be something that

00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:48.359
would just be a cultural understanding of what he would do, how he would respond.

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:52.919
Remember, when he left, according to verse number 5, when the king of Syria wrote

00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:57.279
that letter, he departed and took with him 10 talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:03.639
gold, and 10 changes of raiment. But understand with me that Elisha says,

00:32:03.639 --> 00:32:10.719
that's not how you get it. I don't need this blessing that you would want to give

00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:15.319
me. He says, as the Lord liveth in verse 16, Elisha says, before whom I stand,

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:24.559
I will receive none. And he, Naaman, urged him, Elisha, to take it, but he refused.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:31.239
Wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding as to how Naaman was

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:37.519
healed. Listen, this morning, I've said to so many people over the years,

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:41.399
when I talk to them about being saved, listen, I never one time told you to come

00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:45.639
to church in order to be saved. I never one time told you to put money in an

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:49.239
offering plate in order to be saved. I never told you one time to, you fill in

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:53.399
the blank, whatever it might be that people think in order to be saved. Now, I

00:32:53.399 --> 00:32:56.519
would say this, I would encourage people after they're saved to be in church. Why?

00:32:56.519 --> 00:33:03.799
Because that's God's will. But it's not so that you can stay saved. It's the

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:08.959
response of being saved. Listen, when you're born again, I don't know what your

00:33:08.959 --> 00:33:12.679
experience was. I don't know how old you were when you got saved. But I'll tell

00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:16.199
you my own personal testimony. Before I got saved, I really didn't have any

00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:22.919
interest in being in church. I really didn't. No idea what's going on. I mean,

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:27.479
it's just a, why am I gonna go to church? But then guess what? After I got saved, I

00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:31.719
had a desire to be in church. I wanted to be in church. I wanted to be with God's

00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:36.439
people. I wanted to hear God's Word being proclaimed. I wanted to learn, but grow

00:33:36.439 --> 00:33:39.359
in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Bible says, as

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:42.639
newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that you may grow thereby. You

00:33:42.639 --> 00:33:47.919
know how many times I read this Bible through before I got saved? Zero. Not one

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:51.359
time did I read this Bible through before I got saved. I can't tell you how

00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:53.959
many times I've read it through now. Countless times. I read it through

00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:59.999
multiple times a year. Why? Because I love God's Word. Because God gave me a

00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:04.919
love. Why? Because I was born again. Do I read it so that I can stay saved? No. I

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:08.519
want to learn about my Savior. I want to know more of how, who He is. I want to

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:12.919
know more about Jesus. Do I come to church? I know on the pastor, it's like

00:34:12.919 --> 00:34:16.559
you have to come to church. Can you imagine if the pastor said, you know, I'm

00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:19.919
just not gonna come to church today. That'd be kind of a problem. But the

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:24.399
reality is that it's not that I have to. I say to our children, I remember when

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:28.039
Juliana was just a couple of years old and we were going to go back to church

00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:32.919
on Sunday night. And she was getting awakened from her nap so that we could

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:36.639
go back. And she says, Daddy, do we have to go to church? And I said, no honey, we

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:42.359
don't have to, but we get to. What a difference in perspective. Listen, I don't

00:34:42.359 --> 00:34:48.599
have to go to church in order to be saved. But I get to. And I want to. And

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:52.879
begin to think about the the truth here of what's unfolding. And we see this

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:59.039
declaration, what Naaman exclaimed. He says, now I know. But notice with me that

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:05.079
not only what he says, but then notice his actions as we continue to read the

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:09.999
text of Scripture. In verse number 17, after Elisha refused to take the

00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:14.559
blessing or the gift from Naaman, then we find that Naaman says this in verse 17,

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:22.079
Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of

00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:29.119
earth? That's an interesting request. Naaman says, let me give you a gift.

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:37.159
Elisha says, no. He says, I urge you to take it. Elisha says, no, I refuse. And then

00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:46.559
Naaman says, okay, well, I pray thee, give me two mules burden of earth. Why? Notice

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:53.079
the end of verse 17. For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering

00:35:53.079 --> 00:36:00.239
nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord. I mean, that's awesome. That is

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:06.359
absolutely awesome to see what Naaman is declaring here. He says, listen, I'm gonna

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:13.439
go back to Syria. But I'd like to take some earth here from Israel, two mules

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:18.839
burden of earth, so that when I go back to Syria and I make offerings, that I'm

00:36:18.839 --> 00:36:25.199
making those offerings to the Lord Jehovah, not to any other small g gods,

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:32.359
deities, idols that he had previously given offerings to. That is absolutely

00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:36.999
amazing to see in this portion of Scripture the transformation, what's

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:41.839
happened in this man Naaman's life just because of a little maid that had been

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:46.359
taken captive during a military campaign of the Syrians. And she says,

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:51.679
understanding the condition of Naaman, would to God my Lord, Naaman, that he was

00:36:51.679 --> 00:36:56.959
there with the prophet of God in Israel. Oh, what an encounter. Listen, this man

00:36:56.959 --> 00:37:02.719
Naaman, he learned more than just simply there's a prophet in Israel. He learned

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:10.439
that the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah God, He is the only God. And he declares in

00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:15.759
verse number 17, that I will offer thy servant will henceforth offer neither

00:37:15.759 --> 00:37:23.199
burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord. Then I want you

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:27.639
to see the sensitivity of Naaman. Because Naaman is gonna go back to a

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:31.679
position. He's gonna go back to a culture. He's gonna go back to a place where

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:36.679
where he's going to have some levels of requirements of things. And it's gonna be

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:42.479
an interesting transition. But we find that Naaman is sensitive with regard to

00:37:42.479 --> 00:37:47.719
what he has now learned and been exposed to. And he says to Elisha, in this thing

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:54.439
the Lord pardon thy servant. In what thing? That when my master goeth into the

00:37:54.439 --> 00:38:01.239
house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:05.479
the house of Rimmon, when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord

00:38:05.479 --> 00:38:10.719
pardon thy servant in this thing. Man this is sensitivity on the part of

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:14.519
Naaman. He's saying, listen I'm gonna go back to Syria and there's gonna be some

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:18.879
some practices that are going to be taking place that I'm going to, because

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:22.679
of my position and because of what I've done and who I am, I'm gonna be in this

00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:27.719
place. And the Lord pardoned this thing. And there's sensitivity on the part of

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:32.959
this man Naaman because of what he understands and how he's purposing to

00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:39.279
worship Jehovah only. And he said unto him, that's Elisha replying in verse 19,

00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:44.679
go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. We know that Gehazi makes a

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:48.759
terrible decision. We won't look at the rest of the chapter, but Gehazi makes a

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:54.279
terrible decision in seeking to get one of those gifts. And we find that he not

00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:59.599
only received a gift, but he got leprosy as a result of that. And you can look at

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:03.479
the end of the chapter and read that. But this morning as we look here at this

00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:12.159
situation, this proclamation of Naaman, this morning, how did Naaman learn about

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:21.919
God? Started with a little unnamed servant girl. Listen, this morning it's

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:28.959
not about our names being known. It's about the Lord God being exalted. There

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:37.959
are some people of God throughout the history of the church that are recognizable

00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:43.239
by name. But you know what's very interesting to me is that so often we hear

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:48.079
the names of maybe a C.H. Spurgeon, maybe we hear the names of a D.L. Moody, we hear

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:52.799
the names of an Adoniram Judson or a Hudson Taylor. And you can go through the

00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:57.959
list and you can name some people that you would be familiar with of those that

00:39:57.959 --> 00:40:00.319
God used in a great way. But what's often...

00:40:00.319 --> 00:40:07.059
and not known are the people that led those people to Christ.

00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:09.899
It's very rare that you hear their names.

00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:10.899
Why?

00:40:10.899 --> 00:40:11.899
Because it doesn't really matter.

00:40:11.899 --> 00:40:15.139
In fact, the names of those other people that I mentioned don't really matter either.

00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:18.739
It's all about the Lord Jesus Christ being exalted.

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:22.859
But this morning, if we'd come to a place in our own lives where I think this little

00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:27.779
maid was, where it's like, listen, I'm just a servant of the Lord God Almighty.

00:40:27.779 --> 00:40:35.599
No matter where I am, no matter where I am, no matter what the circumstances are that

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:41.639
brought me to the place where I am, my duty is to make Christ known.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:47.299
And it doesn't really matter who knows who I am, because God knows who I am and I'm seeking

00:40:47.299 --> 00:40:54.939
to simply exalt His name and to let others know about my God.

00:40:54.939 --> 00:40:58.839
And then I want you to think about Naaman just for a moment.

00:40:58.839 --> 00:41:01.639
And I want you to think about what Naaman experienced.

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:07.319
And as we've sought this morning to make application, I understand contextually that he was healed

00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:12.279
of leprosy and that that's his experience, but then he recognized that there's only one

00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:14.239
God and that's Jehovah.

00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:17.359
And he purposes to worship Him alone.

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:19.359
His life was changed.

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:24.159
If we're to use New Testament vernacular this morning, we'd say that he was born again,

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:25.659
that he's changed.

00:41:25.659 --> 00:41:28.179
He is a new creature.

00:41:28.179 --> 00:41:31.779
That's the terminology we'd use as New Testament believers this morning as we look at this

00:41:31.779 --> 00:41:33.139
text of scripture.

00:41:33.139 --> 00:41:37.059
And I would say to you this morning that after he experienced what he experienced, do you

00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:41.939
see how boldly he exclaimed what he exclaimed?

00:41:41.939 --> 00:41:43.819
Listen, he didn't care.

00:41:43.819 --> 00:41:48.819
The Bible tells us that when he came back to the house of Elisha in verse 15, notice

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:53.859
the Bible says that he returned to the man of God, he, and notice this, and all his company.

00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:59.959
He didn't go back to Elisha secretly and make his proclamation.

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:04.479
Everyone that came from Syria with him were there and he still stood and proclaimed.

00:42:04.479 --> 00:42:05.479
Why?

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:06.479
Because he knew something.

00:42:06.479 --> 00:42:07.859
He says, now I know.

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.759
I'm convinced of.

00:42:09.759 --> 00:42:13.799
And this morning I wonder as we look at our own lives and begin to think about Naaman

00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:23.279
and looking at this passage of scripture and the freshness, the newness of what's happened.

00:42:23.939 --> 00:42:29.019
If we're not careful, we can become like the church at Ephesus where we've lost our first

00:42:29.019 --> 00:42:30.619
love.

00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:34.499
We can get in that place where we've just kind of gotten used to.

00:42:34.499 --> 00:42:39.859
We've kind of gotten a little cold, if you will, gotten a little indifferent, if you

00:42:39.859 --> 00:42:40.859
will.

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:45.779
We've believed the lie of the enemy that nobody wants to hear.

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:54.159
It's kind of, it's not as fresh as it was when it first happened.

00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:56.559
Do you remember when you first got saved?

00:42:56.559 --> 00:43:02.079
Man, you first got saved, you understood, listen, let me tell you what Christ did for

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.079
me.

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:05.359
Let me tell you how He changed my life.

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:14.119
I mean, let me tell you how I was on a road leading to a Christless eternity.

00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:17.899
I had no peace and no hope and no joy.

00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:23.379
But now, as a child of God, I have, as Miss Lorene sang this morning, exceeding joy.

00:43:23.379 --> 00:43:24.379
Why?

00:43:24.379 --> 00:43:25.379
Because He is my exceeding joy.

00:43:25.379 --> 00:43:26.379
I have peace.

00:43:26.379 --> 00:43:27.379
Why?

00:43:27.379 --> 00:43:30.499
Because He is my peace and He gives me a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:43:30.499 --> 00:43:31.499
I have hope.

00:43:31.499 --> 00:43:32.499
Why?

00:43:32.499 --> 00:43:35.499
Because He is my hope and He says that He's coming back and I'm going to spend forever

00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:36.499
with Him.

00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:41.859
And begin to think about, listen, sometimes it can just kind of, if we're not careful,

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:49.319
we can kind of lose, in time, that fervency.

00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:55.079
And as I look at Naaman here, he stands and, man, he exclaims.

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.999
He didn't care who was there.

00:43:57.999 --> 00:44:00.559
He didn't care, I don't think he cared what they thought.

00:44:00.559 --> 00:44:09.759
And this morning, I wonder, as we look at an example of Naaman, how are we doing on

00:44:09.759 --> 00:44:14.579
proclaiming how great our God is, declaring how great our God is?

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:20.339
Listen, I believe this morning, with every fiber of my being, that those of you that

00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:24.259
are gathered here this morning, that each of us that are here, that we've discovered

00:44:24.259 --> 00:44:29.099
God's greatness, that we could stand and we could testify of how great God is.

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:31.179
We can sing the songs.

00:44:31.179 --> 00:44:34.139
We could give the answers.

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:37.699
If someone were to say, right on a list, five reasons that God is great, I think we could

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:42.399
all at least do five.

00:44:42.399 --> 00:44:45.719
Extra credit, we could put more down, right?

00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:52.639
But I wonder this morning, I ask myself, I ask you to ask yourself, in closing, how am

00:44:52.639 --> 00:44:59.039
I doing not in simply knowing that God is great, but how am I doing in declaring that

00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:00.879
God is great?

00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:04.619
In letting other people know how great my God is.

00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:09.959
Naaman, he had an expectation.

00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:15.059
He didn't get what he expected at the first go, but then he had an experience.

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:16.819
He humbled himself.

00:45:16.819 --> 00:45:24.039
He obeyed what the man of God said, and he was clean, man.

00:45:24.039 --> 00:45:27.939
And then he exclaimed, now I know.

00:45:27.939 --> 00:45:29.939
There's no God in all the earth, but in Israel.

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:32.319
Notice he's speaking of the Lord God Jehovah.

00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:40.399
He's the only God, and I'm so thankful that this morning we get to live in a place knowing

00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:45.839
the God of the Bible, and being able to make Him known to others.

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:46.839
Let's pray.

00:45:46.839 --> 00:45:47.839
Father, we love you.

00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:48.839
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:53.799
We thank you for this Bible account.

00:45:53.799 --> 00:45:59.399
We can look at the events and we can rejoice in what took place, but as we make application

00:45:59.399 --> 00:46:06.819
in our lives, I pray that we'd humbly search our own hearts.

00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:12.459
Father, maybe there's someone here this morning that has never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:46:12.459 --> 00:46:13.859
as their personal Savior.

00:46:13.859 --> 00:46:15.539
Maybe they've not humbled themselves.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:21.339
Maybe they're still leaning on their own understanding.

00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:30.119
Maybe they're believing some other teaching with regard to the way of salvation that would

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:33.559
not be in agreement with what You said in Your Word.

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:37.879
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:43.279
That they'd understand, they'd humble themselves, that they'd obey what the Word of God says.

00:46:43.279 --> 00:46:49.139
For by grace, through faith, alone, Christ alone.

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:53.039
It's not Christ in my works, it's Christ alone.

00:46:53.039 --> 00:46:56.799
If righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

00:46:56.799 --> 00:46:59.599
We know that our Savior did not die in vain.

00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:04.519
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray that today would be the day of their

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:06.559
salvation.

00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:13.319
For every person that knows You as their Lord and Savior, God, I pray that we'd evaluate

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:20.939
our lives, not with regard specifically to knowing how great You are, but that we'd evaluate

00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:26.939
our lives specifically with regard to declaring how great You are.

00:47:26.939 --> 00:47:30.019
I pray, God, that You'd use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

00:47:30.019 --> 00:47:34.619
I pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way in every

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:40.299
life and every heart, Lord, that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:47:40.299 --> 00:47:42.419
We'll give You the honor and glory for that which You'll do.

00:47:42.419 --> 00:47:43.719
It's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:43.719 --> 00:47:44.719
Would you stand with me?

00:47:44.719 --> 00:47:45.719
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
