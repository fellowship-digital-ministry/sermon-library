WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.719
16 this evening, and as you turn to this passage of Scripture, I will say at the onset of the

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:14.960
message this evening that the content of Exodus 16 is familiar to many believers.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.360
It is here in Exodus chapter number 16 that we read about the manna that God provided

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360
for His people.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.399
And what an amazing, miraculous, just matter of provision this was for the people of God,

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.479
and we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture, that as God revealed His plan

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:42.680
to Moses, really as we see specifically in verse number 4, God said this, He said that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.200
I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or no.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.639
Isn't that interesting?

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.880
God said to Moses, here's the plan that I'm going to give.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.720
I understand the current situation.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.040
I am aware of these things.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.759
And I've heard the murmuring of the people, and here's what I'm going to do.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.239
Here's how I am going to work.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.400
But in so doing, I'm going to prove them.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.540
I'm going to prove them.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.120
He said that I may prove them whether they will walk in My law or no.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.760
As we read the passage of Scripture, we read of the record of the miraculous provision,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.519
but we also find how God would test His people.

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.080
The word prove means to test or to try.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.959
As a backdrop to the event here that's recorded in Exodus chapter number 16 and the miracle

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.080
that is here, we would certainly understand that this group of people, the children of

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.319
Israel that are living and breathing during Exodus chapter number 16, these people had

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.519
seen God work miraculously.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:59.120
These people are the very people that were in bondage in Egypt that cried out to God,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.919
and God through the series of plagues had demonstrated His power.

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:11.679
We find that they come to the Red Sea, and of course, the Red Sea is before them, and

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.880
the army of the Egyptians is behind them.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.199
And yet again, God would work miraculously and deliver them and allow them to cross the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.559
Red Sea on dry ground.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:28.160
After they sing in Exodus chapter number 15, the song of Moses is referred to, and they

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720
are jubilant and exalting the Lord for all the work that He did.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.600
We find that the chapter ends in Exodus chapter number 15 with complaining about the bitter

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.160
water of Marah.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.039
It's there that God healed the waters.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.960
And we come to chapter number 16, and again we see that this group of people that had

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:56.880
experienced and had been eyewitness of what God had done and how God had worked miraculously,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.679
that once again they're confronted with a trial, they're confronted with a problem,

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:07.119
they murmur, they complain, and God is going to supernaturally provide for them.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:11.639
But in that provision, there was a test.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:19.199
This evening, I ask myself the question, and I want you to ask yourself this question.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:26.199
It's the title of the message this evening, would you have passed the test?

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.039
Would you have passed the test?

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:37.880
The reality is that I believe that my immediate answer and maybe your immediate answer, we

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.520
would like to say, yes, absolutely, I would have passed the test.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.399
But I hope that we do some serious evaluation this evening.

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:55.720
That we would really consider and not just give an answer that's an off-the-cuff kind

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.240
of an answer, an immediate response.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.240
See, the reality is that there are times even today in our lives that God is testing us,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.479
He's proving us.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.199
And many times we don't even know it.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.720
We have no idea.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.800
It's one thing when the professor says, you're going to have a test next Thursday, and here's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.440
the content of the subject matter that will be covered on the test, and you have some

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.239
time to prepare.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.600
You're aware of it.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.359
There was a professor that we had in college, his name was Dr. Bish.

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:31.160
And he was a happy-go-lucky fella.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720
He had been a pastor for a number of years at a church, and he'd retired, and he was

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.519
teaching in Bible college, and he was a well-loved professor.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.119
He really was.

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:46.959
And he was a knowledgeable man, he was a practical man.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.959
But every once in a while, he'd walk into class, and I remember the very first time

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:55.559
he ever walked into class this way, and he walked in, and he walked in like this.

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:01.239
And you just thought he was happy, right?

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:03.559
And he says, you know what that is?

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.559
No idea.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.559
I'd never seen him do it.

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.799
He said, that's a pop test.

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:10.880
Put your books away, take out a paper and pencil.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.320
And you know what happened?

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.320
Everyone said, oh.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320
Why?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.920
I had not prepared, I had not studied, I had not planned for that test.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.440
I would submit to you this evening that the children of Israel, the congregation, Moses

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.480
understands as God says to Moses, I'm going to prove them.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.279
But the children of Israel, the people, I don't think they knew that this was a test.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.679
God was proving them.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:43.880
Notice with me in verse number one as we dig into the passage of Scripture, the Bible says

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.239
they took their journey from Elam, and all the congregation of the children of Israel

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:53.720
came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elam and Sinai, on the fifteenth day

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.200
of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.119
Now you understand, it says here, on the fifteenth day of the second month, seventy-five

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.700
days roughly, yeah?

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.040
Since they had seen great miracles in the land of Egypt, since they had crossed over

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:20.160
the Red Sea on dry land, and the Bible says in verse number two, if you're taking notes,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.839
number one, the problem.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.720
We're going to spend most of our time on the final point this evening, so that we can grab

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.959
the entire context, and verses two and three, the problem is given to us.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:36.000
The Bible says the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.320
and Aaron in the wilderness.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.720
The children of Israel said unto them, would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.359
in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:56.399
Now, many of you, if you are familiar with the Scriptures, you understand that while

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:02.200
they were in Egypt, they were complaining about the hardship of Egypt, correct?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.279
God heard their cries, right?

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.640
And now they're saying, oh, that we would have died there, it was so much better there,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.160
we sat by the flesh pots and we ate bread to the full, and so we see that they're murmuring

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.920
and we see that they have this idea that we're going to die of hunger.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.679
The end of verse number three, for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:31.720
this whole assembly with hunger.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.119
Now, not only had God miraculously delivered His people, but He had just healed the bitter

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.239
waters of Marah.

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:43.600
By the way, they thought they were going to die there, right?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.279
And God had miraculously healed those waters so that they could have drink, and then in

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:52.920
just a matter of time, now we're going to die of hunger.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.920
Isn't that amazing?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.519
To see the perspective of the children of Israel, to see the negativity.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:05.079
It is interesting to know as we look through the entirety of the passage and make note

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:11.519
of various statements that are made here throughout the passages of interest in verse number 12,

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:16.380
and we must understand this, that God knows everything.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.500
You notice that the Scriptures say that they murmured against Moses and Aaron, but really

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.420
their complaint was against God.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.420
Why?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.140
For it was God that was leading them.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.619
We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 12, God is speaking.

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:36.200
He says, I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.700
He knows everything.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.940
Amen?

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.260
He is omniscient.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:49.059
As we look at the passage of Scripture, I would readily admit that the problem that

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:50.979
they faced was a real problem.

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.659
It was a real problem.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:55.500
They did not have any food.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.780
We understand that, I believe that there was some level of exaggeration, there was some

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:06.580
despair and we find that they respond in a manner that is not appropriate, but we find

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.580
that it was a real problem.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.260
Listen, we face real problems in life.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.859
I would submit to you this evening that the Red Sea was a real problem for the children

00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:15.020
of Israel.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.419
I would submit to you this evening that the bitter waters of Morrow was a real problem

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:24.780
for the children of Israel, just as this situation was a real problem that they faced.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.780
We face problems, but we have a God who is able.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:35.940
The same God who handled the Red Sea, the same God who handled Pharaoh's army, the same

00:09:36.099 --> 00:09:42.299
God who healed those bitter waters, certainly He is able to provide food.

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:44.900
Amen?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.059
So we see the provision, number two, the provision.

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:52.859
We see the problem, but we find that the provision in verses 4 and 5, and then we'll skip down

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:58.179
and read a few verses later in the passage, but we find that with the provision came some

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:00.179
instruction.

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:01.379
Verse number four, the Bible says,

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:02.879
then said the Lord unto Moses,

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:06.379
behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:07.759
Isn't that amazing?

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.819
I mean, just pause and just think about that.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:12.519
See, here's the problem sometimes in our own lives

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:15.219
is that we know about manna.

00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:17.019
Right? We know, oh yeah, they had manna.

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:18.819
In fact, many of us could talk about

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.619
the fact that they had it for 40 years.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.379
We know at the end of the passage it talks about that.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:25.219
As soon as they entered into the land of promise,

00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:28.079
the manna ceased and they ate from the fruit of the land.

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:31.119
And we studied that as we went through the book of Joshua.

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:35.119
But can you imagine being there?

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.479
God said, I'm gonna rain bread from heaven.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.839
This is not a normal thing.

00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:43.399
It's a miraculous thing.

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:45.479
God is showing His power.

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:48.679
God is showing His ability to care for His people.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:50.439
And we find that the Bible says

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:54.359
that He would rain bread from heaven for you.

00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:56.559
And notice it says, and the people shall go out

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.879
and gather a certain rate every year,

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.239
every day, excuse me,

00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:03.399
that I may prove them

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:06.519
whether they will walk in my law or no.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.939
And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day,

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.759
they shall prepare that which they bring in

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:16.279
and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.359
And Moses and Aaron said,

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:19.239
and all the children of Israel even,

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:22.139
that ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.299
from the land of Egypt and in the morning,

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:26.939
then ye shall see the glory of the Lord

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:29.379
for that He heareth your murmurings against the Lord

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:33.099
and what are we that ye murmur against us?

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:35.359
And Moses said, this shall be

00:11:35.359 --> 00:11:37.899
when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:39.539
and in the morning bread to the full

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:41.339
for that the Lord heareth your murmurings

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:43.139
which you murmur against Him.

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:43.979
And what are we?

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:46.879
Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:50.219
And Moses spake unto Aaron in verse nine,

00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:52.299
saying to all the congregation of the children of Israel,

00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:54.019
come near before the Lord

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:55.339
for He hath heard your murmurings

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:56.979
and it came to pass as Aaron spake

00:11:56.979 --> 00:11:59.319
unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:00.859
that they looked toward the wilderness

00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:03.019
and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.859
and the Lord spake unto Moses saying,

00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:07.779
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.339
Notice what he says that he's going to do.

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:10.899
He says, speak unto them saying,

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:14.699
at even ye shall eat flesh

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:19.539
and in the morning, you shall be filled with bread.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.819
Remember what they said when they complained.

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.619
They said that they were in Egypt

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.299
and they sat by the flesh pots

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:28.379
and they did eat bread to the full.

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:31.500
God said, at even ye shall eat flesh

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.459
and in the morning, you shall be filled with bread.

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:35.179
Notice the end of verse number 12.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:40.099
And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

00:12:40.099 --> 00:12:41.619
Not only does He know everything,

00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:44.259
but He desires for us to know Him.

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:47.899
He desires for us to know Him.

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:52.019
He desires that we would know what He is capable of doing.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.659
He desires that we would trust Him,

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:56.859
that we would fully rely upon Him,

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:59.219
that we would live by faith,

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:00.419
that we would obey Him.

00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:04.259
We find the Bible tells us in verse number 13,

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:05.259
and it came to pass,

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:08.139
isn't that a wonderful statement in Scripture?

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:14.099
And it came to pass that at even,

00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:17.979
the quails came up and covered the camp.

00:13:17.979 --> 00:13:22.939
And in the morning, the dew lay round about the host.

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:25.539
That phrase in Scripture that you often find,

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:27.059
it came to pass,

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:30.099
is a comforting reminder

00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:33.259
that everything that God says, He will do.

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:37.539
He promised that He would provide for His people

00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:40.059
and He gives the instruction to Moses

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:41.739
as to how He will do it.

00:13:41.739 --> 00:13:44.419
And then the Bible says it came to pass.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:46.979
He does what He says He will do.

00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.099
He's never failed and He never will.

00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:51.379
Amen?

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:52.419
And we find that, listen,

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:55.939
the reality is that He may not provide for you or me

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:58.379
the way that we think He should,

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.819
but He always does right.

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:03.699
His way is perfect.

00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:05.059
Amen?

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:06.899
And we find here in verse number 14, it says,

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.899
and when the dew that lay was gone up,

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:11.219
behold, upon the face of the wilderness,

00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:13.939
there lay a small round thing,

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:15.899
as small as the hoarfrost on the ground.

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:19.220
And when the children of Israel saw it,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.139
they said one to another,

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:23.859
it is manna.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.739
For they wist not what it was.

00:14:27.739 --> 00:14:29.179
And Moses said unto them,

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:34.179
this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:38.579
In verse number 35 of the passage of Scripture,

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:40.539
the Bible says, and the children of Israel

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:42.859
did eat manna 40 years.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.979
It's interesting that in just a little while,

00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:48.899
they would be complaining about the manna.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:51.259
In fact, it was an often complaint

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:52.660
of the children of Israel.

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:55.619
They didn't like the way that God had provided for them.

00:14:55.619 --> 00:14:57.859
They loathe this bread.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.299
Right? That's what they said.

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:02.859
And the reality is that God

00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:05.059
had miraculously provided for them

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:08.739
and they would eat this manna for 40 years.

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:11.899
I mentioned that with the provision came instruction

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:14.539
and that's where we come to our final point this evening.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.820
And that is the proving.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.940
We see the problem, we see the provision,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.739
but we see the proving.

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:21.259
This is where I want to spend the remainder

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:22.979
of our time this evening.

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:24.259
Remember in verse number four,

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:26.619
that as God was revealing to Moses

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:27.940
what it was that He would do,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.539
He says that I may prove them

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:34.619
whether they will walk in My law or no.

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:37.500
Remember the title in which we've used this evening

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.619
for our message,

00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:43.579
would you have passed the test?

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:46.179
As we look at this proving

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:49.940
and we understand what God was proving them about,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.899
the testing, the trying,

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:54.220
it was whether or not they would walk in His law.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.539
It was really, it was a test of faith.

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:59.859
It was a test of obedience.

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:02.579
Are you going to believe me?

00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:05.059
Are you going to obey me?

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:07.100
Right? I mean, that's really what the test is.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.579
That's how God is proving His people

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.139
here in Exodus chapter 16.

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.779
And I would submit to you this evening

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:15.459
that God continues to prove His people.

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:17.539
In fact, before the feeding of the 5,000,

00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:22.539
He says that Jesus asked this question to prove Him.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.820
For He Himself already knew what He would do.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.019
Remember what the sight answer is

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:30.820
of the disciples on that particular day?

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.699
200 penny worth isn't enough

00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:34.779
that each would just have a little, right?

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.019
We don't have enough.

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:40.459
The mindset of the disciples was to send them away.

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:42.179
Right?

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:46.059
God said He asked this question to prove Him.

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:48.019
This evening as we look at this proving

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:50.100
and really we would say that the test

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.820
is a test of faith, it's a test of obedience.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.380
Will we believe God?

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.259
That's what faith is, taking God at His word.

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:02.299
Believing God.

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:05.100
Will we obey God?

00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:07.220
If we disobey God, it really reveals

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.220
that we don't believe God.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.100
Would you agree with that?

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.019
If we don't obey Him,

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:17.739
it's really revealing that we don't believe Him.

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:19.220
We don't believe that He will do

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.179
what He said He will do.

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:26.259
We find in the passage of Scripture

00:17:26.259 --> 00:17:28.660
that some passed the test.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.459
Isn't that good?

00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:32.139
Some passed.

00:17:32.139 --> 00:17:33.539
The Bible actually records for us

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:35.940
in v. 16 as we get some of the instruction,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.940
this is the thing which the Lord had commanded,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.899
hath commanded,

00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:40.820
gather of it every man according to his eating,

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.100
an omer for every man according to the number of your persons.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.619
Take ye every man for them which are in his tents.

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.579
And the children of Israel did so.

00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:50.459
And gathered some more, some less.

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:52.899
And when they did meet it with an omer,

00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:55.899
he that gathered much had nothing over

00:17:55.899 --> 00:17:58.019
and he that gathered little had no lack.

00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:00.979
They gathered every man according to his eating.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:05.940
And Moses said, let no man leave of it till the morning.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.699
So there's some instruction.

00:18:07.699 --> 00:18:10.660
We find that there are some that passed the test.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.179
We're going to skip down

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:14.100
to read of some that passed the test

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.139
because the very next verse shares with us

00:18:16.139 --> 00:18:18.179
about some that failed the test.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:21.100
So skip down with me and look in v. 24.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.539
And really, let's back up to v. 23

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:25.579
because this is dealing with the sixth day

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:28.299
and the fact that they were to gather a double portion.

00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:29.859
We saw that in v. 5

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.580
when God had initially given the instruction to Moses.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.779
Moses then gives it to the people in v. 22.

00:18:35.779 --> 00:18:38.179
And it came to pass that on the sixth day,

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:40.380
they gathered twice as much bread.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.539
Two omers for one man

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:43.020
and all the rulers of the congregation

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.099
came and told Moses and he said unto them,

00:18:45.099 --> 00:18:47.460
this is that which the Lord hath said.

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:51.460
Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.059
Bake that which you will bake today

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:54.739
and see that you will see.

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:56.539
Then that which remaineth over,

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:59.020
lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.739
Now until the sixth day,

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.419
what happened with anything that you left over?

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.140
It stank.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.979
Grew worms, right?

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:09.940
We'll read it in just a moment.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.020
You can see that in v. 20.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.859
The Bible tells us that that's what happened.

00:19:16.859 --> 00:19:20.339
And so we find that here they come to that sixth day

00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:22.940
and the Bible tells us in v. 24,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.940
and they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade.

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:31.299
And I love the rest of the verse.

00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:34.659
And it did not stink.

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:39.219
Neither was there any worm therein.

00:19:40.219 --> 00:19:41.059
They obeyed God.

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:44.059
They passed the test.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.739
Can I tell you that on that first week,

00:19:47.739 --> 00:19:51.140
that first sixth day,

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.419
what would you have done?

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:58.219
You knew that on day number one, two, three, four, or five,

00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:00.820
anyone within the congregation, and by the...

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:08.220
way, there were some that did store it up, that it stank and it bred worms. What

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:16.340
would you have done? So if I store it up on day four, it spoils, it stinks, it bred

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:24.580
worms. But on day number six, God said store it up. Am I gonna pass the test or

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:32.500
I'm gonna fail the test? Am I going to believe God? Am I going to obey God? Amen?

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:39.420
Listen, I believe on the second week it would have been a lot easier to store up.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:47.260
Right? Why? Because you saw what happened. Correct? But I'm talking about the first

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:55.540
week. I'm talking about the first sixth day. What would we have done? Would we have

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:01.540
believed God? Would I have believed God? Again, as I said by way of introduction,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:08.100
I'd love to say yes, absolutely. I would have done exactly what God said. But would

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:21.820
I have? Would you? Do I? Do you? The Bible says, as we continue to look at those that

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.540
passed the test in verse 25, and Moses said, eat that today, for today is a Sabbath unto

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:33.860
the Lord. Today ye shall not find it in the field. They had provision that day. Why? Because

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:42.580
they exercised faith. Because they obeyed God. They believed God and they obeyed God.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.260
And therefore they had provision. Isn't that wonderful? Again, we're familiar with Exodus

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.940
16. We're familiar with manna. We are familiar with most of the text of Scripture and we

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.980
understand what's going on. But I wonder this evening when we really break down and consider

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:03.500
the proving aspect of this passage of Scripture and we find that God says yes, there's a problem

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:10.620
and yes, I can provide, but I'm going to prove them whether they will walk in my law

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:20.180
or no. Will they believe me? Will they obey me? Some passed the test. Aren't you thankful

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.420
for that? I'm thankful for those that have gone before us that have walked by faith,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:31.900
that have obeyed the Lord and His word, that have lived a life of obedience. We sing the

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:37.780
song. In fact, we sang it Sunday evening after we had the baptisms. Trust and obey. That's

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:46.420
faith and obedience. Believing what God said and obeying Him. And here we find that there

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.660
were some that passed the test. Unfortunately, there were some that failed the test. Go back

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.860
to verse number 20. There were some that failed in those first five days. We don't know exactly

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.860
which day it was, but we do see that the Bible says notwithstanding in verse number 20, they

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.820
hearken not unto Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning. Now let me ask you,

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.780
why would they leave it until the morning? They didn't believe it was going to come tomorrow.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.660
Why else would you leave it until the morning? You don't believe it's going to come. Or you're

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.460
lazy and you don't want to go get it. I mean, that's the only other option I could think

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.380
of. If you can think of other options, I'm more than happy to hear them, but the only

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.420
two options I could think of is one, they don't believe it's going to be there, or two,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.820
they're too lazy to go get it tomorrow. So they say, I'm going to store it up. I believe

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.940
that most likely it was reason number one that was what they were guilty of is that

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.420
they didn't believe it would be there the next day. Why? Because it's a test of faith.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:46.540
It's a test of obedience. And so what do they do? Well, they gather more and they store

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:52.500
it up. And the Bible says in verse number 20, that those people that did not hearken

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.100
unto Moses, that they, uh, they stored it up. They left it until the morning that it

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:06.500
bred worms and stank and Moses was wroth with them. Now, let me ask you a question. Was the

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:15.180
instruction difficult? It's not hard, right? God says, I'm going to rain. I'm going to,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:20.660
I'm going to send, here's what I'm going to do. Uh, I am going to rain bread from heaven

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.300
for you, but here's the instruction on day one through five, you gather this amount,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.100
you don't store it up. You're going to have to get it on day one. You have your provision

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.380
and then next day too, you have your provision. But on day number six, you're going to gather

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:40.899
twice as much a double portion as opposed to, it's not hard instruction. I would submit

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:46.300
to you this evening that most of the instruction in God's word really isn't hard. It really

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:55.020
isn't. It's not hard. It's not challenging. It's not difficult from a, uh, if we're going

00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:00.380
to put it on a scale of difficulty from one to 10, it's not breaking the scale on difficulty.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:08.020
This was pretty simple instruction, but it required faith and it required obedience.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:19.020
But remember as God's people, the just shall live by faith. Hebrews 11 six without faith,

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:26.420
it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:34.500
that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him without faith. It is impossible to

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:43.660
please him. But living by sight is so much easier, but living by faith is such a blessing

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.540
because we get to see what God can do. By the way, these people that live by sight,

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:54.300
they found out in a hurry it wasn't easier because it bred worms and stank. Now the same

00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:03.600
group of people that failed the test on day number six, they were to gather a double portion,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.360
but perhaps they say, well, I know what happened to these guys over here and they stored up

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:16.360
a double portion a couple of days ago and it stank and bred worms. And so I'm going

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.880
to take my chances and I'm going to go try on the seventh day to find my provision because

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.040
the Bible tells us in verse number 27 and it came to pass that there went out some of

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.360
the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none. Why did they go gather

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.320
on the seventh day? Because they didn't store up a double portion, right? If they had stored

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.279
up a double portion, if they had followed, if they had believed God, if they had obeyed

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:43.720
God, there would be no reason for them to go out on the seventh day to try to gather.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.679
They would have had their provision. Those that passed the test in verse number 24 and

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:52.920
25, they had the provision for that seventh day. Moses said, that's what you eat. That's

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.160
your provision. And so there's a group of people. We don't know. It says some of the

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.760
people that they go out on the seventh day, they go to gather and they find none. And

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:11.480
I want you to notice what God says in verse 28. The Lord said unto Moses, how long refuse

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:19.580
ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.160
Therefore he giveth you on the sixth day, the bread of two days. Abide ye every man

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:32.279
in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:42.480
the seventh day. I'm not interested in speaking about the 39 years and 51 weeks of manna.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:50.480
I'm interested mostly with the first week because that's when the test was initially

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:57.080
given. Again, on that second week, it would have been easy to learn from what happened

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:06.559
on week number one. But I wonder in week number one, what would I have done? I ask you to

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:16.119
ask the same question. What would I have done? I'm there. I'm an Israelite. I've experienced

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:20.580
these things that have happened and we have no food. We think that we're going to die

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.679
of hunger and God says here's what he's going to do. It's something that I've never seen

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:33.559
happen before. God gives instruction with this miraculous provision. Would I, would

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:47.479
you have passed the test? Some did. Glory to God. Some failed. I wonder this evening

00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:54.200
in my life, in your life, how is God proving us? How is God proving us? How is he testing

00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:03.600
us? How is he trying us? What is it that he's laid before us to see? Are they really

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:10.039
going to believe me? Is my child, are they really going to believe me? Are they going

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:18.160
to obey me? This evening I wonder, am I walking in his ways? Remember, that's what God said.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:26.320
He said that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no. What I say this

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:34.200
evening, not pridefully, but I say this evening that I'm living by faith. That I'm believing

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:40.760
what God said in his word. That I'm believing that he said I will never leave thee nor forsake

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:47.520
thee. That I'm believing that he will provide for me. That he will take care of my needs.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:55.760
That he is the Lord God Omnipotent. Am I believing his word? And am I obeying his word? Am I

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.679
living a life of obedience? See this evening,

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:02.879
We have the privilege of reading

00:30:02.879 --> 00:30:07.239
of an account that took place thousands of years ago

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:11.279
in seeking to learn from history.

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:13.719
To learn from this event

00:30:13.719 --> 00:30:16.399
in the nation of Israel's history

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:20.159
after they had miraculously crossed over the Red Sea

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.979
and they now are in this position

00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:24.279
where they have no food

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:26.579
and they think they're going to die of hunger.

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:27.779
And we have the privilege

00:30:27.779 --> 00:30:30.839
because God has given us His recorded Word.

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:33.359
He has preserved it for us

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:36.459
that we can see they had a test.

00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:38.199
Some passed it.

00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:39.959
Some failed.

00:30:39.959 --> 00:30:43.199
And this evening, if we could put ourselves

00:30:43.199 --> 00:30:46.399
into the account,

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:50.639
would we have passed the test?

00:30:50.639 --> 00:30:52.439
I believe this evening each of us,

00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:54.759
you probably would say with me,

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:57.819
I'd love to just immediately say, absolutely.

00:30:57.819 --> 00:31:02.939
I would have done it exactly like you said.

00:31:02.939 --> 00:31:07.339
But I think it's important that we really examine

00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:09.779
and say, well, what about today?

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:11.899
It's easy for us to look back at the children of Israel

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:12.979
and say, oh, I wouldn't have done that.

00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:15.739
Oh, I would have done that.

00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:18.539
But today, am I living by faith?

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:21.339
Am I living a life of obedience?

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:24.999
Am I doing that which pleases the Lord?

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:28.039
Remember, without faith, it's impossible to please Him.

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:31.879
He wants His children to be different.

00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:35.359
We live by faith, not by sight.

00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:36.799
Amen?

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.759
This evening, as we look at this familiar passage

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:40.639
of Scripture in Exodus 16,

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:42.079
I think the Lord challenges me

00:31:42.079 --> 00:31:44.519
and I hope He's challenging you.

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.879
Would we have passed the test?

00:31:46.879 --> 00:31:47.719
Let's pray.

00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:49.179
Father, we love You.

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:52.319
We thank You for loving us.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:54.719
We thank You that You are the Lord God Omnipotent.

00:31:54.719 --> 00:31:57.719
We thank You that You do all things well.

00:31:57.719 --> 00:32:00.959
That You always do that which You say You will do.

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:02.519
And this evening, as we take a few moments

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:04.599
to examine this passage of Scripture

00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:06.639
and to consider the events

00:32:06.639 --> 00:32:11.559
that the children of Israel experienced,

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:17.039
two and a half months after leaving Egypt,

00:32:17.059 --> 00:32:19.659
they were given a test.

00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:21.659
Some passed.

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:25.339
Some failed.

00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:27.779
God, I believe that even as You tested

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:30.299
and proved the children of Israel,

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:34.379
that You still prove Your people today.

00:32:34.379 --> 00:32:36.619
God, You want us to live a life of faith,

00:32:36.619 --> 00:32:40.659
a life of obedience.

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:43.179
In Numbers 14, as the children of Israel

00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:49.359
have doubted with that evil report of the ten spies,

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:54.879
You give us insight with regard

00:32:54.879 --> 00:32:56.479
to Your desire for Your people.

00:32:56.479 --> 00:33:02.479
How long will it be ere they believe Me?

00:33:02.479 --> 00:33:04.599
God, help us to be like Paul.

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:06.879
I believe God.

00:33:06.879 --> 00:33:08.959
Help us to live a life of faith

00:33:08.959 --> 00:33:11.439
and a life of obedience,

00:33:11.459 --> 00:33:15.179
believing that You are who You say You are

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:17.979
and You will do what You said You will do.

00:33:17.979 --> 00:33:22.299
Help us not to be influenced by this culture,

00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:28.859
by the ideologies that permeate our society.

00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:31.659
Help us to obey that which we find in Romans 12,

00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:35.179
that we would not be conformed to this world.

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:39.139
God, that You would help us to have a biblical worldview

00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:41.439
that You would help us to live by faith,

00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:45.679
simply trusting, believing You.

00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:46.919
I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:49.159
We thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:50.239
I pray that You'd be glorified

00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:51.479
through the remainder of our service,

00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:53.919
and it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
