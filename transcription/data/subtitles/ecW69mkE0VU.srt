1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,519
last time, so it's been a while since we're here.

2
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:04,960
We were supposed to be here back during COVID.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,039
And of course, because of COVID, we weren't able to come

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,760
and we had to cancel out the meeting

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,399
that we had scheduled then.

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:15,439
So the Lord was gracious to let us come this year in 2023.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,879
And I tell you, it's good to be here, amen?

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,399
In fact, at this point in life, it's good to be anywhere.

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,120
So I'm just thankful for the opportunity to be back here

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,280
in Virginia once again, in beautiful Oakton.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,319
And we've been getting around a little bit,

12
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,799
my cousin and his wife live just south of here.

13
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,720
And so we went down and visited with them yesterday

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,560
for a little while.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,720
They've lived here for quite some time,

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,680
so it's good to see them.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,360
So it's having family near you was a bonus.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,400
So getting to spend time with people we don't see

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,919
on a regular basis was a joy.

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,200
I'll be introducing us in the morning service

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,319
a little bit more, you pray for me.

22
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,759
I woke up this morning with a slight cold

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,439
and I thought yesterday it was allergies

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,520
and I told them then, if I get a cold,

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,639
a lot of times I lose my voice.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,279
And I preached a missions conference

27
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,400
where I had to hold the mic at my mouth all week long.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,840
I mean, I held up here, it felt so bad,

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,440
I told the pastor, I don't want my love offering,

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,199
you can keep it because I feel bad

31
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,680
that I wasn't able to do my normal preaching.

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,040
And he said, listen, he said, you know,

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,440
God can still use your squeaky voice, amen?

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,080
And so I had a good missions conference,

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,559
I had a good faith promise commitment

36
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,900
and took on some more missionaries, including us.

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,819
And so God blessed us in a great way

38
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,919
during the course of that meeting.

39
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,919
So you pray for me that I keep my voice

40
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,400
during the course of the week.

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,080
If you've not met us before, this is my wife, Linda,

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,279
I'll have her stand very quickly.

43
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,760
The Bible said, who so fond of the wife

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,160
finds the good thing and obtain a favor of the Lord, amen?

45
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,680
We've been married 58 years now, gone 59.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,879
God's been gracious to give us long life together

47
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,879
and just mentioned bladder cancer, I've had it twice now.

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,120
So I know what it's like to go through the surgery

49
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,879
and I've had other cancers as well.

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,699
So God's kept me going in spite of all that.

51
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,000
And so I'm thankful for it.

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,559
But we've been on the road now and revival work now,

53
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:00,360
31 years, I pastored 14 years in the San Diego area.

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,279
And we've enjoyed our ministry,

55
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,099
but we're getting a little bit older now.

56
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,400
So traveling is getting harder.

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,160
So it was always difficult for us to get on planes

58
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,360
and fly to different places.

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
And of course, we drive quite a bit.

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,839
And in fact, we finished this meeting,

61
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,919
we go to Harrisonburg for a meeting

62
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,960
and be down there next week.

63
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,320
And then we fly back to San Diego

64
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,820
and then we're in the car four days later,

65
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,880
driving to Missouri for meetings there.

66
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,559
And then we'll be coming up in the Minnesota

67
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,679
and down through South Dakota.

68
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,839
So it's getting a little bit rougher.

69
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,320
I was saying to Brother Sommerdorf yesterday,

70
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,000
saw his big RV out there.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,960
We had an RV, but we got to the point

72
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,559
where it was getting too difficult for us to use it.

73
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,199
Get a little bit older, it's harder to set it up

74
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,160
and tear it down every week.

75
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
We had a fifth wheel.

76
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,360
And so we get out of that and we've been just using our car

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,160
and our RV or SUV and now I'm flying as well.

78
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
But good to be with you.

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
We'll be talking a bit more about revival

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,179
during the course of the week.

81
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,839
Now, revive us again that thy people may rejoice

82
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,559
in thee, Psalm 85, six.

83
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,860
Now, in a revival meeting,

84
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,000
one of the things that's most important is prayer.

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,399
And we had some prayer yesterday,

86
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,559
but we need to continue to pray that God would work

87
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,000
during the course of the week.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,940
Now, listen friends, I'll tell you,

89
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,000
we desperately need revival in America.

90
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:15,320
But we need it in our Bible believing churches.

91
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,839
I said, I told them yesterday,

92
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,679
judgment must begin at the house of God.

93
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:22,919
We have got to have a time in our churches in America

94
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,080
where we recognize the importance of revival

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,660
within the local New Testament church.

96
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,240
Now, I have had the blessing of seeing revivals take place

97
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,199
in churches over the years.

98
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,160
But I will say this, I've not seen much,

99
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I've not seen much of a revival spirit in recent years.

100
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,460
Seems like there's been more of a resistance,

101
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,360
more of a hindering spirit.

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,600
People refusing to get right with God.

103
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,279
People refusing to confess their sin and repent

104
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,520
and turn from their wicked ways.

105
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,720
I mean, that's become a real problem.

106
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,759
There is a simple formula for revival, it's this,

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,720
and of course we see it in 2 Chronicles 7, 14,

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,160
and they say, well, now, Brother Meshon,

109
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
you know that was given to the children of Israel,

110
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,339
but as a practical application to us today,

111
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,259
if my people, which are called by my name,

112
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,179
number one, will humble themselves.

113
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,240
Now, there's a concept.

114
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,160
Will humble themselves and pray, amen,

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,959
and seek my face.

116
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,760
Now, hear this, and turn from their wicked ways.

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,320
He's not talking to the world there,

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,279
he's talking to his people.

119
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,959
Turn from their wicked ways.

120
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,079
He said, if you'll do that, those four things.

121
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,920
Now, those four things are not the result of revival,

122
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,559
it's what brings revival.

123
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,920
It's what invites revival.

124
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,079
That's not the fruit of revival, it's what brings revival.

125
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,799
That's the formula for revival, four things.

126
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,679
So if you do that, he said, listen, I'll answer your prayer,

127
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,679
I'll forgive your sins, I'll heal your land.

128
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,440
And I've said this for years,

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,739
the only hope America has is a revived church.

130
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,760
Unless we experience revival right here,

131
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,600
and we see God do a work here, America's done.

132
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,359
The answer's not in the White House, folks,

133
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,760
the answer's in God's house.

134
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,959
We got too busy with politics here in recent years,

135
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,359
and listen, I'll tell you what,

136
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,600
we need to understand and realize that you and I,

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
who are saved by the grace of God,

138
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,679
the Great Commission is what's most important,

139
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:20,880
first of all, winning people to Jesus Christ one by one.

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,119
But we've got to get our own household cleaned up.

141
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,359
Would you agree with that?

142
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,320
So I really do believe we need to give

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,119
some thought and consideration to that this week

144
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,359
as we go into the revival meeting.

145
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm serious about revival.

146
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,000
I wanna see revival, amen, don't you?

147
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,959
I really do, I want God to start with me.

148
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,239
And that's an important thing.

149
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,920
Haggai chapter one in your Bible today,

150
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,679
let's go to Haggai chapter one.

151
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:51,079
Haggai chapter one, a great little book,

152
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,839
one of the minor prophets write stuff

153
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,559
right between Zephaniah and Zechariah.

154
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,880
Haggai chapter one, if you have a Cambridge-wide margin

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
Bible like I do, it's on page 1002, amen?

156
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,399
I said that in a church one time,

157
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,239
the guy said, oh, I got one of those.

158
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,480
So he got right to the page.

159
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,600
Haggai chapter one, we're gonna start there,

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,119
and then we'll just move around in the Bible

161
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,239
just a bit here in the Sunday school hour.

162
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:20,079
And I guess if I were to give my Sunday school lesson

163
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,839
a topic this morning, it'd be this.

164
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,519
Self-confrontation, self-examination,

165
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,200
putting yourself on trial.

166
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,200
Every once in a while, we just need to stop

167
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,839
and we need to confront ourselves and examine ourselves

168
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,279
in light of the word of God.

169
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,679
And I thought about this the other day,

170
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:43,920
I think sometimes we're too busy examining the world,

171
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
but let me say something to your friends,

172
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,880
the world's gonna do what the world's gonna do.

173
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,359
They're just gonna do what they're gonna do.

174
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,920
They're unsaved, they're lost, they don't know Christ,

175
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,880
they don't have the word of God,

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,239
so the world's going to do what the world's gonna do.

177
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,239
We get so busy looking at the world,

178
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,679
what the world's doing, that we don't stop

179
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,440
and take time to look at ourselves.

180
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,000
That's an important thing for us to sometimes

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,239
get engaged in self-confrontation, self-examination.

182
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,760
Now, I'm not talking about introspection here,

183
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,839
and I'm not talking about contemporary mysticism

184
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,720
or contemplative mysticism and some of the stuff

185
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,959
that goes on today in some circles of churchianity.

186
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm talking about getting down and dirty with us,

187
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,799
with ourselves, and taking a hard look at ourselves.

188
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,920
And every once in a while,

189
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,959
it's good to just stop and do that.

190
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,320
But I want you to get Haggai chapter one,

191
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,959
we'll go down through just a few verses here

192
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,040
and just look at a couple of things

193
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
that God just spoke to my heart about.

194
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,559
Personally, my wife actually pointed this out to me,

195
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,079
and I went back and I studied this whole book.

196
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,559
And by the way, it's a post-exilic book,

197
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,600
and of course, there's four of them.

198
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,079
It's Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, and Joel,

199
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,760
four post-exilic books, and this is one of them.

200
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,239
And it was when Cyrus gave the grant

201
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,920
to the children of Israel to reestablish

202
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,839
and rebuild the temple.

203
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,480
We see that back in the book of Ezra.

204
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,600
We see specifically what it says in Ezra chapter four.

205
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
We're gonna find out that when their adversaries

206
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,200
came against them, they left off building the temple.

207
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,839
And for 14 years, the work remained dormant.

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,799
And God was not really pleased with that.

209
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,040
And of course, we know that Artaxerxes

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,000
gave a mandate that they were stopped doing it

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,440
because of the lies, the false things

212
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
that were being said about them

213
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
and what their agenda was and what their desires were

214
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,119
and their purposes were.

215
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,720
So they left off building the temple

216
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,480
when they should have just continued on at some point.

217
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
So talk about that as we get into this.

218
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,280
But in Haggai chapter one, beginning in verse one,

219
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,479
I read this, in the second year of Darius the king

220
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,479
in the sixth month, that was Elal in the Hebrew calendar.

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,440
It's September in the lunar calendar.

222
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,840
In the first day of the month came the word of the Lord

223
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,400
by Haggai, the prophet of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,

224
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,440
governor of Judah and to Joshua, the son of Josedek,

225
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,159
the high priest saying,

226
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,679
thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying,

227
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,359
this people say, now watch this,

228
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,679
this people say, the time has not come,

229
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,400
the time that the Lord's house should be built.

230
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,320
And of course, you can go back to reference it back

231
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,640
to Ezra chapter four in verse 24

232
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,799
to see what all was taking place there, the whole dynamic.

233
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,880
He said, they said, listen, the people say,

234
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,320
the time has not come,

235
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,159
the time that the Lord's house should be built.

236
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,919
But look in verse three,

237
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,280
then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet saying,

238
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,559
well, is it time for you?

239
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,500
Oh, ye to dwell in your sealed houses

240
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,239
and this house lie waste.

241
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,719
God says, what about me?

242
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,080
He said, you guys are so busy building your own houses,

243
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
building your own mansions

244
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,359
that you've forgotten about my house.

245
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:44,719
He said, listen, you need to get back to building my house.

246
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,200
It's important for you to get back to building my house.

247
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,359
You need to reestablish the house of God.

248
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,760
And they weren't doing that.

249
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,599
Now, let me say this,

250
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,080
and then I'll move on to the next verse

251
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,559
because there's something here I want you to see.

252
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,679
It's important to us this morning,

253
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,760
just a very simple thing.

254
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,599
There's nothing.

255
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:06,899
something profound here. But let me say this, sometimes I think we just basically get so

256
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,619
lackadaisical and so kind of, you know, we're in our comfort zone and we're kind of comfortable

257
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:17,699
and enjoying our situation, our life the way it is right now that we don't stop and think

258
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,259
about, now listen, am I moving forward for God? Am I doing what God wants me to do? Am

259
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:27,219
I busy about God's work? Or am I just basically coasting along here in my Christian life?

260
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:31,079
There's too much of that. We don't have much time left. You're going to hear me preach

261
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,679
about that a little bit this morning. Let me tell you something, friends. We need to

262
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,319
understand this. Jesus is coming soon. And the night cometh when no man can work. And

263
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:44,239
so we all of us need to be busy about God's business. Now I'm going to walk down the aisle

264
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:47,239
so I'm not forgetting these people up here. I'll come back in a minute. We need to be

265
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:52,199
busy about God's business. And we've just gotten to the point, I think, where we've

266
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,759
gotten into this spiritual lethargy and this spiritual apathy and we forgot about God.

267
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,699
By the way, we see the children of Israel on two different occasions. God said to them,

268
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:06,739
listen, you've forgotten me days without number. Well, we used to be a God-conscious nation,

269
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:12,979
America. You remember that we were at one time a God-conscious nation? Amen? Our friends

270
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:17,819
back here are from western Pennsylvania. My brother, I don't know how old you are, but

271
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:24,819
I'm a little older maybe than you, I think. Amen? Pennsylvania was a blue state law. We

272
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,859
were a blue law state. I'm sorry, I got that backwards. We were a blue law state. Everything

273
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:38,939
was closed on Sunday. Nothing was open on the Lord's Day. I remember that. I grew up

274
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:45,419
under that in the 40s and the 50s and early 60s and everything was closed. But the churches

275
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,899
were open. And the neighborhood in which I lived, I was born in West Philadelphia and

276
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,339
then we moved out to the suburbs. The neighborhood I lived in and my wife lived in, I don't know

277
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:02,339
of anybody on my block that didn't go to church. Everybody went to church. Maybe not

278
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,959
the right churches, but everybody went to church because we were a God-conscious nation.

279
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:15,799
And then when they repealed the blue laws, I think it was in the late 60s, when they

280
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,759
repealed the blue laws and we had them down here, Virginia had blue laws as well. When

281
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,479
the blue laws got repealed and all the malls opened up and all the other stuff started

282
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,899
happening and everything else was going on on Sundays and everybody was playing baseball

283
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,539
and football and basketball and hockey, everything else going on on Sundays, all of a sudden

284
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:38,539
people stopped going to church. So America was no longer a God-conscious country. So

285
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:46,179
I can hear God say, well, what about me? What about me? So He says to the children of Israel,

286
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,659
and that's a little off topic, but He says to the children of Israel, well, what about

287
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:54,159
me? He says, is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your sealed houses, and this house

288
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:01,159
lie waste? Look at verse 5, Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, say it, Consider

289
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:09,739
your ways. He said, y'all need to consider your ways. I'm in Virginia, so I'm saying

290
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,239
y'all, amen? Even though we're in northern Virginia, it's still y'all. We're below the

291
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:22,259
Mason-Dixon line here, amen? He said, y'all need to consider your ways. And He says it

292
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:29,299
not only once, but if you read through Haggai, He says it five times. So moving on to verse

293
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,499
6, He said, You have sown much, you bring in little. You eat, but you have not enough.

294
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:40,619
You drink, but you're not filled with drink. You clothe you, but there is none warm. And

295
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,959
he that earneth wages earneth wages, to put him into a bag with holes. He said, you know,

296
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,279
you guys are so busy about you and not busy about me that you're not prospering at all.

297
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,959
When you're not right with God and you're not in fellowship with God, you're not walking

298
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,499
with the Lord, you're not walking in the Spirit of God, I guarantee you, you're not going

299
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:04,959
to prosper. Now, we're not talking about the, you know, the stuff that these, you know,

300
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,759
fools on TV talk about, about this health, wealth, and prosperity stuff, and faith, seed,

301
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,139
and all that stuff. No, God said, listen, the reason you're not prospering is because

302
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,219
you're not walking in accordance with My will. You get out of the will of God, you're not

303
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:22,739
going to prosper. Let me give you a good example. If you're not tithing, and of course, most

304
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,219
of you here are probably church members, you ought to be tithing. If you're not, you're

305
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:29,939
living in sin. But He said, if you, listen, if you're not tithing, you're going to tithe

306
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,299
somewhere else. If you don't tithe the Lord, you're going to tithe to the doctor, you're

307
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,679
going to tithe to the dentist, you'll tithe to the auto mechanic. God is going to get

308
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:43,739
that tithe somewhere. When I first got saved, I can remember, I got it somehow in my mind

309
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:47,939
because I was an E6 in the Navy, that I, at that point in time, that there was no way

310
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:51,859
that I could possibly tithe. I just, we weren't making a lot of money back in those days,

311
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:56,019
and the military never made a lot of money, but we definitely weren't making a lot of

312
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,339
money then. And I said, Lord, listen, you know I can't tithe. I mean, I just can't do

313
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:09,119
it. I can't pay my bills. I'm overextended. My family won't eat if I tithe. My wife wasn't

314
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:14,339
on board with that, having been saved seven years before I was, and she was a little bit

315
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:22,919
more spiritually astute, and so I didn't tithe. All right? The first month I didn't tithe,

316
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:28,599
my car broke down. Now hear this. I mean, this is my testimony. My car broke down. The

317
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:38,419
starter went out. It was my home to work car. 1967 Datsun. What a piece of junk that was.

318
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:43,539
The starter went out. So I went down to Napa and I bought a starter. Brought it home, put

319
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:50,339
it in my car. And then I looked at the receipt, which I charged, by the way. Then I looked

320
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:58,579
at the receipt. The starter cost me, to the penny, what my tithe would have been. I said,

321
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:04,359
Lord, you've got my attention. And from that point forward, I tithe. Because I realized

322
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,239
and understood the principle that we see right here. If you rob God, and we see that in Malchai

323
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:12,639
chapter 3, if you rob God and said, listen, I'm going to tell you one thing right now,

324
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,359
you're not going to prosper. I'm going to send the locust, the palmer worm, I'm going

325
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:25,279
to send all kinds of critters into your fields to eat up your harvest. Not a good thing,

326
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:31,259
So he said, you better tithe. So he said, listen, because you've not done this, you're

327
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,899
not prospering. And you wonder why. I like what he says there. It's kind of a funny statement.

328
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,559
But he says, and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put into a bag with holes. So this

329
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,279
comes in and goes right out again. Now, verse 7, he says again, look, Thus saith the Lord

330
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:51,279
of hosts, Consider your ways. God wants us to consider our ways. When we go into a Bible

331
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,159
meeting, that's what we ought to be doing. We should be examining ourselves. We ought

332
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,839
to confront ourselves. The Word of God will confront us for sure. We ought to put ourselves

333
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,319
on trial. That's a volitional thing. It's a matter of choice. A lot of people aren't

334
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,719
going to pay any attention sometimes to the beck and call of the Holy Ghost. If I tell

335
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:11,919
you this, I was preaching down in Torrance, California, one time, a bigger auditorium

336
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,719
than this, a big crowd that morning. About halfway down here, back here, I'd ask your

337
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:21,319
dad if that ever happened to him. About halfway down here, there's a woman sitting here. She's

338
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,679
sitting right there, two kids in the middle, and her husband here. I'm preaching. I can't

339
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,079
remember this day why I was preaching. While I'm preaching, she stuck her fingers in her

340
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:36,119
ears. I said, now, that's kind of strange. So she sticks her fingers in her ears. Now

341
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,639
not only is she sticking her fingers in her ears, now she's shaking her head no at me.

342
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:48,719
I'm a young preacher, and I'm kind of irritated by this, I guess. It was bothering me. So

343
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,279
I thought, you know, I'm just going to go right back there and stand right where she's

344
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,399
sitting, and I'm going to preach right there. And the Holy Spirit, you know, that still

345
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:02,819
small voice, that whisper, said, don't you do it. I'll take care of her. So when the

346
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,319
service is over, she's at the back door. And I said to one of the deacons, I said, who

347
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,679
is that woman? And he said, oh, that's the head deacon's wife. And they're back there

348
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,759
shaking hands with people leaving the building. And I said, I'm going to go back there and

349
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,079
chat with her. I said, that woman stuck her fingers in her ears while I'm preaching. Oh,

350
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:22,719
she wouldn't do that. I said, she did it. I'm either lying or dying. And I was going

351
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:26,839
to head right back there. The Spirit of God said, don't you do it. I'll handle that. Now,

352
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,719
I've never heard anybody do that to me again. Now, it seems to me like I've read an account

353
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,679
in the Bible where it says they stopped their ears. Well, that's kind of what she did. And

354
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,359
I thought, why would somebody that claims to be saved by the grace of God do that? But

355
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,359
you know what the truth of the matter is? Something got to her from the Word of God,

356
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:49,959
she didn't want to hear it. Therefore, she was not willing to, you ready for this? It's

357
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:55,440
not a, listen, it's not profoundity here. Therefore, she was not willing to examine

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,440
her ways. Not willing to consider. Not willing to be confronted about her ways. Go back to

359
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,319
1 Corinthians, please. We'll go back there very quickly. 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Oh,

360
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:14,199
good. You've got a clock back there. Praise the Lord. I can see you, God. I have to keep

361
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:19,399
doing this. 1 Corinthians chapter 11. I want you to start in verse 17. I'll lay some foundation

362
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:22,919
here. Of course, we know this passage of Scripture. We use this when we have a Lord's Supper.

363
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,079
At least I've done it over the years. I'm sure you do it here as well. It's a classic

364
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,000
application of the Lord's Supper. But 1 Corinthians chapter 11, verse 17. I'm going to read down

365
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,199
through this very quickly.

366
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:36,079
So now, in this I declare unto you, and I praise you not, that you come together not

367
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,839
for the better, but for the worse. For first of all, when you come together in the church,

368
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,440
I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it. Boy, it's a terrible

369
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,919
thing to have divisions in the church. It's good when the brethren dwell together in unity.

370
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,799
For there must be also heresies. In other words, they were developing sex within the

371
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,239
church. There also must be heresies among you, that they which are proved may be made

372
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,440
manifest among you.

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,760
When you come together, therefore, at one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.

374
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,600
For in eating every one taketh before the other his own supper, and one is hungry and

375
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
another is drunken."

376
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Man, there's a lot of preaching right here.

377
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,880
"'Well, what, have you not houses to eat and drink in, or despise ye the church of

378
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,000
God, and shame them that have not?

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,320
What shall I say unto you?

380
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,520
Shall I praise you in this?'

381
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,840
Well, I'm going to tell you what, I praise you not.

382
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,240
"'For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus,

383
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,280
the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.

384
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,880
And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said, Take, eat.

385
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,560
This is my body, which is broken for you.

386
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,240
This do in remembrance of me,' because it's a symbol of his death, it's an emblem, it's

387
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
a memorial service.

388
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,160
"'After the same manner also he took the cup, and after he had supped and sang, This

389
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,000
cup is the new testament of my blood.

390
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,880
This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me.

391
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show, demonstrate the Lord's

392
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,880
death until he come.'"

393
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,800
Verse 27, "'Wherefore, whose service shall eat this bread and drink of this cup unworthily?'

394
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,440
By the way, none of us are worthy of the death, burial, and blood of Jesus Christ.

395
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,360
You think about his death, burial, and resurrection as we celebrate the Lord's Supper, we think

396
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,160
about the precious blood of Jesus.

397
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,080
None of us are worthy of that.

398
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,080
He said, so you drink this cup of this Lord, not to drink the cup of the Lord unworthily,

399
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,639
carelessly, or reverently, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

400
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:29,639
Now look at this.

401
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:34,200
"'But let a man examine himself,' you see that, "'and so let him eat of that bread and

402
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,760
drink of that cup.

403
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,860
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily or carelessly eateth and drinketh damnation

404
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,100
or judgment to himself, not discerning or honoring the Lord's body.

405
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,200
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, many sleep.

406
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,639
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.'"

407
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Listen, if we would judge ourselves and get things right with God, we wouldn't have to

408
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
experience chastisement.

409
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
God wouldn't have to judge our sins.

410
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
But when we are judged, we're chastened to the Lord.

411
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,639
"'For whom, Lord, lovely chasteneth, that we should not be condemned by the world.'"

412
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:05,639
Amen.

413
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,279
It just basically proves you're saved when God chastises you.

414
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,199
No chastisement, you're not saved.

415
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,559
That's kind of what he's saying.

416
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,559
But I want you to see this.

417
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,720
He said, you need to examine yourself.

418
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,900
He said, don't come to the Lord's table and do so flippantly or irreverently.

419
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Examine yourself.

420
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,699
God once again says, listen, consider your ways and examine yourself.

421
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:29,619
I can show you a whole lot of teaching in the Bible that speaks about this.

422
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,260
Examine yourself.

423
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Just listen to this.

424
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Job 13, 23.

425
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,020
"'How many are mine iniquities and sins?'

426
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Job says.

427
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,500
"'Well, make me to know my transgression and my sin.'"

428
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,820
Psalm 26, 2, "'Examine me, O Lord, and prove me.

429
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,100
Try my reins and my heart.'"

430
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,380
Psalm 4, 4, "'Stand in awe and sin not.

431
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,699
Commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still.'"

432
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:53,699
Selah.

433
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:56,500
Psalm 77, 6, "'I call to remembrance my song in the night.

434
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,220
I commune with my own heart, and my spirit may diligent search.'"

435
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,380
That's talking about intense examination.

436
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,020
Psalm 119, 59, like this one, "'I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.'"

437
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Wow.

438
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,100
Well, there's something right there.

439
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,660
That's something to think about right there.

440
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,020
He said, listen, I'll tell you what I did.

441
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,580
I thought on my ways.

442
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,260
I mean, that's intentionally stopping and thinking about my ways.

443
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,339
God said at one point somewhere along the line, I remember reading, your ways are not

444
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,740
my ways, friends.

445
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,460
Sometimes you've chosen the wrong way, not my way.

446
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,339
And His way's the right way, always the right way.

447
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:36,500
He said, listen, I stopped.

448
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,779
He said, I thought on my ways, and as a result, I turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

449
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,460
Now, that's a good thing.

450
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Lamentations 340.

451
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
I like this one, too.

452
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,860
"'Let us search and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord.'"

453
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Wow.

454
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,660
Galatians 6, 4, "'But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing

455
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,380
in himself alone, not in another.'"

456
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,300
Second Corinthians 13, 5, this is an important one, "'Examine yourselves.'"

457
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,380
"'Examine yourselves,' Paul says to the Corinthian church, "'Examine yourselves,' and he had a

458
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,460
reason for saying this, "'Examine yourselves whether you be in the faith.

459
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,459
Prove your own selves.

460
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:21,260
Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?'

461
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,260
So Paul said, listen, you need to make sure you're saved."

462
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,339
Sometimes, you know, we've got people come into revival meetings just aren't saved.

463
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,459
I was preaching at my home church last week, and I used the Ten Commandments.

464
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:37,899
I went through all of the Ten Commandments, not the ten suggestions, the ten opinions.

465
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:41,260
Galatians chapter 20, I went down through each one of the Ten Commandments, and talked

466
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,619
about them, and explained why God gave the moral law.

467
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,220
Why did God give us the Ten Commandments?

468
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,420
Well, Galatians chapter 3 gives the answer.

469
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:56,059
As a schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ, to convict us of sin, because there's no man

470
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,059
except the God-man, Christ Jesus, that was ever capable of keeping the law.

471
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,339
And in fact, the Bible says the law was fulfilled in Him.

472
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:09,059
So we know He can't keep the law, so as you read down through the Ten Commandments, somewhere

473
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,700
along the line, you ought to get convicted.

474
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,899
For an unsaved person, I use the Ten Commandments in soul winning.

475
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,940
I'm not one of these one, two, three, pray after me guys.

476
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,459
I don't like this easy decisionism.

477
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:25,619
I want people to know why they're lost, and know what the Bible says about being lost.

478
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:26,619
And then you can lead them to Christ.

479
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:30,580
You can't get somebody saved, get them lost first, amen?

480
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,580
So I want to get them lost.

481
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,580
You can get them lost in the Ten Commandments.

482
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Well, sir, have you ever told a lie?

483
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,260
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

484
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Have you ever told a lie?

485
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Well, yeah, I've done that.

486
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Well, then the Bible says you're a liar.

487
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,580
You've got to be careful with how you approach this.

488
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Amen.

489
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Amen.

490
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,140
Well, have you ever taken anything that's not yours?

491
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,619
No, yeah, when I was a kid, I stole something.

492
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,299
I shoplifted in a candy store.

493
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:57,059
I said, well, then you're a thief.

494
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,739
The Bible says you're a lying thief.

495
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,860
Have you ever coveted something that's not yours?

496
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,940
Maybe your neighbor's car.

497
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Maybe you've got a Toyota.

498
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
He's got a Lexus.

499
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
You'd like to have his Lexus.

500
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,179
Well, thou shalt not covet.

501
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,619
So you're a coveting, lying thief.

502
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:13,619
I mean, you can go on and on.

503
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:14,619
You can go right on down the list.

504
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:15,899
Now, you've got to be careful with it.

505
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,140
Once again, you have to be careful how you approach people with that.

506
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,660
But you can get them lost that way.

507
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,299
Well, Glaser's chapter 3 says, well, what is the purpose of the law?

508
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,779
Well, the purpose of the law is to be a schoolmaster to convictives of sin.

509
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:31,220
The cause of the recognized were lost, it turned to Christ to be saved.

510
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,980
So I mean, you can use the law as an effective tool.

511
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,459
So it's a matter of people examining themselves.

512
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,899
And so I wanted our church to see that.

513
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,420
I said, now, we've got some people here this morning, I'll guarantee you, we've probably

514
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,420
got some church members here that are lost.

515
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,540
Just because you're a church member, it doesn't impress me.

516
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,940
In fact, it doesn't impress God.

517
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,980
Maybe you're a tithing church member and you take the Lord's Supper and all the rest of

518
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
it.

519
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,459
And maybe you're even out knocking doors with us on Saturdays, but you've never been

520
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,459
born again.

521
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,899
Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith.

522
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:03,940
Because you've never been changed.

523
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,140
You may have changed the outside.

524
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,820
Oh, here we go now.

525
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,619
You may have changed the outside, but the heart's never been changed.

526
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:13,420
You got a three-piece suit and a King James haircut, but your heart's never been changed.

527
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,140
And because your heart's never been changed, it shows up on the outside in the way you

528
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
live your life.

529
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
And you've never been changed.

530
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,580
You live a two-standard life.

531
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,339
You'll live one way outside the church and one way in the church because it's more important

532
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,940
you have people see you than it is how God sees you.

533
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Amen.

534
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,500
Preacher, that's good.

535
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,100
I mean, it really does convict people.

536
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
So I want them to see that.

537
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,420
Well, we had two people saved at the service.

538
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,940
Now I don't know, they weren't church members that I know of.

539
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Amen.

540
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,420
I wrote this down for me.

541
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,260
The hardest thing to do is to honestly examine ourselves.

542
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,019
And the reason that we won't do it is because we sometimes engage in self-deception.

543
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:56,019
Well, I'm really okay.

544
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,339
It makes you feel easy and comfortable.

545
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,860
We can deceive ourselves sometimes when we don't examine ourselves the way we should.

546
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,459
So we ought to examine ourselves, inspect ourselves in detail, examine ourselves and

547
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:12,100
look at ourselves thoroughly in accordance with the Word of God.

548
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Amen.

549
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,019
Now I've got to move along here.

550
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,700
I don't have much time left.

551
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,500
Oswald J. Smith put this out.

552
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
I really like this.

553
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,860
He's a great Canadian pastor.

554
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,420
Some of you have probably read some of his material.

555
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,700
He has a lot of good material out there, especially about missions.

556
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,459
But he wrote a little thing about self-examination.

557
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,380
He gave a list.

558
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,700
And in the entire list, are we guilty?

559
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,179
Let me just quickly read you the list.

560
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,820
Number one, this is when it comes to self-examination.

561
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,500
Number one, have we forgiven everyone?

562
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,340
Is there any malice, spite, hatred or enmity in our hearts?

563
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Do we cherish grudges?

564
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,619
Have we refused to be reconciled?

565
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,619
We ought to be reconciled to our brother.

566
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:57,419
If you have one against another, you should make that right with him.

567
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,179
During revival times, that's one of the things that sometimes happens.

568
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,500
I've seen it happen in two churches.

569
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,859
We had a revival break out in two churches, and I had no idea, preaching that meeting,

570
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:10,900
that half the church was at odds with the other half.

571
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,619
And in one church, they were all upset with the pastor's wife.

572
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,460
And during the invitation, she's playing the piano, had to stop because people are

573
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,739
coming, weeping, asking for her forgiveness and hugging her because they had ought against

574
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:26,419
her, and asked her forgiveness.

575
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:30,580
The song leader got up and said, I preached on pride the night before.

576
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,179
We'd extended the meeting out another day.

577
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,340
And he got up and he said, listen, he said, I'm just full of pride.

578
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,059
He said, I think I raised perfect kids, had a perfect home, had a perfect marriage, and

579
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,140
I thought we had every hair in place, and the rest of the church was just really in

580
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,659
serious trouble.

581
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,619
And his wife got up and said the same thing.

582
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,380
And revival broke out in that place, and I just went back and sat in the back back there

583
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,580
and said, hallelujah, praise God, just let it go and happen, turn it over to the pastor

584
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,299
and let him just handle the thing.

585
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,340
And it went on and on and on.

586
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,500
And it all had to do with reconciliation amongst the church.

587
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,460
the brethren, saw it happen to another church. Number two, do we get angry? Come on now.

588
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:14,899
Do we get angry? Are there any uprisings within? Is it true that we still lose our tempers?

589
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:21,899
Does wrath hold us at times in its grip? Do you get angry? I get angry sometimes driving

590
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:29,180
through Los Angeles. It's not a rush hour. It's a parking lot, and I just can't handle

591
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,180
traffic, and I get angry. And my wife, I said to men yesterday, my wife says, you just stress

592
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:42,180
me out. When we were doing the RV, it was even worse. And she said, do you just have

593
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:48,020
joy? And I said, oh yeah, I'm really enjoying this, praise the Lord. Number three, is there

594
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,380
any feeling of jealousy when another's preferred before us? Does it make us envious and uncomfortable?

595
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,979
Do we get jealous of those who can pray, and speak, and do things better than we can?

596
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:07,620
Number four, do we get impatient and irritated? I had someone tell me one time, pastor, I

597
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,940
just want to let you know you irritate me. I said, wait a minute, get in line, brother.

598
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,779
What can I tell a guy that says that? I can only say, well, I'm sorry, I mean, how did

599
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,279
I irritate you? And then he's going to give me a list, you know. Do little things vex

600
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,580
and annoy, or are we sweet, calm, and unruffled under all circumstances? Number five, are

601
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,220
we offended easily? There's a big one. When people fail to notice us and pass by without

602
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:39,019
speaking, does it hurt? If others are made much of, and we are neglected, how do we feel

603
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:46,220
about it? Number six, is there any pride in our hearts? No, no, no, no, none of us ever

604
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,019
deal with that. Come on now, are we puffed up? Do we think a great deal of our own position

605
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:59,019
and attainments? Number seven, have we been dishonest? Is our business open and above

606
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,059
reproach? Do we give a yard for a yard and a pound for a pound? Are we honest in our

607
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:06,980
statements or do we exaggerate and thus convey false impressions? I submit unto you that

608
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,059
the number one most probably insidious, pervasive sin amongst Christian people is lying. We

609
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:18,339
come forth from the womb speaking lies. We're born liars. Unless the Holy Spirit of God

610
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:24,419
has control of that, we can still be involved in lying, and we have a tendency to exaggerate

611
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:31,059
when it benefits us. Number eight, have we been gossiping about people? No, we don't

612
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:38,820
do that in Baptist churches. I've got an example, I'll use it later. Do we slander the character

613
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,699
of others? Well, that seems like that's almost like a spectator sport in America today. People

614
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:48,259
just slandering each other, tearing each other apart, so much divisions and vitriol and so

615
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:53,059
much bitterness and angst. It's amazing what's happened to our society today. Everybody's

616
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,779
impugning each other's character and tearing each other apart to try to get their way and

617
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:02,619
to put forth their own agenda. It's disgusting. Do we slander the character of others? Are

618
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:08,259
we tail bearers in busybodies? Number nine, do we criticize unlovingly, harshly, severely?

619
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:13,380
Are we always finding fault and looking for flaws in others? Yeah, we do that. Number

620
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,899
10, do we rob God? Have we stolen time that belongs to Him? Has our money been withheld?

621
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:26,259
Number 11, are we guilty of the sin of unbelief? In spite of all He has done for us, do we

622
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:31,380
still refuse to believe the promises of His Word? God is good for His Word. Aren't you

623
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,940
glad for that? Number 12, have we committed the sin of prayerlessness? Are we intercessors?

624
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,820
Do we pray? How much time are we spending on our knees? Have we crowded prayer out of

625
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,460
our lives? Number 13, are we neglecting God's Word? How many chapters do we read each day?

626
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,300
Are we Bible students? Do we draw our source of supply from the Scriptures? Number 14,

627
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,119
are we burdened for the salvation of souls? Have we a love for the lost? Is there any

628
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,339
compassion in our hearts for those who are perishing? Number 15, have we failed to confess

629
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,699
Christ openly? Are we ashamed of Jesus? Do we keep our mouths closed when we're surrendered

630
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:11,539
by worldly people we're witnessing daily? Number 16, are our lives filled with lightness

631
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:16,859
and frivolity? Is our conduct unseemly? Would the world, by our actions, consider us on

632
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:23,200
its side? Well, that's a good one there. Number 17, have we wronged anyone and failed to make

633
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,179
restitution or has the spirit of Zacchaeus possessed us? Have we restored the many little

634
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,739
things that God has shown us? Number 18, are we worried or anxious? Do we fail to trust

635
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,540
God for our temporal and spiritual needs? Are we constantly crossing bridges before

636
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,179
we come to them? Number 19, are we guilty of lustful thoughts? Do we allow our minds

637
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,940
to harbor impure and unholy imaginations? That's a big problem today with men because

638
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,920
I'll tell you what, you can't hardly go out in the public anymore and not be offended

639
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:59,059
by what we see or be enticed by it. It's sad. A. W. Tozer wrote this in his classic work

640
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:03,380
The Pursuit of God. He said this, he said, the man who has struggled to purify himself

641
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,260
and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops

642
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,500
tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one. While he looks at Christ,

643
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,779
the very thing he has so long been trying to do, we'll be getting done with him. We

644
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:22,660
should examine ourselves in light of the truth being revealed to us from Scripture and allow

645
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,200
God's Word to convict us and change us. At the same time, we must humbly admit our inability

646
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,679
to change ourselves and rely on the power of ourselves and rely on the power of the

647
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:43,000
Holy Spirit within to transform us into the image of Christ. So, when you consider all

648
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,839
these things, this idea of self-examination, self-confrontation, to me personally is a

649
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:57,200
very important thing when it comes to revival, to revival. When God's willing to send revival,

650
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,359
the problem's not with him. The problem's not with God, the problem's with us. And

651
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,239
you say, well, that sounds like kind of a blanking indictment. Well, in some ways it

652
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,600
is. I mean, we really have to look at us, not only just individually, but corporately

653
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,760
as well. You know? One of the things that I've seen in revival is this. We talked about

654
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,959
this, we're talking about this a couple of times since we've been here. One of the

655
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,200
things I've seen in revival about this is that when revival comes, man, the old-fashioned

656
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,320
excitement that one time permeated our churches. I mean, just the joy, the zeal. Once again,

657
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,399
I'll bring it up a little bit, the sporting in the morning message. Let me tell you what,

658
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,959
the joy and the zeal that really ought to be in the house of God and the excitement

659
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:39,200
ought to be there, the enthusiasm ought to be there. When revival comes, God restores

660
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,799
that. You know? Some people come to church, look like they've been sucking lemon juice

661
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:52,640
through PVC pipe all week long, man, they just come to work sour. You know? God doesn't

662
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,239
want us to come to the house of the Lord that way. We ought to have joy, joy unspeakable

663
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,480
full glory. We ought to be excited about something. You know, the world's excited about all kinds

664
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:10,679
of things. Amen? I have a picture on my phone, Lord forgive me, I have a picture on my phone

665
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:20,760
of a 2024 Corvette Z06. No, I love Corvettes. Amen? I'm 77 years old, I have no business

666
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,480
even thinking about that. But if God give me one of them, I sure drive it, amen? I

667
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,079
sure would. And let me tell you this, I mean, I was in a car dealer the other day getting

668
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:35,799
my car serviced and there's one out in the showroom floor, it's one of the only ones

669
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:41,279
on the West Coast. It's a Copa, it's a beautiful car. And I'm looking at this thing, man, I'm

670
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:44,040
looking at it and I'm saying, wow, this is some car, let's take a picture of it. Guy

671
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,559
said, hey, can I sell this to you? I said, you could, but I said I couldn't afford it,

672
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:56,519
it was $172,000. And I said, yeah, I said, it's looking good, man. I said, that thing

673
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:02,079
looks fast just sitting there. And he said, do you think you can handle this car? I said,

674
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,440
try me out. He said, I'll road test it right now. Well, see, now that excites me. I just,

675
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,880
I'm a car guy, I'm an aviation guy for one thing, but I'm a car guy and I like cars and

676
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,760
the faster the better. And sometimes the Lord has to convict me of that.

677
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,359
Now preacher, you don't need to be thinking about that stuff. Now the car excites me,

678
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,119
just looking at it excited me. The thought of having one really excites me. But here's

679
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,280
the thing, if something like that, some kind of a material thing like that can excite us,

680
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,280
then what about the things of God? Why don't we get excited about the things of God? You

681
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:48,840
know? So we ought to get excited. We ought to be enthusiastic. We ought to rejoice about

682
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,640
the things of the Lord. God's been good to us. For God is good and his mercy endureth

683
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,559
forever. God's been so good. I praise the Lord for it. We need to examine ourselves

684
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,919
and sometimes engage in self-confrontation. Father, we thank you Lord this morning for

685
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:06,200
what we've seen in that word, just a very simple Sunday school lesson, but yet still

686
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,960
at the same time, I think very important. So God, as we begin this revival meeting this

687
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,880
week, I pray that we would be willing to spend some time as did David. We see in the

688
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,000
Psalms that he many times would, even in the early hours of the morning, in the middle

689
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,960
of the night at times, he would lay in his bed and he would muse and he would consider

690
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,000
and he'd think about and examine himself. Lord, sometimes we just need to stop and do

691
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,679
that as well. I pray God that we would this week just seek your face and Lord, we just

692
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,239
bow before you God, cry out your name and ask that you would once again breathe fresh

693
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,080
upon us. Oh Spirit of God, do that which only you can do. Work in our hearts and lives.

694
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,679
Begin with me, oh God, I pray. I'm a needy preacher. I need your help and I need you

695
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,880
to speak to me this week as well. So Lord, I pray that we would just have a meeting this

696
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,400
week which would be honoring and glorifying to you. We'll thank you for it in advance

697
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
in Jesus' name. Amen. Pastor?

698
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,960
Amen. You are dismissed.
