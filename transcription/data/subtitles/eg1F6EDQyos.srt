1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
portion of the verse, and we understand that we've been dealing with the subject matter

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,760
of deception here on Wednesday evenings for a number of weeks now, and almost two full

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,040
months on Wednesday evenings now that we've been looking at this subject matter.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,559
And we, of course, have issued a warning with regard to the deception in which is so prevalent

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,719
in the society in which we live.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,440
We understand that as we look to the Word of God that God has given us warning with

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,000
regard to deception, and I believe that as we would really honestly evaluate the society

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,580
in which we live, that it would not be too challenging for us to acknowledge that we

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,360
are living in an age of deception.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,799
And we understand that Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God there, and he's

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:55,080
writing and he's giving truth in 2 Timothy 3 with regard to the end times and perilous

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,560
times, and he gives some details and descriptions.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,680
One of the things that is mentioned is that evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,620
deceiving and being deceived.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,040
And we see it all around us.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,040
And we issued a number of warnings, looked at a number of passages dealing with the danger

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,639
of deception, the fact that there are many deceivers that have gone out, that there are

18
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:22,040
many that lie in wait to deceive.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,239
But in the last couple of weeks, and including this evening, we've looked more at the subject

20
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,639
of deception, not strictly from the perspective of being deceived by someone else, but the

21
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,680
danger of being deceived ourselves.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,199
And it is an awful thing to be deceived from without, but you think about the subject matter,

23
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,800
and as we've looked at a few of these truths, and again this evening, we'll find that it's

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,080
not so much of deception from without, it's deception from within.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,680
And as we look at this portion of Scripture, notice in verse number 22 of James 1, the

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Bible says,

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,540
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only.

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,279
And then notice this phrase, deceiving your own selves.

29
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:20,880
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,800
For if any man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is likened to a man beholding

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
his natural face in a glass.

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,220
How many of you looked in the mirror before you left house this evening?

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,279
And some of you didn't, we know, I'm just teasing.

34
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:43,960
But the reality is that you look in a mirror and you get that picture, and there are times

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,639
when you look in the mirror and you say, oh, I need help, right?

36
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,960
Like, man, this is a mess, and there's something I need to do here.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,320
And that mirror gives us that view, that picture.

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,639
And here, notice he says that the one that is a hearer of the word, but not a doer, he's

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,880
like a man that is beholding his natural face in a glass.

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,360
And then notice verse number 24,

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,919
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of

42
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,520
man he was.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,059
And what a tragic situation.

44
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:26,360
We find that, of course, we're looking at this tonight from a spiritual perspective.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,240
The natural illustration is provided to us in these verses of Scripture.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,080
But I want you to notice in verse 25, it says,

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,520
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
What is that?

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,839
It's the Bible, the word of God, amen?

50
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,160
The perfect law of liberty.

51
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,479
And then notice these three words,

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:56,679
And continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall

53
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:00,479
be blessed in his deed.

54
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,960
I want to be blessed.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Amen?

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,800
I want the blessing of God.

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,119
You think about Joshua 1, and you think about all the truth that God is giving Joshua as

58
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:16,720
he's preparing to enter into the land of promise and take the people into that land.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
And we find that he, God, says to Joshua, in fact, he gives him many promises in the

60
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,920
first chapter, but in verse number 8, he says,

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,200
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein

62
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
day and night.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,920
And here's why, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein.

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Then he tells him this, for then, not before then, not if you exclude this, but as you

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,760
are in the word of God, meditating and obeying the word of God, observing the word of God,

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,760
for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,760
We find here that he is telling us in both that passage of Scripture, and again here

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,760
in James 1, that as we look into the perfect law of liberty, into the word of God, and

69
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,119
we continue therein, we're not being a forgetful hearer, but we're a doer of the work.

70
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,440
This man shall be blessed in his deed.

71
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,720
So this evening, as we look at this warning in James 1 and verse number 22, I've simply

72
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,480
entitled the message this evening from the last part of that verse, deceiving your own

73
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,440
selves.

74
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,160
Now it's terrible for someone to deceive you, right?

75
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,559
How many of you have ever been deceived in your life?

76
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:44,480
I think all of us can acknowledge there's been a time that someone has deceived me.

77
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,720
In fact, there probably have been more times than we'd like to remember that someone has

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,880
deceived us.

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:59,279
But what a tragedy that we would deceive our own selves.

80
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,600
That's a tragedy.

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:10,000
And we find here, the cause of this self-deception is in hearing the word of God, but not doing

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
the word of God.

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:20,480
Hearing the word of God, but not doing, not applying, not taking heed, not understanding

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,239
that this is the message not for my brother or my sister, not for I wish somebody else

85
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:32,559
were here to hear this, or not that man, I'm glad you came because you needed this,

86
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:38,399
but God is speaking to me.

87
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,440
We find that no doubt this is a danger that each one of God's people face.

88
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,519
It's a danger that we are hearers of the word, but not doers of the word.

89
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:59,160
That we don't actually take the time to determine how is it that the truth that God has given

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,399
us, how is it that the perfect law of liberty that He has preserved for us, that we have

91
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,480
for us this evening, how is it that it's supposed to impact my life?

92
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,480
How am I a doer of the word?

93
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,320
I want you to take your Bibles and go to Matthew chapter number 7 if you will.

94
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,799
In Matthew chapter number 7, we're nearing the end of the Sermon on the Mount, and of

95
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:28,600
course there's much that you could look at in these chapters here in the book of Matthew,

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,559
and we're nearing the very end of the Sermon on the Mount.

97
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:36,920
In fact, I mentioned as we were studying on Sunday morning in our Sunday school hour from

98
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,119
Matthew 8, verses 1 through 4, and how that you understand that there were great multitudes

99
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:48,320
that followed the Lord Jesus Christ after that teaching on the Sermon on the Mount.

100
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,239
And one of the reasons that so many followed is because He taught them as one having authority

101
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,559
and not as the scribes.

102
00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:02,320
But I want you to notice how that Jesus as He ends the Sermon on the Mount and the content

103
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:09,480
of all that is contained here in these chapters, and you find that really the preaching begins

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,119
in chapter number 5, and all the way through chapter 5, all the way through chapter 6,

105
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:19,160
and all the way through chapter 7, and there's so much truth that is given.

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,320
And we find that as the conclusion is coming to the Sermon on the Mount, that Jesus says

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,760
this in verse number 24,

108
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:34,599
Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him

109
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,000
unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,479
The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house,

111
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,479
and it fell not.

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,840
For it was founded upon a rock.

113
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,440
And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened

114
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,599
unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand.

115
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:06,320
The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house,

116
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,280
and it fell.

117
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,479
And great was the fall of it.

118
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:15,760
We're familiar with this passage of Scripture at the end of Matthew 7.

119
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,640
In fact, we sing a song with the kids about this particular passage of Scripture.

120
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,359
The wise man built his house upon the rock, right?

121
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:29,359
We sing the song with the children, and we understand the teaching that is given here,

122
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:34,559
but with regard to, and you see the similarities between even the verbiage that is used by

123
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,640
the Lord Jesus Christ here in these few verses of Scripture with that as we've looked at

124
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,760
in James 1 and verse 22.

125
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,440
And I want you to notice simply this evening, the message delivered.

126
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
The message delivered.

127
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,880
We find that in verse number 24, and again in verse number 26, that the same words are

128
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,239
used, the same idea.

129
00:09:55,239 --> 00:10:00,039
Notice what he says, whosoever hereth, notice, these sayings of mine.

130
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,039
of mine."

131
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,999
He says that in v. 24, and then if you skip down to v. 26, he says,

132
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,719
"...everyone that heareth these sayings of mine."

133
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:13,039
We understand that the message here that is being spoken of is the Sermon on the Mount.

134
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,919
It's the message, these sayings of mine, it is the message that was delivered by Jesus

135
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,639
Christ Himself.

136
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,679
Now He's God.

137
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,559
He's perfect.

138
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,799
Amen?

139
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:34,239
There are absolute certain times in which you can take note of the deficiencies of the

140
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:40,539
human delivery individual, the deliverer of the message, the preacher, the pastor.

141
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:48,179
There are times that we, in our failures, we fail to communicate the Word of God appropriately.

142
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,179
No doubt.

143
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,359
We're fallible people.

144
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:57,159
But Jesus Christ, He's God.

145
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,639
No one ever taught like Him.

146
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,519
In fact, the passage ends in v. 29 that He taught as one having authority, not as the

147
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,359
scribes.

148
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:16,879
And when you read the words in v. 24 and v. 26, "...these sayings of mine," we understand

149
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,999
that the message was delivered, and it was delivered by Jesus Christ.

150
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,679
And I'm thankful that the message was delivered.

151
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,319
I'm thankful that it's not only been delivered to those that were gathered together that

152
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:34,079
heard Him on that day, but I'm thankful that it's been preserved for us, that we can go

153
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,519
and we can read the content of these sayings of mine that Jesus is referencing here in

154
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,719
this concluding statement of this wonderful message.

155
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,519
We find that the message was delivered.

156
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,139
I'd say this, number two, the message was received.

157
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,059
It was heard.

158
00:11:53,059 --> 00:12:00,179
I want you to notice that in v. 24, again, it says, "...whosoever heareth these sayings

159
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,059
of mine."

160
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:07,939
If you look in v. 26, it does not use the word whosoever, it uses the phrase everyone,

161
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,539
but notice it says, "...that heareth."

162
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:18,619
The problem was not with the receiving of the message, correct?

163
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:25,379
No doubt, the problem was not with the delivery of the message.

164
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,539
That was spot on, that's perfect, that's delivered by God Himself.

165
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:34,859
But we think about the receiving of the message, and we find here that this message was received,

166
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:41,059
that Jesus says, "...whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and everyone that heareth

167
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,339
these sayings of mine."

168
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,599
In James 1, in v. 22, where we started this evening, that we're to be doers of the Word

169
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:52,919
noticed and not hearers only.

170
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,399
You know how many people hear truth and never act upon it?

171
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,119
It's sad.

172
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,119
It's sad.

173
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:07,959
I had a man many years ago, it was probably 15 years ago now, I was not living in Virginia,

174
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,159
I didn't even know where Oakton was, so you probably don't know the individual.

175
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:20,919
And I remember his wife faithfully attended our church, and he would not come to our church.

176
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,919
And I remember I'd visit with him occasionally, and I remember on one particular evening,

177
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,639
I went to visit with this individual, and we had a nice conversation, and a nice man.

178
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,959
And I just asked him plainly, we had spoken several times, and I just plainly said to

179
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,039
him, sir, why don't you come to church?

180
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,359
And here's what his response was, I don't want to be responsible for what I hear.

181
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,959
That's what he said to me.

182
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,759
I don't want to be responsible for what I hear.

183
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,559
I was, so 15 years ago, I was 26, it might have been a little bit longer than that, I

184
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,199
might have been a little younger, so I was like, what?

185
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,479
I never heard something like this before, right?

186
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:11,599
And I sat there a little bit stunned at the man's response.

187
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:15,919
And I sat there for a moment, and it seems like maybe 5 or 10 seconds of silence, and

188
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,959
you know 5 or 10 seconds of silence in that moment can feel like an eternity.

189
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,519
And we just kind of sat there, and I said, sir, with all due respect, I believe that

190
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:33,719
you're accountable for the truth, whether you come and hear it or not.

191
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:41,479
And as we continued to have that conversation, the arguments were given and everything boiled

192
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,159
down, and here's what it boiled down to.

193
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,559
He was not going to be a doer of the Word.

194
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,999
And so therefore, why am I going to hear it?

195
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,919
Because I just don't want to be responsible for it.

196
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,799
That's tragic.

197
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,199
That is sad.

198
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:03,679
It's a sad thing when the people of God hear the preaching and the teaching of the Word

199
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,679
of God, and they fail to apply it.

200
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,759
The message is delivered, the message is received.

201
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,079
I would say this, as I mentioned a moment ago, that the delivery of this message here

202
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,399
in Matthew 7, 5, 6, and 7 is a perfect delivery because it's delivered by Jesus Christ.

203
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,679
No doubt there are flaws in God's messengers today, but if God's messengers use God's Word,

204
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,479
then I would submit to you this evening that though there may be a flaw in the delivery,

205
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:38,439
there's no flaw in the message.

206
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:43,359
That's why it's my responsibility and it's the responsibility of those that would answer

207
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,159
the call that we are to preach the Word.

208
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,159
That's our job.

209
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,519
That's our duty.

210
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,219
And there's not a problem with God's Word.

211
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,759
You may find fault with the delivery.

212
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,399
You may say, well, it could have been said like this, or maybe you should have this,

213
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,399
or maybe that.

214
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
And you can take fault.

215
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:10,199
But if you sit and you simply try to criticize the preacher, you miss the message.

216
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:16,199
And here we find that Jesus says, the message has been delivered.

217
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,959
These sayings of mine, they were delivered.

218
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,359
The message had been received.

219
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,359
It was received.

220
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,359
It was heard.

221
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:27,919
It says, whosoever heareth these sayings, and everyone that heareth these sayings.

222
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:34,199
The question, however, is whether or not the message would be applied.

223
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,199
Will it be applied?

224
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,599
The reality is that here, the difference in verse 24 and 25 versus verse 26 and verse

225
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:49,839
27, the difference is in just a simple word.

226
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,819
You find in verse number 24, it says, and doeth them.

227
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:02,539
But in verse number 26, you read, and doeth them not.

228
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:05,339
One word makes all the difference.

229
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,699
And I would submit to you that the word in verse number 24 and the word in verse number

230
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:16,779
26 is what impacts the word in verse number 25 and the word in verse number 27.

231
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:22,699
In verse number 25, you find a word that you do not find in verse number 27.

232
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:29,899
In verse number 25, you read this, it fell not.

233
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:31,339
In verse 25.

234
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,819
In verse 27, you read, it fell.

235
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:40,939
So in verse number 24, it says, and doeth them.

236
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:48,219
The response of doeth them, of being a doer, of applying the truth that had been delivered,

237
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:55,139
these sayings of mine, that one, the Bible says that the result of that is that it fell

238
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,139
not.

239
00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:03,899
And God says, I'm going to liken him to a wise man, a wise man.

240
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:11,499
But the one in verse number 26 where the Bible says, and doeth them not, it says that that

241
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,819
house it fell.

242
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,559
It fell.

243
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,719
He is likened to a foolish man.

244
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:24,239
I want you to understand that as you read verse 25 and verse number 27, that in both

245
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:33,959
cases the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house.

246
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:41,320
You understand that every individual, every person is going to deal with storms in life.

247
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,719
And trials and difficulties and adversities.

248
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:49,799
And Paul says that there's a door that's been opened, but there are many adversaries.

249
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,599
We deal with problems and troubles in life.

250
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:59,359
But we find that here, as the rain descended, as the floods came, and as the winds blew

251
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,959
and beat upon the house, both individuals, both groups of people, if we could broaden

252
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,959
it this evening, they both dealt with the same thing.

253
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,639
Now they both heard the same message.

254
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:15,320
They both encountered the same storm.

255
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,599
But there's a great difference in the consequence and the result of what you read with regard

256
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,359
to whether the house stood or not.

257
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,320
And it has everything to do with whether the message is applied.

258
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,880
That we're to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,679
I would submit to you this evening that this is not just a truth that we would seek to

260
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,239
look at within the context of hearing a message delivered in a church service.

261
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:48,359
Though it's applicable in that account as the Word of God is preached and proclaimed

262
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,320
that there ought to be a response to the Word of God.

263
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,199
That there ought to be a desire on the part of the people of God to not just hear the

264
00:19:55,199 --> 00:20:00,079
message but to do the message, to apply the message, to be a doer of the Word.

265
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:07,439
to not be a forgetful hearer, as he says in James 1.

266
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,959
Why are we not a forgetful hearer?

267
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,279
Because we continue therein.

268
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,439
We're doing the Word of God.

269
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:18,039
We're applying it in our lives, and yes, that is applicable and appropriate for a response

270
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:24,199
to a church service, to a preaching, a teaching encounter that we have when the Word of God

271
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,199
is open.

272
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:28,979
But I would submit to you that this is something that we must take heed to on a daily basis

273
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:33,619
as we open the Bible in our own daily walk with Christ.

274
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:38,099
That as we open the Word of God, as we begin to read the Word of God, that we would read

275
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,779
it not so that we could simply check a box, not so that we could simply say, I had my

276
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,779
devotions, but so that we could find out what is it from this passage, what is it from these

277
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,579
chapters that God is speaking to me about?

278
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,299
What is it that I need to apply in my life?

279
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:03,379
Because I don't just want to be a hearer of the Word, I want to be a doer of the Word.

280
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:09,699
We find that as we would look at the account that is given to us in James 1, if you'd turn

281
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:14,939
back to that passage of Scripture, you find that, again, this is a verse of Scripture

282
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,539
that is often rehearsed.

283
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,179
It's a verse that oftentimes we simply say that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers

284
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,179
only.

285
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:29,139
And far too often, myself included, I will leave out those last words of the verse, deceiving

286
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,139
your own selves.

287
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:39,179
I had a man many years ago say to me at the end of a message, Preacher, that was a great

288
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,179
sermon.

289
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,819
I'm glad my wife was here.

290
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:47,419
I just avoided it like the plague, amen, because I don't want to go down that avenue as to

291
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,379
what it was that he was so thankful for.

292
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:57,499
But the reality is that, again, it's not that I come to church and hope that the Preacher

293
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:02,299
preaches a message that's really going to take care of the problem in my spouse or in

294
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:03,299
my child.

295
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,459
I come to church saying, God, how are you going to speak to me?

296
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,939
How are you going to work in my heart?

297
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:12,539
What are you going to show me from your Word that I need to do?

298
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,339
How do I respond to what God's Word says?

299
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:21,499
Listen, I don't want to be the man, as we find in verse 23 and 24, that goes and looks

300
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:28,819
into the glass and he beholds his natural face, but then he walks away and straightway

301
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:33,759
immediately forgetteth what manner of man he is.

302
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,459
Why is it that we take time at the end of our Sunday services, both morning and evening,

303
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:47,659
to have a time of invitation to give you an opportunity to respond?

304
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,499
Sometimes we shy away from going to the old-fashioned altar.

305
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,019
Somebody might think negatively of us.

306
00:22:54,019 --> 00:23:00,139
We're all sinners saved by grace, amen?

307
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:07,199
And oh, that we just say, God, how did you speak to me this morning, this evening, when

308
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:13,279
we go to church, that we have that attitude, that anticipation of, Lord, I'm asking that

309
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,239
you'd speak to me and show me and reveal to me and help me with your grace and with your

310
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:25,119
power to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only.

311
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,439
I believe that as we respond to truth that is given, as we are doers of the Word, that

312
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:34,839
God continues to reveal truth to us in His Word.

313
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,439
He continues to teach us.

314
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,439
Why?

315
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,399
Because we're responding to the truth that He's already revealed to us.

316
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,319
And as we respond to that truth and as we apply that truth and as we're doers of the

317
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,399
Word, not only will we be blessed according to verse number 25, but we find that God will

318
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:57,479
continue to work in our heart, continue to give us the instruction that we need.

319
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:06,239
I hope this evening that each of us recognize that we're not perfect, amen?

320
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,079
That God is still working on us.

321
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:15,939
There is a process that we refer to, the theological term of the progressive sanctification.

322
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:22,879
I'm thankful that positionally I'm sanctified, but the reality is from a practical standpoint,

323
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:28,139
I am daily being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.

324
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:32,799
And there's not one of us that's perfect, and every one of us need the Word of God and

325
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,799
need to apply the Word of God.

326
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,079
And as we take, listen, the message is delivered, the message is received, it's heard, but is

327
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,199
the message applied?

328
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:49,839
Are we taking the time personally in our devotions as we go to the Word of God and say, okay,

329
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,719
God, what are you teaching me from this passage?

330
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:56,499
What are you trying to draw my attention to?

331
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,519
What is it that I need to stop doing?

332
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,679
What is it that I need to start doing?

333
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,999
How is it that I can take the truth of your Word and be a doer of the Word and not a hearer

334
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:09,439
only?

335
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:13,719
This book, as I've said many times over the years, is not a book of theory.

336
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:18,199
It's a book of practice.

337
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:23,959
It's not just a theory book that, you know, these are all these theories that have been

338
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:26,759
put into a volume that we call the Bible.

339
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,079
No, it's a book of practice.

340
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,519
It's a book of applying.

341
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,759
And as we are students of the Word and as we are digging into the Word, then we're finding

342
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:43,279
how do we take and apply these truths in our lives, not deceiving our own selves.

343
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,999
Last week on Wednesday evening, we looked at that passage of Scripture in Mark chapter

344
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:53,239
number 12, where those Sadducees, the title last week was, ye therefore do greatly err.

345
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,599
And remember those Sadducees, they did not believe in the resurrection, but yet they

346
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,159
come to Jesus and they think they have Him cornered right where they want Him.

347
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,119
And they say, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be?

348
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,919
Because all of these brothers had her and there were no seed raised up, and so whose

349
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,119
wife will she be?

350
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,639
And Jesus said, ye err, not knowing the Scriptures.

351
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,639
See, as we know the Scriptures, what does it mean to know them?

352
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:26,099
It's not just a mental aptitude that's being spoken of, it's that application of the truth.

353
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,339
Jesus says, ye did not know the truth, ye greatly err, and then He says to them in

354
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:35,939
Mark 12, as He's speaking to them and responding to them, He says, He's not the God of the

355
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:39,059
dead, but of the living.

356
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:43,679
So as they would take the truth that had been revealed to them and they would be doers and

357
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,739
apply the principles, they would understand that there is a resurrection, but yet they

358
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:49,739
deny the resurrection.

359
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:54,699
That's what Jesus was getting at with those disciples, or excuse me, those Sadducees.

360
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:59,579
We find here this evening that as we look at this passage of Scripture, no doubt each

361
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,579
one of us can look back on our walk with God and our Christian life and we can say, I have

362
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,959
heard a lot of truth.

363
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:14,459
We are not in a place where truth is unavailable.

364
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:18,219
Aren't you thankful for that, by the way?

365
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:22,579
There may come a time where they try to silence our voices.

366
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:27,939
There's certain countries around the world in which they seek to do that.

367
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:33,859
I was speaking with someone yesterday and they were asking some questions about the

368
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,099
potential of some of that type of thing being done and I said, well, at that point you can

369
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:42,179
forget about live stream.

370
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,979
That'll go out the window, right?

371
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:51,619
I'm not going to let you broadcast truth if they're trying to silence you.

372
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,699
There are countries around the world that we have missionaries in where truth is not

373
00:27:55,699 --> 00:28:00,499
available like it is here, that you can't stand up with the level of freedom that we

374
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:03,979
have and proclaim truth.

375
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:08,019
But it's not about just being a hearer of truth.

376
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,979
We're to be doers of the Word, not hearers only.

377
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:18,259
Notice, deceiving your own selves.

378
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,099
I don't want someone else to deceive me.

379
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:26,979
I certainly don't want to deceive myself, right?

380
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:28,859
I don't want someone to deceive me.

381
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:32,099
I don't like being deceived.

382
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:38,699
But how tragic, how tragic if we deceive our own selves.

383
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:44,339
I've often said that the worst deception is self-deception.

384
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:49,619
You know, many times when we deceive ourselves, we don't even know it.

385
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,259
We're just completely blinded to it.

386
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:59,859
Oh, that God would help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only deceiving our

387
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:00,859
own selves.

388
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:04,099
God, I want you to speak to me and I want you to make it plain.

389
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,339
Show me how to apply the truth that you've given me.

390
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,939
Help me to make a commitment to be a doer of the Word that when your spirit, we sing

391
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:16,099
the song, I'll say, yes, Lord, yes.

392
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,179
To your will and to your way, I'll say, yes, Lord, yes.

393
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:24,619
When your spirit speaks to me, with my whole heart, I'll agree.

394
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:30,859
And my answer will be, yes, Lord, yes.

395
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:34,379
I'm going to be a doer of the Word, not a hearer only.

396
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:36,139
I don't want to deceive myself.

397
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:37,139
Let's pray.

398
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,779
Father, we love you this evening and we thank you for loving us.

399
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,379
We thank you for giving us truth.

400
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,299
We thank you for the Sermon on the Mount.

401
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:51,139
As we read those wonderful passages of Scripture in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, we're mindful as we

402
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:57,699
come to the end of that passage as we study this evening, the message was delivered, the

403
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:58,979
message was received.

404
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:05,019
But the critical aspect of that passage of Scripture is whether or not the message would

405
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,899
be applied.

406
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:13,739
There were some that heard, and they doeth them.

407
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:18,399
They respond by being a doer of the Word.

408
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:26,319
Their house fell not, stood, it withstood the storms, the trials, were likened unto

409
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,999
a wise man.

410
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:36,839
There's another group of people that in like manner heard the message, but doeth them not.

411
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,199
The house fell.

412
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,719
Foolish.

413
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:44,199
God thank you for truth.

414
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,679
Help us to be doers of the Word.

415
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,959
Thank you for the privilege of prayer.

416
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:53,599
Thank you that you hear and answer prayer.

417
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,239
Thank you that you're able to do exceeding, abundantly above all that we ask or think.

418
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:06,079
I pray this evening that as we engage in corporate prayer that you would bless, encourage us,

419
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,559
and strengthen us, and we'll thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name

420
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,559
we pray.

421
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,559
Amen.

422
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,479
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

423
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:15,919
You don't have one?
