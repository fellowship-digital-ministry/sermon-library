WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
portion of the verse, and we understand that we've been dealing with the subject matter

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.760
of deception here on Wednesday evenings for a number of weeks now, and almost two full

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.040
months on Wednesday evenings now that we've been looking at this subject matter.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.559
And we, of course, have issued a warning with regard to the deception in which is so prevalent

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.719
in the society in which we live.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.440
We understand that as we look to the Word of God that God has given us warning with

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.000
regard to deception, and I believe that as we would really honestly evaluate the society

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.580
in which we live, that it would not be too challenging for us to acknowledge that we

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.360
are living in an age of deception.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.799
And we understand that Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God there, and he's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:55.080
writing and he's giving truth in 2 Timothy 3 with regard to the end times and perilous

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.560
times, and he gives some details and descriptions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
One of the things that is mentioned is that evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.620
deceiving and being deceived.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.040
And we see it all around us.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.040
And we issued a number of warnings, looked at a number of passages dealing with the danger

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.639
of deception, the fact that there are many deceivers that have gone out, that there are

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.040
many that lie in wait to deceive.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.239
But in the last couple of weeks, and including this evening, we've looked more at the subject

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:34.639
of deception, not strictly from the perspective of being deceived by someone else, but the

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:38.680
danger of being deceived ourselves.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.199
And it is an awful thing to be deceived from without, but you think about the subject matter,

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:49.800
and as we've looked at a few of these truths, and again this evening, we'll find that it's

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.080
not so much of deception from without, it's deception from within.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.680
And as we look at this portion of Scripture, notice in verse number 22 of James 1, the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Bible says,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.540
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.279
And then notice this phrase, deceiving your own selves.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:20.880
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.800
For if any man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is likened to a man beholding

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.360
his natural face in a glass.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.220
How many of you looked in the mirror before you left house this evening?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.279
And some of you didn't, we know, I'm just teasing.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:43.960
But the reality is that you look in a mirror and you get that picture, and there are times

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.639
when you look in the mirror and you say, oh, I need help, right?

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.960
Like, man, this is a mess, and there's something I need to do here.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.320
And that mirror gives us that view, that picture.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.639
And here, notice he says that the one that is a hearer of the word, but not a doer, he's

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.880
like a man that is beholding his natural face in a glass.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.360
And then notice verse number 24,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.919
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.520
man he was.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.059
And what a tragic situation.

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:26.360
We find that, of course, we're looking at this tonight from a spiritual perspective.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.240
The natural illustration is provided to us in these verses of Scripture.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.080
But I want you to notice in verse 25, it says,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.520
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520
What is that?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.839
It's the Bible, the word of God, amen?

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.160
The perfect law of liberty.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.479
And then notice these three words,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:56.679
And continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.479
be blessed in his deed.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.960
I want to be blessed.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Amen?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.800
I want the blessing of God.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.119
You think about Joshua 1, and you think about all the truth that God is giving Joshua as

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:16.720
he's preparing to enter into the land of promise and take the people into that land.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.519
And we find that he, God, says to Joshua, in fact, he gives him many promises in the

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.920
first chapter, but in verse number 8, he says,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.200
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.000
day and night.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.920
And here's why, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.000
Then he tells him this, for then, not before then, not if you exclude this, but as you

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.760
are in the word of God, meditating and obeying the word of God, observing the word of God,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.760
for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.760
We find here that he is telling us in both that passage of Scripture, and again here

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.760
in James 1, that as we look into the perfect law of liberty, into the word of God, and

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.119
we continue therein, we're not being a forgetful hearer, but we're a doer of the work.

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.440
This man shall be blessed in his deed.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.720
So this evening, as we look at this warning in James 1 and verse number 22, I've simply

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.480
entitled the message this evening from the last part of that verse, deceiving your own

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.440
selves.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.160
Now it's terrible for someone to deceive you, right?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.559
How many of you have ever been deceived in your life?

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:44.480
I think all of us can acknowledge there's been a time that someone has deceived me.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.720
In fact, there probably have been more times than we'd like to remember that someone has

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.880
deceived us.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.279
But what a tragedy that we would deceive our own selves.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.600
That's a tragedy.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:10.000
And we find here, the cause of this self-deception is in hearing the word of God, but not doing

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.600
the word of God.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.480
Hearing the word of God, but not doing, not applying, not taking heed, not understanding

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.239
that this is the message not for my brother or my sister, not for I wish somebody else

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:32.559
were here to hear this, or not that man, I'm glad you came because you needed this,

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:38.399
but God is speaking to me.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:45.440
We find that no doubt this is a danger that each one of God's people face.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.519
It's a danger that we are hearers of the word, but not doers of the word.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:59.160
That we don't actually take the time to determine how is it that the truth that God has given

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.399
us, how is it that the perfect law of liberty that He has preserved for us, that we have

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:11.480
for us this evening, how is it that it's supposed to impact my life?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.480
How am I a doer of the word?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.320
I want you to take your Bibles and go to Matthew chapter number 7 if you will.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.799
In Matthew chapter number 7, we're nearing the end of the Sermon on the Mount, and of

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:28.600
course there's much that you could look at in these chapters here in the book of Matthew,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.559
and we're nearing the very end of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:36.920
In fact, I mentioned as we were studying on Sunday morning in our Sunday school hour from

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.119
Matthew 8, verses 1 through 4, and how that you understand that there were great multitudes

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:48.320
that followed the Lord Jesus Christ after that teaching on the Sermon on the Mount.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.239
And one of the reasons that so many followed is because He taught them as one having authority

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.559
and not as the scribes.

00:07:55.559 --> 00:08:02.320
But I want you to notice how that Jesus as He ends the Sermon on the Mount and the content

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.480
of all that is contained here in these chapters, and you find that really the preaching begins

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.119
in chapter number 5, and all the way through chapter 5, all the way through chapter 6,

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:19.160
and all the way through chapter 7, and there's so much truth that is given.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.320
And we find that as the conclusion is coming to the Sermon on the Mount, that Jesus says

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.760
this in verse number 24,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:34.599
Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:39.000
unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.479
The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house,

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:44.479
and it fell not.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.840
For it was founded upon a rock.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.440
And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.599
unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand.

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:06.320
The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.280
and it fell.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.479
And great was the fall of it.

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:15.760
We're familiar with this passage of Scripture at the end of Matthew 7.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.640
In fact, we sing a song with the kids about this particular passage of Scripture.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.359
The wise man built his house upon the rock, right?

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:29.359
We sing the song with the children, and we understand the teaching that is given here,

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:34.559
but with regard to, and you see the similarities between even the verbiage that is used by

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:39.640
the Lord Jesus Christ here in these few verses of Scripture with that as we've looked at

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.760
in James 1 and verse 22.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.440
And I want you to notice simply this evening, the message delivered.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.760
The message delivered.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.880
We find that in verse number 24, and again in verse number 26, that the same words are

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.239
used, the same idea.

00:09:55.239 --> 00:10:00.039
Notice what he says, whosoever hereth, notice, these sayings of mine.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.039
of mine."

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:04.999
He says that in v. 24, and then if you skip down to v. 26, he says,

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.719
"...everyone that heareth these sayings of mine."

00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:13.039
We understand that the message here that is being spoken of is the Sermon on the Mount.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:17.919
It's the message, these sayings of mine, it is the message that was delivered by Jesus

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:20.639
Christ Himself.

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:22.679
Now He's God.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.559
He's perfect.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:25.799
Amen?

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:34.239
There are absolute certain times in which you can take note of the deficiencies of the

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:40.539
human delivery individual, the deliverer of the message, the preacher, the pastor.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:48.179
There are times that we, in our failures, we fail to communicate the Word of God appropriately.

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:49.179
No doubt.

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:52.359
We're fallible people.

00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:57.159
But Jesus Christ, He's God.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:59.639
No one ever taught like Him.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:06.519
In fact, the passage ends in v. 29 that He taught as one having authority, not as the

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:09.359
scribes.

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:16.879
And when you read the words in v. 24 and v. 26, "...these sayings of mine," we understand

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:21.999
that the message was delivered, and it was delivered by Jesus Christ.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.679
And I'm thankful that the message was delivered.

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:29.319
I'm thankful that it's not only been delivered to those that were gathered together that

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:34.079
heard Him on that day, but I'm thankful that it's been preserved for us, that we can go

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:40.519
and we can read the content of these sayings of mine that Jesus is referencing here in

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:45.719
this concluding statement of this wonderful message.

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:47.519
We find that the message was delivered.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:51.139
I'd say this, number two, the message was received.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:53.059
It was heard.

00:11:53.059 --> 00:12:00.179
I want you to notice that in v. 24, again, it says, "...whosoever heareth these sayings

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:02.059
of mine."

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:07.939
If you look in v. 26, it does not use the word whosoever, it uses the phrase everyone,

00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:12.539
but notice it says, "...that heareth."

00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:18.619
The problem was not with the receiving of the message, correct?

00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:25.379
No doubt, the problem was not with the delivery of the message.

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:29.539
That was spot on, that's perfect, that's delivered by God Himself.

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:34.859
But we think about the receiving of the message, and we find here that this message was received,

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:41.059
that Jesus says, "...whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and everyone that heareth

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:44.339
these sayings of mine."

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:48.599
In James 1, in v. 22, where we started this evening, that we're to be doers of the Word

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:52.919
noticed and not hearers only.

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:58.399
You know how many people hear truth and never act upon it?

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:01.119
It's sad.

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:02.119
It's sad.

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:07.959
I had a man many years ago, it was probably 15 years ago now, I was not living in Virginia,

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:13.159
I didn't even know where Oakton was, so you probably don't know the individual.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:20.919
And I remember his wife faithfully attended our church, and he would not come to our church.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.919
And I remember I'd visit with him occasionally, and I remember on one particular evening,

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:31.639
I went to visit with this individual, and we had a nice conversation, and a nice man.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:36.959
And I just asked him plainly, we had spoken several times, and I just plainly said to

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:41.039
him, sir, why don't you come to church?

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:46.359
And here's what his response was, I don't want to be responsible for what I hear.

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:49.959
That's what he said to me.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:54.759
I don't want to be responsible for what I hear.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:59.559
I was, so 15 years ago, I was 26, it might have been a little bit longer than that, I

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:02.199
might have been a little younger, so I was like, what?

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:06.479
I never heard something like this before, right?

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:11.599
And I sat there a little bit stunned at the man's response.

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:15.919
And I sat there for a moment, and it seems like maybe 5 or 10 seconds of silence, and

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:19.959
you know 5 or 10 seconds of silence in that moment can feel like an eternity.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:25.519
And we just kind of sat there, and I said, sir, with all due respect, I believe that

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:33.719
you're accountable for the truth, whether you come and hear it or not.

00:14:33.719 --> 00:14:41.479
And as we continued to have that conversation, the arguments were given and everything boiled

00:14:41.479 --> 00:14:44.159
down, and here's what it boiled down to.

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:48.559
He was not going to be a doer of the Word.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.999
And so therefore, why am I going to hear it?

00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:53.919
Because I just don't want to be responsible for it.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:55.799
That's tragic.

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:58.199
That is sad.

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:03.679
It's a sad thing when the people of God hear the preaching and the teaching of the Word

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:07.679
of God, and they fail to apply it.

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:10.759
The message is delivered, the message is received.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:16.079
I would say this, as I mentioned a moment ago, that the delivery of this message here

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:22.399
in Matthew 7, 5, 6, and 7 is a perfect delivery because it's delivered by Jesus Christ.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:28.679
No doubt there are flaws in God's messengers today, but if God's messengers use God's Word,

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:34.479
then I would submit to you this evening that though there may be a flaw in the delivery,

00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:38.439
there's no flaw in the message.

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:43.359
That's why it's my responsibility and it's the responsibility of those that would answer

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:47.159
the call that we are to preach the Word.

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:48.159
That's our job.

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:49.519
That's our duty.

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:52.219
And there's not a problem with God's Word.

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:54.759
You may find fault with the delivery.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:58.399
You may say, well, it could have been said like this, or maybe you should have this,

00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.399
or maybe that.

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.399
And you can take fault.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:10.199
But if you sit and you simply try to criticize the preacher, you miss the message.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:16.199
And here we find that Jesus says, the message has been delivered.

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:18.959
These sayings of mine, they were delivered.

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.359
The message had been received.

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:21.359
It was received.

00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:22.359
It was heard.

00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:27.919
It says, whosoever heareth these sayings, and everyone that heareth these sayings.

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:34.199
The question, however, is whether or not the message would be applied.

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:37.199
Will it be applied?

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:44.599
The reality is that here, the difference in verse 24 and 25 versus verse 26 and verse

00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:49.839
27, the difference is in just a simple word.

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:55.819
You find in verse number 24, it says, and doeth them.

00:16:55.819 --> 00:17:02.539
But in verse number 26, you read, and doeth them not.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:05.339
One word makes all the difference.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.699
And I would submit to you that the word in verse number 24 and the word in verse number

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:16.779
26 is what impacts the word in verse number 25 and the word in verse number 27.

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:22.699
In verse number 25, you find a word that you do not find in verse number 27.

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:29.899
In verse number 25, you read this, it fell not.

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.339
In verse 25.

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:36.819
In verse 27, you read, it fell.

00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:40.939
So in verse number 24, it says, and doeth them.

00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:48.219
The response of doeth them, of being a doer, of applying the truth that had been delivered,

00:17:48.219 --> 00:17:55.139
these sayings of mine, that one, the Bible says that the result of that is that it fell

00:17:55.139 --> 00:17:56.139
not.

00:17:56.139 --> 00:18:03.899
And God says, I'm going to liken him to a wise man, a wise man.

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:11.499
But the one in verse number 26 where the Bible says, and doeth them not, it says that that

00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:13.819
house it fell.

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.559
It fell.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:18.719
He is likened to a foolish man.

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:24.239
I want you to understand that as you read verse 25 and verse number 27, that in both

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:33.959
cases the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house.

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:41.320
You understand that every individual, every person is going to deal with storms in life.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.719
And trials and difficulties and adversities.

00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:49.799
And Paul says that there's a door that's been opened, but there are many adversaries.

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:52.599
We deal with problems and troubles in life.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:59.359
But we find that here, as the rain descended, as the floods came, and as the winds blew

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:04.959
and beat upon the house, both individuals, both groups of people, if we could broaden

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:07.959
it this evening, they both dealt with the same thing.

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:11.639
Now they both heard the same message.

00:19:11.639 --> 00:19:15.320
They both encountered the same storm.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.599
But there's a great difference in the consequence and the result of what you read with regard

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:25.359
to whether the house stood or not.

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:29.320
And it has everything to do with whether the message is applied.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.880
That we're to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.679
I would submit to you this evening that this is not just a truth that we would seek to

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:43.239
look at within the context of hearing a message delivered in a church service.

00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:48.359
Though it's applicable in that account as the Word of God is preached and proclaimed

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:51.320
that there ought to be a response to the Word of God.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.199
That there ought to be a desire on the part of the people of God to not just hear the

00:19:55.199 --> 00:20:00.079
message but to do the message, to apply the message, to be a doer of the Word.

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:07.439
to not be a forgetful hearer, as he says in James 1.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.959
Why are we not a forgetful hearer?

00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:11.279
Because we continue therein.

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:13.439
We're doing the Word of God.

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:18.039
We're applying it in our lives, and yes, that is applicable and appropriate for a response

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:24.199
to a church service, to a preaching, a teaching encounter that we have when the Word of God

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:25.199
is open.

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:28.979
But I would submit to you that this is something that we must take heed to on a daily basis

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:33.619
as we open the Bible in our own daily walk with Christ.

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:38.099
That as we open the Word of God, as we begin to read the Word of God, that we would read

00:20:38.099 --> 00:20:42.779
it not so that we could simply check a box, not so that we could simply say, I had my

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:47.779
devotions, but so that we could find out what is it from this passage, what is it from these

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:51.579
chapters that God is speaking to me about?

00:20:51.579 --> 00:20:56.299
What is it that I need to apply in my life?

00:20:56.299 --> 00:21:03.379
Because I don't just want to be a hearer of the Word, I want to be a doer of the Word.

00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:09.699
We find that as we would look at the account that is given to us in James 1, if you'd turn

00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:14.939
back to that passage of Scripture, you find that, again, this is a verse of Scripture

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:16.539
that is often rehearsed.

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:21.179
It's a verse that oftentimes we simply say that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.179
only.

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:29.139
And far too often, myself included, I will leave out those last words of the verse, deceiving

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:31.139
your own selves.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:39.179
I had a man many years ago say to me at the end of a message, Preacher, that was a great

00:21:39.179 --> 00:21:40.179
sermon.

00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:42.819
I'm glad my wife was here.

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:47.419
I just avoided it like the plague, amen, because I don't want to go down that avenue as to

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:50.379
what it was that he was so thankful for.

00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:57.499
But the reality is that, again, it's not that I come to church and hope that the Preacher

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:02.299
preaches a message that's really going to take care of the problem in my spouse or in

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:03.299
my child.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:06.459
I come to church saying, God, how are you going to speak to me?

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:07.939
How are you going to work in my heart?

00:22:07.939 --> 00:22:12.539
What are you going to show me from your Word that I need to do?

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.339
How do I respond to what God's Word says?

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:21.499
Listen, I don't want to be the man, as we find in verse 23 and 24, that goes and looks

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:28.819
into the glass and he beholds his natural face, but then he walks away and straightway

00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:33.759
immediately forgetteth what manner of man he is.

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:39.459
Why is it that we take time at the end of our Sunday services, both morning and evening,

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:47.659
to have a time of invitation to give you an opportunity to respond?

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:51.499
Sometimes we shy away from going to the old-fashioned altar.

00:22:51.499 --> 00:22:54.019
Somebody might think negatively of us.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:23:00.139
We're all sinners saved by grace, amen?

00:23:00.139 --> 00:23:07.199
And oh, that we just say, God, how did you speak to me this morning, this evening, when

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:13.279
we go to church, that we have that attitude, that anticipation of, Lord, I'm asking that

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:19.239
you'd speak to me and show me and reveal to me and help me with your grace and with your

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:25.119
power to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only.

00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:30.439
I believe that as we respond to truth that is given, as we are doers of the Word, that

00:23:30.439 --> 00:23:34.839
God continues to reveal truth to us in His Word.

00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:36.439
He continues to teach us.

00:23:36.439 --> 00:23:37.439
Why?

00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:40.399
Because we're responding to the truth that He's already revealed to us.

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:44.319
And as we respond to that truth and as we apply that truth and as we're doers of the

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:49.399
Word, not only will we be blessed according to verse number 25, but we find that God will

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:57.479
continue to work in our heart, continue to give us the instruction that we need.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:06.239
I hope this evening that each of us recognize that we're not perfect, amen?

00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:08.079
That God is still working on us.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:15.939
There is a process that we refer to, the theological term of the progressive sanctification.

00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:22.879
I'm thankful that positionally I'm sanctified, but the reality is from a practical standpoint,

00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:28.139
I am daily being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:32.799
And there's not one of us that's perfect, and every one of us need the Word of God and

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.799
need to apply the Word of God.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:41.079
And as we take, listen, the message is delivered, the message is received, it's heard, but is

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:43.199
the message applied?

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:49.839
Are we taking the time personally in our devotions as we go to the Word of God and say, okay,

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:52.719
God, what are you teaching me from this passage?

00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:56.499
What are you trying to draw my attention to?

00:24:56.499 --> 00:24:58.519
What is it that I need to stop doing?

00:24:58.519 --> 00:25:00.679
What is it that I need to start doing?

00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:06.999
How is it that I can take the truth of your Word and be a doer of the Word and not a hearer

00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:09.439
only?

00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:13.719
This book, as I've said many times over the years, is not a book of theory.

00:25:13.719 --> 00:25:18.199
It's a book of practice.

00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:23.959
It's not just a theory book that, you know, these are all these theories that have been

00:25:23.959 --> 00:25:26.759
put into a volume that we call the Bible.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:29.079
No, it's a book of practice.

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:31.519
It's a book of applying.

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:36.759
And as we are students of the Word and as we are digging into the Word, then we're finding

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:43.279
how do we take and apply these truths in our lives, not deceiving our own selves.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.999
Last week on Wednesday evening, we looked at that passage of Scripture in Mark chapter

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:53.239
number 12, where those Sadducees, the title last week was, ye therefore do greatly err.

00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:56.599
And remember those Sadducees, they did not believe in the resurrection, but yet they

00:25:56.599 --> 00:26:00.159
come to Jesus and they think they have Him cornered right where they want Him.

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:04.119
And they say, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be?

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:08.919
Because all of these brothers had her and there were no seed raised up, and so whose

00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:11.119
wife will she be?

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:13.639
And Jesus said, ye err, not knowing the Scriptures.

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:17.639
See, as we know the Scriptures, what does it mean to know them?

00:26:17.639 --> 00:26:26.099
It's not just a mental aptitude that's being spoken of, it's that application of the truth.

00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:30.339
Jesus says, ye did not know the truth, ye greatly err, and then He says to them in

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:35.939
Mark 12, as He's speaking to them and responding to them, He says, He's not the God of the

00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:39.059
dead, but of the living.

00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:43.679
So as they would take the truth that had been revealed to them and they would be doers and

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:48.739
apply the principles, they would understand that there is a resurrection, but yet they

00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:49.739
deny the resurrection.

00:26:49.739 --> 00:26:54.699
That's what Jesus was getting at with those disciples, or excuse me, those Sadducees.

00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:59.579
We find here this evening that as we look at this passage of Scripture, no doubt each

00:26:59.579 --> 00:27:04.579
one of us can look back on our walk with God and our Christian life and we can say, I have

00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:08.959
heard a lot of truth.

00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:14.459
We are not in a place where truth is unavailable.

00:27:14.459 --> 00:27:18.219
Aren't you thankful for that, by the way?

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:22.579
There may come a time where they try to silence our voices.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:27.939
There's certain countries around the world in which they seek to do that.

00:27:27.939 --> 00:27:33.859
I was speaking with someone yesterday and they were asking some questions about the

00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:39.099
potential of some of that type of thing being done and I said, well, at that point you can

00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:42.179
forget about live stream.

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.979
That'll go out the window, right?

00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:51.619
I'm not going to let you broadcast truth if they're trying to silence you.

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:55.699
There are countries around the world that we have missionaries in where truth is not

00:27:55.699 --> 00:28:00.499
available like it is here, that you can't stand up with the level of freedom that we

00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:03.979
have and proclaim truth.

00:28:03.979 --> 00:28:08.019
But it's not about just being a hearer of truth.

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:11.979
We're to be doers of the Word, not hearers only.

00:28:11.979 --> 00:28:18.259
Notice, deceiving your own selves.

00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:22.099
I don't want someone else to deceive me.

00:28:22.099 --> 00:28:26.979
I certainly don't want to deceive myself, right?

00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:28.859
I don't want someone to deceive me.

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:32.099
I don't like being deceived.

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:38.699
But how tragic, how tragic if we deceive our own selves.

00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:44.339
I've often said that the worst deception is self-deception.

00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:49.619
You know, many times when we deceive ourselves, we don't even know it.

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:52.259
We're just completely blinded to it.

00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:59.859
Oh, that God would help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only deceiving our

00:28:59.859 --> 00:29:00.859
own selves.

00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:04.099
God, I want you to speak to me and I want you to make it plain.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:08.339
Show me how to apply the truth that you've given me.

00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:12.939
Help me to make a commitment to be a doer of the Word that when your spirit, we sing

00:29:12.939 --> 00:29:16.099
the song, I'll say, yes, Lord, yes.

00:29:16.099 --> 00:29:19.179
To your will and to your way, I'll say, yes, Lord, yes.

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:24.619
When your spirit speaks to me, with my whole heart, I'll agree.

00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:30.859
And my answer will be, yes, Lord, yes.

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:34.379
I'm going to be a doer of the Word, not a hearer only.

00:29:34.379 --> 00:29:36.139
I don't want to deceive myself.

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:37.139
Let's pray.

00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:39.779
Father, we love you this evening and we thank you for loving us.

00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:42.379
We thank you for giving us truth.

00:29:42.379 --> 00:29:44.299
We thank you for the Sermon on the Mount.

00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:51.139
As we read those wonderful passages of Scripture in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, we're mindful as we

00:29:51.139 --> 00:29:57.699
come to the end of that passage as we study this evening, the message was delivered, the

00:29:57.699 --> 00:29:58.979
message was received.

00:29:58.979 --> 00:30:05.019
But the critical aspect of that passage of Scripture is whether or not the message would

00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:07.899
be applied.

00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:13.739
There were some that heard, and they doeth them.

00:30:13.739 --> 00:30:18.399
They respond by being a doer of the Word.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:26.319
Their house fell not, stood, it withstood the storms, the trials, were likened unto

00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:28.999
a wise man.

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:36.839
There's another group of people that in like manner heard the message, but doeth them not.

00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:39.199
The house fell.

00:30:39.199 --> 00:30:41.719
Foolish.

00:30:41.719 --> 00:30:44.199
God thank you for truth.

00:30:44.199 --> 00:30:46.679
Help us to be doers of the Word.

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:49.959
Thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:53.599
Thank you that you hear and answer prayer.

00:30:53.599 --> 00:30:59.239
Thank you that you're able to do exceeding, abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:06.079
I pray this evening that as we engage in corporate prayer that you would bless, encourage us,

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:10.559
and strengthen us, and we'll thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:11.559
we pray.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:12.559
Amen.

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.479
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:15.919
You don't have one?
