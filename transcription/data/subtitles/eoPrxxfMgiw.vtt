WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
and enter into the third chapter.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.320
And many of you know that the verse and chapter divisions

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.439
were entered for the ease of reading.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.239
I believe as you study the passage

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.399
that we're looking at this morning,

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.000
though there's a chapter division,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.479
the content flows very closely

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:20.280
associated one with the other.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.639
And so we'll look at chapter two,

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:22.760
beginning in verse number 28,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.639
down through chapter number three and verse number three.

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.319
And we'll look at these verses this morning.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.620
You'll recall last week we addressed the false teachers

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.639
that sought to infiltrate and corrupt the church.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.939
And we noted how that those false teachers were described.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.860
We also noted what it was

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.939
that those false teachers desired.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.220
Remember, John says that you have heard

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.319
that antichrist shall come,

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.860
even now are there many antichrist.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500
He describes them as antichrist,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.259
he describes them as liars.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.340
We find that their desire is to seduce you.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.259
And we find that God has given us

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.340
not only the word of God,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.020
but the Holy Spirit of God

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.019
who enables us to understand and to evaluate truth

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.019
and to be able to identify false teaching

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:13.379
and to avoid that false teaching.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.099
And for that, we ought to rejoice.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:16.779
And the reality is that really,

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:18.440
as we look at the passage of scripture

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.940
that we studied last week,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.360
and the truth that is given to us there

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.940
and how it segues into what we're dealing with this morning,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.599
you've heard that antichrist shall come,

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.500
even now are there many antichrist.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.959
And I think about it from this perspective,

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.940
the reality is that yes, antichrist will come.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.940
We dealt with some of that

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.139
at the end of the message last week,

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.339
but we understand that God has given us

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.900
responsibility for today

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.139
and what it is that we're to do.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.779
And he says, listen, there are many antichrist today,

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:52.180
that false teachers that are so prevalent.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.940
And sometimes we can be so consumed with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.120
and enamored with future events

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.459
that we fail to recognize

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.459
that God has given us marching orders for today.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.980
And the truth is even the same

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.660
as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.100
that is we look this morning

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.240
and dealing with the return of Christ.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.380
We don't know when the Lord Jesus is going to come,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.880
but we know that he is going to come.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.380
And the impact of that truth

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.699
is to affect us today for our living today

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.619
and what we do with the truth that we have.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.440
We're not seeking to set dates,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.300
we're told that no man knows the hour,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.080
but we do believe that we're living in those last days.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320
We do believe that the return of the Lord is soon,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.259
it's imminent.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.020
We believe that the trumpet of the Lord

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.639
could sound at any time

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.279
before the close of this service,

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.259
before we pillow our head this evening,

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.940
before we start this work week,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.860
the Lord Jesus could appear.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.619
And for that, we ought to rejoice,

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.380
but we ought to be motivated

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.740
to live a godly, pure, and clean life.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.639
As we look at this passage of scripture,

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.639
we're mindful of the text

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.639
and the truth of what John will deal with,

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.259
but I do want to remind you

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.460
that James tells us this in James 4 in verse number eight,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.139
that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
Paul says this in Hebrews 10 in verse number 38,

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.380
for yet a little while,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.380
and he that shall come will come

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.580
and will not tarry.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.220
He's coming right on time.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.779
He's not gonna be a minute late.

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:24.979
He's not gonna be a minute early.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.500
He's coming right on time.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.839
And we don't know the time,

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.619
but we do know that he's going to return.

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:31.740
I think about this,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.039
are we fulfilling the truth

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.220
that's been given to us here in Titus 2 in verse number 13,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.220
that we are looking for that blessed hope

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.320
and the glorious appearing of the great God

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.979
and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.419
I mean, looking for his return,

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.940
anticipating his return,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.699
understanding that today could be the day.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.320
And what joy that is.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.380
And this morning,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.259
as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.259
I'm going to use as our title from verse number 28,

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.160
when he shall appear.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.300
Notice in verse number 28,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.139
the Bible says,

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.639
and now little children abide in him.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.740
This is a recurring statement, by the way,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.380
and how important it is that we recognize our need

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.619
for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.519
that we are simply the branches and he is the vine,

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.079
and we're to abide in him.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.320
John heard the Lord Jesus Christ speak those words

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.079
in John 15 and how we need to abide in him.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:29.079
Notice it says that when he shall appear,

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.519
we may have confidence

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:35.040
and not be ashamed before him that is coming.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.399
If you know that he is righteous,

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:40.160
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.059
is born of him.

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.160
Behold, what manner of love

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.339
the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.500
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.220
Therefore, the world knoweth us not

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.019
because it knew him not.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:57.220
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.559
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.220
but we know, we know what?

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.739
We know that when he shall appear,

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:06.579
we shall be like him,

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.820
for we shall see him as he is.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.619
And every man that hath this hope in him

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.619
purifieth himself even as he is pure.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.760
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.100
I want you to notice first of all

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.619
the certainty of his return.

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.299
I want you to notice the phrases that are used here.

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.720
In verse number 28, we see it,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.619
the Bible says when he shall appear.

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:32.700
We notice in chapter number three,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.220
actually in verse number 28,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.500
again at the end of the verse,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.220
it says not be ashamed before him.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.399
Notice this at his coming.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.799
We notice when he shall appear in verse number 28,

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:44.820
again in verse number 28 at his coming.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.359
And then in verse number two of chapter number three,

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.420
again he says when he shall appear.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.940
When we note the certainty of his return,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.640
we note the words in which John is using.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.619
There's no doubt whatsoever in John's mind

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.160
that Jesus is going to return.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.920
It's interesting as you look at this passage of scripture

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.119
that really this is not a theological discourse

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:08.760
on the subject of the second,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.440
of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.959
It's not a theological discourse.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:15.239
He's just giving a statement

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:17.119
that is filled with confidence,

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.160
that is filled with certainty.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.079
We look at a number of other passages

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:24.320
and you can see some just great truth

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.239
that is given with regard to the return of Christ.

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:30.559
And here we find that John is simply stating

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.119
with confidence and with certainty

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.200
when he shall appear at his coming,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.000
when he shall appear.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.160
And you see he's not seeking to argue with anyone.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.320
He's not seeking to prove anything.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.100
He's just absolutely speaking the truth

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.700
that Jesus is coming again.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.440
If you don't believe it, well then that's your problem.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.839
I mean, I almost kind of get that sense from John

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.880
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.640
that he's just saying this is certain,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.660
this is going to happen.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.399
We find that John has already given us this truth

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.119
in 1 John chapter number one.

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.760
Notice, remember this morning that he says this,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.959
that which was from the beginning in verse number one,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.959
remember he says this, which we have heard,

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.760
which we have seen with our eyes,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.279
which we have looked upon,

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.359
and our hands have handled of the word of life.

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:21.880
Remember again, he says in verse number three,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.140
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.359
that ye also may have fellowship with us

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:30.559
and truly our fellowship is with the Father

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:32.660
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.019
John is an eyewitness.

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.540
He said in the very beginning of this book

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.420
that he is providing an eyewitness account,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.579
that which I've heard, that which I've seen,

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:45.880
that which I've handled, I'm declaring it unto you,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.940
I'm giving you this eyewitness account,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.140
and he's stating the facts of the return of Christ

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.100
in this passage of Scripture.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.579
I want you to think about John just for a moment.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.380
Turn back to the book of John, if you will,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.100
and I want you to go back to John chapter number 14.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.779
It's a precious truth that we have,

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:06.660
and we're mindful that in chapter number two earlier,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.820
he had spoken about that command of loving our brethren,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.619
and the fact that if you abide in him,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.579
if you're walking in the light, here's the test,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.799
here's the evidence that you're gonna love your brother.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.700
And right on the heels of that truth

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.579
that Jesus gave in John chapter number 13,

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:25.660
we find that we come to John chapter number 14

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.299
in the first three verses,

00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:31.040
when Jesus said, let not your heart be troubled.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.500
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.619
In my Father's house are many mansions,

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.000
if it were not so, I would have told you,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.020
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.099
He says, if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:47.659
I will come again and receive you unto myself,

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:50.159
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.219
Now, John heard those words.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.140
John was there in John chapter number 14.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.820
He was there in chapter number 13.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.859
He was there when Jesus washed the feet of the disciples.

00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:02.179
He was there when Jesus said,

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.580
I give you a new commandment that you love,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.440
not as yourself, don't love your neighbors yourself,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.900
but love as I have loved,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.460
that you love also one another in the same manner

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.479
in which I have loved, and by this truth,

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:18.020
by this action, by this love,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.419
all men will know that you're my disciples.

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:22.659
And we find that Jesus then speaks

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:25.780
these words of great comfort,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.659
let not your heart be troubled.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.559
He says, I will come again.

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:33.140
Now, I believe that as we look to John 14

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.539
in verses one through three,

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:36.419
we read those verses of scripture

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:39.299
and we receive from those verses comfort.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:42.419
We receive from those verses confidence.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:46.500
And I believe that John too had a measure of comfort

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.099
as he recalled those words of Jesus in John 14,

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:54.460
a measure of confidence when he says there to his readers,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.179
he says that when he shall appear,

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:59.619
he heard Jesus say, I'm gonna come again.

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:04.519
Remember, in John chapter 21, turn over a few pages, if you will, and notice in John

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:11.719
chapter 21, most of this chapter, especially the latter part of John chapter 21, is given

00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:17.199
to us with regard to the discussion, the dialogue between the Lord Jesus Christ and Peter.

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:20.239
Remember, he says to Peter, do you love me?

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:24.879
We read that discourse, but I want you to understand that John was there, for John,

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:27.659
as it says in John 21 and verse number 22.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:33.699
Notice in verse 21, Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:34.699
Who's he referring to?

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:39.219
Well, if you look in verse number 20, it says, then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple

00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:41.819
whom Jesus loved following.

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:45.979
That's how John referred to himself, isn't that wonderful?

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:50.619
The disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:53.259
We sang in Sunday school this morning, Jesus loves me.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:56.699
We sang the B-I-B-L-E as well, but man, just think about the love.

00:10:56.699 --> 00:11:01.099
We're going to see it as we continue into chapter number 3 in 1 John, but Peter sees

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:07.499
John and Peter says to Jesus, after he sees John, Lord, what shall this man do?

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:12.319
Notice in verse number 22 that Jesus saith unto him, if I will that he tarry, notice

00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:16.739
these words, till I come, what is that to thee?

00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:17.739
Follow thou me.

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:19.779
But I want you to think about the impact.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:25.219
We understand, I've preached before about Peter's situation here and how Peter needs

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:26.499
to avoid the distractions.

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:28.739
He doesn't need to worry about other people.

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:31.979
Sometimes in our lives we get so concerned about, well, I know God told me to do this,

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:32.979
but what are you going to do?

00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:33.979
And what are they going to do?

00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:34.979
And what about them?

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:35.979
And what about this person?

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:37.979
And Peter asked the Lord, what about John?

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:40.179
And Jesus says, what does it matter to you?

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.179
You follow me.

00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:46.619
But I want you to think about the impact of John hearing these words, because what John

00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:50.219
heard was, if I will that he tarry, till I come.

00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:53.499
Now there were some that took this and said that he wasn't going to die until Jesus came,

00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:55.019
but that's not what Jesus said.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:59.019
Jesus simply was saying to Peter, if that's what happens, it doesn't matter to you.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:01.539
You need to follow me.

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:02.699
But John heard those words.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:06.219
He heard in John 14, let not your heart be troubled.

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:08.179
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:11.019
In my Father's house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:12.779
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.259
And if I go, what does he say?

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:19.539
I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:27.139
Now he hears Jesus in John 21 say, if I will that he tarry till I come.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:31.419
Notice in Acts chapter number one, we're familiar with the passage of scripture as we read of

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:34.699
the ascension of Jesus Christ when he ascended up into heaven.

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:38.379
And what a great truth that is given to us in this portion of scripture.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:42.259
You can read the end of the book of Luke and see it as well in Luke chapter number

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:43.259
24.

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:48.299
But I want you to see in verse number six here of Acts one, it says, when they therefore

00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:53.559
were come together, they asked of him saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:55.339
the kingdom to Israel?

00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:59.099
And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father

00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:04.699
hath put in his own power, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:07.860
And you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and all Judean and Samarian and

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.539
to the outermost part of the earth.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.979
And sometimes we're focused on verse number six and not verse number eight.

00:13:12.979 --> 00:13:16.339
We're wondering when Jesus is going to do the next thing and when this is going to happen.

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:20.239
And we fail doing what they're supposed to be doing today.

00:13:20.239 --> 00:13:22.539
We're so concerned about what's going to happen during the tribulation.

00:13:22.539 --> 00:13:24.539
I ain't going to be here.

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:25.539
Amen.

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.659
I can tell you what's going to happen.

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:27.739
I can read revelation.

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:31.739
I can talk to you about the seals and the trumpets and the vials and the bowls.

00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:33.360
I can give you all that truth.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.500
But the reality is that I got a job today.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.899
And so, you know, I'm not saying that we avoid prophecy.

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:40.659
I'm simply saying that we keep it in its right context.

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:45.979
We can get so focused on what's going to happen in the future that we fail to do what we're

00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:46.979
supposed to do today.

00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.059
And the disciples are saying, Jesus, is it now time that you're going to set up your

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:51.059
kingdom?

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:54.299
And Jesus said, it's not for you to know the time nor the seasons.

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.819
Here's what your marching orders are.

00:13:55.819 --> 00:13:57.220
Here's what your responsibility is.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.419
You're going to receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you're to be

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:01.419
my witnesses.

00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:02.419
Amen?

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:09.500
Can I tell you this morning, it's the same job that we have today, same responsibility.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.619
But then in verse 9, and when He had spoken these things, while they beheld, He was taken

00:14:15.619 --> 00:14:16.619
up.

00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:22.540
A cloud received Him out of their sight, and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.019
as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:34.179
Can you imagine being there at the ascension of Jesus Christ and watching Him as He had

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:35.699
ascended to heaven?

00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:38.540
And they're just standing there in awe and amazement.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.260
It says that they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.899
It tells us in verse number 11 that these two that stood there, here's what they said,

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.179
ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:53.820
Notice what John would hear again.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:05.220
This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.540
you have seen Him go into heaven.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.619
Now review just briefly with me this morning.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:16.899
John hears the Lord Jesus Christ in John 14 give that great discourse and says, I will

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.260
come again.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.779
John hears the Lord Jesus Christ as He's speaking to Peter, saying to Peter, what is it to you?

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:28.139
If I will that He tarry till I come.

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:33.419
And then at the ascension of Jesus Christ, John hears these two angels as they're standing

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:38.899
and beholding as the Lord has taken up that he then hears these angels say, this same

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:45.260
Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Him go into heaven.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.220
Do you understand why John has confidence and certainty?

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.220
Amen?

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.739
I mean, he is absolutely certain.

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:55.859
He's not doubting for one moment.

00:15:55.859 --> 00:16:00.739
Remember the Bible tells us in Peter, excuse me, we find that, yeah, Peter deals with the

00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:03.139
fact, he says, listen, there are going to be scoffers, there are going to be mockers,

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:07.100
they're going to say, where is the promise of His return?

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.619
But the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness.

00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:14.899
But He's longsuffering to us, Lord, not willing that any should perish, but that all should

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:16.019
come to repentance.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:18.459
Jesus is going to come.

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:21.940
And we find that John is absolutely certain.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.179
He's confident of it.

00:16:23.619 --> 00:16:29.779
He says, when He shall appear, at His coming, when He shall appear.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:32.459
This morning, do you have that same level of certainty?

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:35.739
Do you have that same level of confidence?

00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:42.179
Jesus spoke those words and the angels spoke those words and John heard those words and

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:45.660
they had a profound impact in his life.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.660
This morning, we need to have that same level of certainty.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.380
We need to have that level of confidence that my Lord is coming again.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.459
I don't know when, but man, I know He's coming again.

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:04.540
And oh, what a glory it would be if it would be in our lifetime, amen, if we would hear

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.019
the trumpet of the Lord sound.

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:08.019
What a blessing.

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:11.419
I want you to think about, even as it had an impact on John, think about the impact

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:12.419
on the believer.

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:15.579
Number two, if you're taking notes this morning, we see the certainty of His return, but then

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.339
notice the impact on the believer.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:22.339
I believe this morning that as you consider the certainty of God's Word with regard to

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.619
the subject matter that is before us this morning, that it should have a powerful impact

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.699
in our lives.

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:31.459
We should live every day with the awareness that today could be the day.

00:17:31.459 --> 00:17:36.079
We should understand as we look at this passage of Scripture, how that John is communicating

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:41.899
to his readers, to these recipients of this letter, to us by way of preservation, that

00:17:41.899 --> 00:17:44.479
Jesus is coming again.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.959
How does that impact us?

00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:49.760
What level of impact does that have on our lives?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.359
Notice what he says in verse number 28, and now little children abide in Him, that when

00:17:55.359 --> 00:18:01.760
He shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.760
We notice that what will enable us to not be ashamed before Him at His coming is given

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.000
to us not only here in verse number 28, but also in verse number 3 of chapter 3.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.760
Notice in verse 28 that we abide in Him, that we abide in Him.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.639
As we abide in Him, that's going to enable us to not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

00:18:19.639 --> 00:18:24.679
As we follow the instruction in verse number 3 of chapter number 3, that we purify ourselves,

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:28.720
and we'll get to that in just a moment, but if we go through that process and we're walking

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.119
in holiness and purity, we will not be ashamed of disappearing.

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:38.520
But as I look at verse number 28, it seems to me that it is possible that a person of

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:46.159
God, a child of God, could be ashamed at His coming because He says, abide in Him,

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:51.719
that when He shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:58.799
Wouldn't it be a sad thing to be ashamed at His coming?

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.400
I mean, honestly.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.799
We can use illustrations and analogies this morning in thinking about someone walking

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.679
in prematurely, maybe a child given a task.

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:14.559
We often use that illustration and the parents giving a prescribed time when they would return

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:19.559
and the parents return sooner than those children had anticipated.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:21.000
It's not a joyful moment.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.479
It's not a, oh, we're so glad to see you.

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:27.080
It's a, I thought it was going to be an extra little bit of time before you got back.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.839
Listen, I don't want to be ashamed before Him at His appearing, amen?

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:38.119
But it seems, as you look at the verse of Scripture, that it's certainly possible that

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:41.599
we could be ashamed at His appearing.

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:43.320
But He gives us the instruction.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.719
He says, listen, I want you to understand the certainty of this, but it ought to impact

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:52.000
you because the reality is we don't want to be ashamed.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.359
We don't want to be ashamed at His coming, at His appearing.

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:59.520
Notice in verse 29, if you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone that do

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.780
righteousness is born of Him, and aren't you thankful that our God is righteous?"

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:10.260
Whoa, what a blessing. He's not becoming righteous, He is righteous. Let me tell

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.700
you, He's imputed His righteousness upon us. He hath made us, declared us to be

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.980
righteous, and what a blessing. And He says that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.260
is born of Him, and what a blessing to know the work. Remember, we mentioned this

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.020
in chapter number two, where He talked about the love of God being

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.380
perfected in Him, and how God works in us, and that internal work, and doing the

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.140
righteousness, and we're born of Him. And we continue going through the passage of

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.840
Scripture, and getting into the first verse of chapter number three, and notice

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.960
what He says, "'Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.360
should be called the sons of God.'" Isn't that amazing? When you think about the love

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:05.680
of God, "'Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:13.840
be called the sons of God.'" We spoke in the second chapter earlier, in verse

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.840
number twelve, and we spoke about the fact that those little children, He was

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.320
writing to them, because your sins are forgiven for His namesake, but then He

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.680
also says to the little children, that you know you have known the Father. And

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.520
we spoke about the privilege that it is to know that He's our Father, and

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.640
we're His children. And here we find that John is reminding these recipients that

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:45.200
we are called the sons of God. He says, "'Therefore the world knoweth us not,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.760
because it knew Him not.'" And then He says this in verse number two, "'Beloved, now

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.600
are we the sons of God.'" Remember, as we mentioned there in John chapter 21, how

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.680
was it that John referred to himself, the disciple whom the Lord loveth? And when

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.280
you consider this morning, the approach and the truth that He's giving in

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.480
this passage of Scripture, for us to just pause and just to focus for just a

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.360
moment on the fact that we're loved by God Almighty, with an unconditional love,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:30.120
with an everlasting love. There's a man, years ago, as an evangelist, and he not

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.560
only preached, but he would sing, and he was nearing the end of his life, and it

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.440
was understood that it was probably going to be the last meeting they would ever

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.720
hold, and he was going to sing, and he was going to preach, and many people wondered

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.360
what song it would be that he would sing for that last meeting. And he simply

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.200
stood behind that pulpit, and he sang that little song, "'Jesus Loves Me, This I

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.880
Know.'" Isn't that precious? I understand that we sing it with our children, but it's

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.680
more than just a children's song. You think about that song, "'Jesus Loves Even

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.120
Me,' "'I Am So Glad That My Father in Heaven,' tells of His love in the book He

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:14.480
has given." Aren't you thankful for the love of God? And John says, and we're reminded

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.120
this morning of this love that God has for us, and listen, the Word of God here in 1

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.520
John is going to continue dealing with the subject matter of God's love. In fact, we're

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:30.000
going to read how the Bible says that God is love, and He is. And I'm so thankful, but

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.240
we live in a time, we'll deal with this in additional messages as we go throughout

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.200
the fourth chapter in particular of the book of 1 John, but we live in a time in which

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:46.680
the love of God is often misunderstood. We find that there are many people in our society

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.240
today that want to talk about God as love, but they do not really fully understand what

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:57.860
is meant in the Word of God when God says He is love. I know I've said this before,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.760
but it's worth repeating. I believe this morning that God's love is best described

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:11.040
not as being permissive, but as being protective. See, this morning in our society in which

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.440
we live, most people that want to talk about the love of God, most of those that want to

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.800
harp upon and talk about God as love, they act as if God has sacrificed His holiness

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:30.400
on the altar of love. And God will never sacrifice His holiness on the altar of love. Never.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.360
Our God is holy. He is love. And those two things are in perfect harmony and unity, and

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.800
the reality is that God's love is best described as being protective. Because He loves us,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:48.760
He protects us. Love is not permissive. That's what our society wants us to believe this

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.400
morning. Well, God loves you, and therefore He permits you to do whatever you want to

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.960
do, and you just be happy in Jesus because God loves you. Right? Isn't that the idea?

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:07.220
It's so prevalent in our society today. What parent loves their child and just lets their

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:16.480
child do whatever they want to do? It's not love. I want to go stick a fork in the outlet.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.960
Well, okay, honey, I love you, so if that's what you want to do, go ahead and do it. That's

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:34.160
nonsense. Right? In fact, the parent would be charged with negligence. What's the defense?

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:42.920
I loved them. How's that going to work in court? Right? It's, God says, what, the Word

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.120
of God says, what manner of love, behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:55.740
upon us. He loves us, and He loves us, and He wants to protect us. From what? From all

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:02.540
sorts of things. He wants to protect us from ourselves. Amen? You think about that self-deception?

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.960
We can deceive ourselves. He wants to protect us from the enemy. We have an enemy. He wants

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.940
to protect us from false teachers. He wants to protect us from evil, from error, and we

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:18.260
find that He loves us, and what a blessing to understand the love of God, and when we

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:24.060
properly understand the love of God, and we understand that He's saved us, and He's adopted

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.100
us, and He's our Father, and we're His children. Notice as he continues in verse number two,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.740
beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:39.940
we know. Again, we see this idea of what we know. And remember, John focuses this word

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:45.140
know, or of some form of the word is used repeatedly through the book of 1 John. God

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.860
wants us to know some things. He wants us to know, and notice what He says, but we know

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:58.340
that when He shall appear, again, we see the certainty of this truth, we shall be like

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:07.740
Him, for we shall see Him as He is. That's going to be a wonderful day, when this mortal

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:14.020
shall put off immortality, amen, or put on immortality, excuse me, when this corrupt

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:20.460
should put off the incorrupt. I'm getting this backwards. Let me read 1 Corinthians

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:25.660
15, because I'm going to quote it backwards here, and notice what the word of God says

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:31.020
in 1 Corinthians 15, a great chapter with return to the resurrection. Notice what He

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.380
says in verse number 52, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:40.180
the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, for we shall be

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.740
changed. Notice what He says, for this corruptible must put on incorruption. This mortal must

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:52.260
put on immortality. What a blessing. What a great truth that God gives us in His Word

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.660
with regard to this, what we know, that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.780
we shall see Him as He is. But then notice verse number three, what great truth has been

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.340
given in verse 28, in verse number 29, in verse 1, in verse 2, and we come to verse

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:17.300
number three, and notice what the Bible says, and every man that hath this hope in him,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:29.060
what does it do? How does it impact us? Purifieth himself, even as he is pure. There's a purifying

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.820
effect of this truth, and we see it in verse number three, and I'm thankful that God has

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.500
given us this truth, and I'm thankful that we have this hope in us, as the people of

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.380
God, to understand that this world is not all there is. Aren't you thankful for that?

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:51.260
Amen? That this world is not my home, I'm just a passing through. That the reality that

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:57.880
we're pilgrims and we're strangers, and our heavenly home, and what a joy to consider

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.520
that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, but notice He says, every man that hath

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:17.500
this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure. Purifieth himself. The reality

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:23.320
this morning is that we desire, we should desire, to be pure and clean, as the children

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:34.920
sang. To be pure, to be clean, to understand that, as He gave us the truth in 1 John 1,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.400
that we have that cleansing that He speaks of with regard to the sins in our lives, but

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.960
if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:51.800
us from all unrighteousness. That we're to be pure, that we're to be clean. Why do we

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:58.200
seek to have this process of purifying himself? Because He is pure, and we're to be like Him.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:08.880
We're to walk in holiness, in purity, desiring to be clean, not content with filth and corruption,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.760
not content with sin in our lives.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.120
Amen?

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.240
We don't never get used to just, well, that's just, you know, just going to be okay with

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.080
this.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.800
No.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.000
We have this hope that He's going to return.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.360
And because He's going to return, that we want to live a life that is pure and clean

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.240
before His eyes.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:42.560
Living a life of sin will make us ashamed before Him, it is coming.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.560
I want you to read John chapter number 6, or excuse me, Jeremiah chapter number 6 with

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560
me just for a moment.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.120
According to the Old Testament, I want you to consider in closing the truth that God

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:07.080
gives in Jeremiah chapter number 6 with regard to the people of Israel, Judah in particular

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080
here.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.520
And I want you to notice the warning that is given, the certainty of judgment that is

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.000
laid out.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:22.040
Remember, Jeremiah is prophesying on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:28.040
The Babylonians have besieged, they're around the city, they're ready to take over and Jeremiah

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:34.680
is prophesying and the people are still refusing.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.160
And in Jeremiah 6 and verse number 13, the Bible says, for from the least of them even

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:44.120
unto the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness, and from the prophet even

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.440
unto the priest, everyone dealeth falsely.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.160
That's sad, isn't it?

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.300
What a sad commentary.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.080
From the least of them even unto the greatest, they're given to what?

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.500
To covetousness.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.680
From the prophet even unto the priest, everyone dealeth falsely.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.920
What an indictment.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.640
What a sad commentary.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.200
Verse number 15, notice what the Bible says, were they ashamed when they had committed

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200
abomination?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.560
Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.440
Therefore they shall fall among them that fall, at the time that I visit them they shall

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.480
be cast down, saith the Lord.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.120
Why did I read verse number 15?

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.680
Because the Bible says this, they ask the question, were they ashamed when they had

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.680
committed abomination?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:50.960
And the Bible says, nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.960
I don't ever want to get to that place in my life, and I hope that you don't ever want

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:08.200
to get to that place in your life, where sin, wickedness, doesn't cause us to be ashamed.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.040
Doesn't cause us to blush.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.640
We live in a wicked society, would you not agree?

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.680
But we're in the world, not of the world.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.760
And we ought not be content with the filth of this world.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:30.480
We ought not be to a place where we just kind of get used to it.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.000
And the reality this morning, is when we think about that truth in Jeremiah 6, and we think

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.520
about this truth of 1 John 2 and 3, as we consider the return of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:48.360
when He shall appear, I don't know the hour when He's going to come, and neither do you.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:55.000
But I would not want to be found doing something, engaged in something, that I ought not be

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.760
engaged in, that would cause shame at His coming.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.760
Amen?

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.400
I remember when I worked in the workplace, there'd be times, I never understood this,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.720
but there'd be times when we'd be sitting in the offices there, and people would say,

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.320
hey, so-and-so's coming, pretend like you're working.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.920
We're supposed to be working, aren't we?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.920
What do you mean, pretend?

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.040
What are they trying to do?

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.400
Well, they know that the presence of a superior is in the vicinity, and therefore we're going

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:33.160
to…God sees us all the time, but one day He's coming.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.480
I don't know when He's coming, and neither do you.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.440
And the reality this morning is that this truth, the certainty of His return, the confidence

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:49.160
by which John is speaking of these truths this morning, ought to impact us.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.360
I believe it impacted John.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.160
I believe that it impacted the disciples.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.200
When we read of the book of Acts, if you read the entirety of the book of Acts, you

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.520
will be absolutely amazed at what the people of God accomplished in the first century through

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.820
the power of God.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.320
As the people of God were surrendered to the will of God and enabled by the power of God,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.800
they turned the world upside down.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.120
That's what the Bible tells us.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:24.040
Those that had given the criteria to the disciples that you're not to speak any longer in His

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.760
name, they had given them that threat, we find that those same people come and say,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.440
you've filled Jerusalem with this doctrine.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.000
What motivated the first century church?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.880
What motivated the disciples and the believers?

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.520
What motivated them is that when they watched Jesus ascend into heaven, they heard the angel

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.400
say He's coming again.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.120
And they didn't know when.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.080
And this morning, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.120
Sometimes if we're not careful, because of the length of time that has elapsed, we can

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.160
kind of just get comfortable in our routine and we can just get comfortable in life and

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.200
this is just what we're doing and this is how life is going.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:11.040
And sometimes we can live without that expectation that today could be the day.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.559
But what if He came today?

00:36:14.559 --> 00:36:16.940
Are we ready for His appearing?

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.880
Are you ready this morning?

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:24.080
If Jesus were to return right now, are you ready?

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.000
I know that it's easy for each of us to say, yeah, I'm ready, but man, when we really evaluate

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.960
and take that step back and begin to evaluate our lives, are we ready?

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.860
Are we ready for the coming of the Lord?

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.040
The impact on every believer is given to us in verse number three, that every man that

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:51.840
hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:59.360
If there's any measure of hesitation in answering that question this morning, are you ready

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.559
for His return?

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:05.520
Respond to that.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.440
Ask God to help you to deal with whatever that is because you say, well, I'm not sure

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.480
if I'm ready for Him to return.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.480
There's a hesitation.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.320
I might be ashamed of His appearing.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.760
Deal with it.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:22.680
Let the Holy Spirit have His way and let God help you to be in a place where the truth

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:28.160
is impacting you and that we're living a clean and pure life.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.480
I heard David Gibbs say this a number of years ago.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.040
Some of you know David Gibbs, he's an attorney for Religious Liberties, he's a great preacher

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040
as well.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.520
If you've ever heard him preach, he's very eloquent, but he's got the power of God.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.760
And he made this statement and it was quite impactful.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.760
He said, you know what the problem is that I see across America today in the churches

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.720
that I preach in?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:38:00.600
Is that too many people, too many of God's people desire to be cleaner but not clean.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.279
You just let that settle in just for a moment because there's a difference between being

00:38:05.279 --> 00:38:11.480
clean and just being cleaner than what we were.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.840
And it's going all the way.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.840
I want to be clean.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.460
I want to be pure.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:22.000
Because every man that hath this hope, listen, Jesus is coming again.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.640
I don't know the hour and neither do you, but we better be ready.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.360
And every man that hath this hope, what does he do?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.000
He purifies himself even as he is pure.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.799
Father, we love you.

00:38:35.799 --> 00:38:36.880
We thank you for loving us.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.280
We thank you for the Word of God.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.160
We thank you for the promise of your return and we thank you for the certainty of your

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160
return.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.320
I read these words and I see the confidence of John and as I'm reminded of what John heard

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.239
firsthand, it helps us to understand why he had such confidence and as we now have the

00:38:55.239 --> 00:39:00.179
complete canon of Scripture, I pray that you'd help each of us to have that same measure

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:06.540
of confidence in the certain return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:13.660
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be impacted by this truth.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:24.859
If there's any measure of hesitation this morning on whether someone in our midst is

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:32.140
ready for the return of Christ, Lord, I pray that you'd help us to deal with that.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.619
Help us to live a life that is clean.

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:40.820
I understand that we will not be perfect, but we're not going to be comfortable, we're

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.660
not going to get used to sin.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:50.140
We're going to deal with it knowing that you promised to forgive us and to cleanse us.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.500
God, I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.260
Perhaps there's one in our midst that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.860
that the Lord Jesus Christ is their personal Savior, they're not ready for the return because

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.860
they're not saved.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.820
They can't say that they're a son of God because they've never been saved.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.100
There's one that's in that situation this morning.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.260
I pray that before it's eternally too late that they would place their faith and trust

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.180
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.080
They'd come to this old-fashioned altar that we'd take a Bible and show them how they could

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.940
know for sure that heaven is their home.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:33.920
Not hoping so, not thinking so, but having that assurance, that certainty that I belong

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:42.600
to Jesus, I've been washed in the blood of the crucified one, I am redeemed.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:51.240
For every child of God, I pray this truth would motivate us to godly living, would motivate

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.780
us to obedient living.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:01.780
Even as those children sang that song this morning, how fitting, how appropriate.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.960
God, You orchestrated that.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960
For that, I'm thankful.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.180
I pray that You'd move and work during this time of invitation as only You can.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.780
We'll thank You for it.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.980
In Christ's name we pray.
