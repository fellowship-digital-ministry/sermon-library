1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Well, we'll be looking at verses one down through verse number 30.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,119
And I sent a typo to Holly and told her it was through verse number 14.

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,279
And so if you're looking at the bulletin, there is a typo there.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,119
And that is my fault.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,239
We're going to look down through verse number 30 this evening.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,520
And so if you have your Bibles there, Genesis chapter number 29.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,360
Of course, we mentioned last week as we finished up Genesis chapter number 28, and we had the

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,399
opportunity to see a real change in the life of Jacob.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,759
And we had mentioned that for so many years as we've studied the scriptures and you look

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,919
at his life and you study through the events, you find that there's really nothing in the

11
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,439
life of Jacob that he is concerned for other than himself.

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,560
And you find that he was concerned on how he could get the birthright, he was concerned

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,119
on how he could receive the blessing, and he's concerned about himself.

14
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:56,200
And we find that as he was given instruction to depart, to leave, and Isaac had given him

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,439
that charge and had blessed him at the start of Genesis chapter number 28.

16
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,400
We find that God appeared to Jacob at the end of chapter number 28.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,959
And when he appeared to Jacob, we find that God gave him some very personal promises,

18
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,360
some very encouraging promises.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,279
And we find that Jacob is changed.

20
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:22,239
When you leave the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis, you begin to see how that Jacob

21
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,879
is making some declarations, that Jacob is understanding some things about the Lord God

22
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,199
Jehovah.

23
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:36,599
No longer is God just the God of Abraham and Isaac, but he declares in verse number 21,

24
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,559
then, shall the Lord be my God.

25
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:45,919
And we spoke about the significance of that personal relationship and understanding that

26
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:50,400
it's not just the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, but He's my God.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,419
And we find that he's vowing a vow.

28
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,959
He makes a declaration.

29
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,400
He sets up the pillar, pours oil upon it there at Bethel.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,760
He calls it the house of God.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,800
He made a declaration that he understood that it was from the good hand of God that God

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,740
blessed him and God gave to him, and he committed to giving a tithe unto the Lord.

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,440
And we find that Jacob's life, really, there's a change, an obvious change in his perspective

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,000
as you end the 28th chapter.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,979
It's interesting because as you enter into the 29th chapter, the Bible just simply begins

36
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,199
by saying, then Jacob went on his journey.

37
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,199
His journey continues.

38
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,320
And I want you to think this evening as we go through this passage of scripture and seek

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,360
to understand the historical context of what we're going to study and look at this evening,

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,080
I want you to think about our own walk with God, our journey, if you will, and how our

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,440
journey continues.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,759
There's a time in which, as we'd use the New Testament vernacular, that we trust that

43
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,380
the Lord Jesus Christ is our personal Savior, that we were saved, and then we get to walk

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,539
with Him.

45
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:04,720
And we've been singing this year this theme song, I walk with the King, hallelujah.

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,679
Isn't it wonderful to be able to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, to walk and to talk

47
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,320
with the King of kings and Lord of lords?

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,039
It's an absolute blessing, a unique privilege that we have.

49
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,559
And we find that Jacob, his journey is going to continue.

50
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:28,919
We find that Jacob, as you would study the remainder chapters of the book of Genesis,

51
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,440
really all the way through chapter number 49, you'll see tidbits throughout those chapters

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,639
with regard to the life of Jacob.

53
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,000
Some contain more information, such as the next couple, few chapters contain a whole

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,279
lot of information about the life of Jacob, and you'll get into some of those passages

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,440
as we enter into the section dealing with Joseph, where the primary focus is no longer

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,839
on Jacob, and it's on Joseph.

57
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:59,199
And Jacob, of course, still referenced in the 49th chapter of the book of Genesis.

58
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,259
You read his earthly journey with the Lord ends.

59
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,559
He dies.

60
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:09,160
And there's going to be some point in our life when our earthly journey with the Lord

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
ends.

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,239
Now, what blessing we have is that we understand the truth of being with Him for all of eternity.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,000
And we understand that we shall see Him, and that the truth that Paul reveals to us to

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,839
be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, and what great truth, encouraging

65
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,600
truth that is.

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,119
For Jacob, as we think about his journey and as we study this 29th chapter, the first 30

67
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:42,720
verses of it this evening, I want you to understand that his life unfolds, and there's some similarities

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440
that we can see even in our life.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
It's interesting.

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,200
There's some major life decisions that are made in Genesis chapter number 29, but yet

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,920
there's no reference whatsoever of Jacob praying.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Just not there.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
There's nothing.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,079
And there's a walk that we have.

75
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,540
Our journey continues with the Lord.

76
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,559
And as we have the whole canon of Scripture, and as we seek to learn what it is to walk

77
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:11,399
with the Lord Jesus Christ and how we are to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, we begin

78
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,480
to incorporate the truth of God's Word into our lives so that we might have a walk that

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,839
is pleasing in His sight.

80
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,640
And as we notice here in Genesis chapter number 29, the Bible says, then Jacob went on this

81
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,040
journey and came into the land of the people of the east.

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,679
And notice, if you will, we'll use this for our title this evening, in verse number 10,

83
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:36,440
it says, and it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,440
brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the

85
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,440
stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban and his mother's brother.

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,600
I've titled the message this evening from verse number 10, Jacob saw Rachel.

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,079
Of course, it's in this chapter that we read of the marriages, if you will, of Jacob, and

88
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,559
we'll study some things here.

89
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:03,640
If you are taking notes, notice with me, first of all, Jacob's arrival in Haran.

90
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,160
We understand that Jacob had left Bethel.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
Remember he had left, according to chapter number 28 in verse number 1 and 2, that Isaac

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,839
tells him to go to Paddan Aram and to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and

93
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,000
take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother, according

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,519
to Genesis 28 in verse number 2.

95
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,720
We find that the Bible recorded for us that stop that he had at Beersheba.

96
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
It says, excuse me, he went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran in verse number 10,

97
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:37,480
and then the stop that he had in Bethel, as it was called according to verse number 19.

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,959
Of course, prior to that, the place was called Luz.

99
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,000
And we find that Jacob is now continuing on his journey.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,359
He's continuing to go in the direction in which he had been instructed.

101
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:53,660
We find that this would reveal to us the obedience of Jacob to going to the place where he had

102
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,359
been instructed to go.

103
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:01,079
We find, as I mentioned last week, that Haran is the chief city of Paddan Aram, and that's

104
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,959
where we see the reference of Haran throughout these pages of Scripture.

105
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,959
But as we think about his arrival into the city of Haran, the Bible says that he came,

106
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,079
in verse number 1, into the land of the people of the east.

107
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,399
And notice the Bible tells us of his interactions as he arrives into the city, as he arrives

108
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,399
into Haran.

109
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,000
And the first interaction that is recorded for us, down through really verse number 12,

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,279
is his, excuse me, through verse number 8, are his interactions with these shepherds.

111
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,000
He arrives at the place, and the Bible says that he looked, in verse number 2, and behold

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,959
a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it.

113
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,239
For out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

114
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,040
It says in verse number 3, and thither were all the flocks gathered, and they rolled the

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,200
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's

116
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
mouth in its place.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,359
And so God's giving us some information with regard to the behavior of these shepherds,

118
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,440
to the mode by which they operate.

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,480
And we find, the Bible tells us, and they will give some information with regard to

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,160
this in verse number 8 as well, but these shepherds, they would all gather their flocks

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,760
together, and at a set time they would water all of the flocks once they arrived.

122
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,480
And we find that it tells us that they would roll that stone from the well's mouth, according

123
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,559
to verse number 3, they would water the sheep, and then they would return the stone again

124
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,920
to its place.

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,880
And so Jacob arrives, he's understanding some things, he sees these shepherds that

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,359
are there, and he begins to have an interaction with them.

127
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:35,559
Notice in verse number 4 that he says unto them, my brethren, whence be ye?

128
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,000
And they said, of Haran are we?

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
And there's not much interaction, not much discussion.

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,159
They give a simple answer to the question that was asked by Jacob, and he then pries

131
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:53,520
and probes, if you will, and he says to them, know ye Laban, the son of Nahor?

132
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
And they said, we know him.

133
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,559
Again, the conversation's not going real fast, real deep, right?

134
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,960
It's just kind of a, you asked a question, I gave you an answer.

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,919
And Jacob is interacting with these shepherds, and perhaps these shepherds, maybe by the

136
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,380
tone is what we're seeing here, maybe they were a little bit concerned as to who this

137
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,080
new guy is that's coming to town, what's going on, why is he asking questions, so on and

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
so forth.

139
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,760
And we find that Jacob then says in verse number 6, it says, and he said unto them,

140
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,640
is he well?

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,599
And they said, he is well.

142
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,159
And behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

143
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:41,239
And he said, now Jacob is responding, he says, lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time

144
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:47,799
that the cattle should be gathered together, water ye the sheep and go and feed them.

145
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,960
It's kind of interesting because he has this interaction in verse number 7, really you

146
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,119
don't see that there's any level of Jacob being shy whatsoever, he's going to give them

147
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,119
some instruction.

148
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,039
He says that it's high day.

149
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,679
day. It's not a time that the cattle, and that's a generic term, by the way. We would use the term

150
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:12,039
cattle to speak of cows, but this is a generic term to speak of livestock. And we see that,

151
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,719
speaking of the sheep in particular, and he says that they are to water the sheep and then go and

152
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:23,319
feed them. And notice what they say in verse number eight. We cannot, until all the flocks

153
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:29,479
be gathered together, until they roll the stone from the well's mouth, then we water the sheep.

154
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:35,399
And so they would wait, instead of opening the well and watering, they'd wait for all of the

155
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,679
flocks to gather, and they would then water the sheep, and then they would return the stone

156
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,399
according to what the operation or process was given to us in verse number three. Notice it says

157
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,839
in that while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them. And

158
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,239
it came to pass in verse number 10, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's

159
00:10:55,239 --> 00:11:00,439
brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone

160
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:05,879
from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. And so now we see

161
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,839
the interaction, yes, with the shepherds, but now I want you to see the interaction with Rachel.

162
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,599
The Bible tells us, and he now has watered the flocks. It says that Jacob went near at the end

163
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:21,079
of verse number 10. He rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban,

164
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,639
his mother's brother. Now, he's brand new into the city, and he's interacted with these shepherds.

165
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,199
He's asked some questions. Why aren't you watering them? It's not a time for them to be gathered.

166
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:38,999
They're to be watered and then go feed them. And he's inquired about his family, and we find that

167
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:44,999
now Rachel comes. He, Jacob, takes it upon himself to remove that stone so that the flock could be

168
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:51,399
watered. And he waters the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel

169
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,439
and lifted up his voice and wept, according to verse number 11. I believe that there was great

170
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:02,199
joy. There was a measure of rejoicing in verse number 11. Remember, he had been sent out in

171
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:07,559
chapter number 28. He had been sent out from his house. He had been given direction as to

172
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:13,399
where to go and what to do. And now that he's arrived to the place where he's supposed to be,

173
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,399
now as he has been given that instruction to go to Bethuel or to the house of Bethuel,

174
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,479
thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban,

175
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:29,879
thy mother's brother. And now I believe that Jacob is rejoicing. He kisses Rachel. He lifts

176
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,279
up his voice and wept. By the way, this isn't the way that someone would kiss someone here in

177
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,959
America. You have to understand the cultural aspects and what have you. And it's not just

178
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,359
that Jacob just, man, look, she's beautiful and kisses her, right? And it's not the way it works.

179
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:50,759
You've got to understand the cultural aspects and those greetings and what have you. In fact,

180
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:57,559
Laban and Jacob have a similar type of an embrace. And it says that Jacob told Rachel that he was

181
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,559
her father's brother in verse number 12, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her

182
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:11,959
father. Now we find that it's now this interaction with Rachel is now giving her some insight as to

183
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:19,879
who this man is, this guy that just showed up. She comes to the well to water the flock, and

184
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,799
there's this new guy there. And he takes it upon himself to move the stone and to water the flock.

185
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:31,799
And the Bible tells us that now she has insight as to who this guy is. It's Jacob, and she ran and

186
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,919
told her father at the end of verse number 12. And verse 13 tells us that it came to pass when Laban

187
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:43,239
heard the tidings of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him

188
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:49,399
and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. In the first 12 verses of Genesis

189
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:58,039
chapter number 29, we see some interactions that Jacob has. His arrival to Haran, and we see these

190
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,079
interactions, the one at the well with the shepherds, the one at the well with Rachel.

191
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,719
And let me just say this. As we go on our journey with the Lord, we're going to have some interactions

192
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:15,319
with people. We're going to meet some people along the way. We're going to meet a variety of people.

193
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:21,719
We're going to have interactions with people, and we must be mindful of that. We also must be mindful

194
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:26,919
of the fact, and we don't see it here, and I'm just making some application as we think about

195
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:33,319
the parallels of Jacob's journey and our journey with the Lord and being the representatives that

196
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:40,119
we are, that in those interactions, that God has a purpose for those interactions. God has a plan

197
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:46,119
for those interactions, and we need to be careful, even as we mentioned in Sunday school this morning,

198
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:52,679
that we'd understand that God's purpose in those interactions is for us to be used of Him.

199
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,599
And what a joy it is that God would enable us, that He would involve us in His work.

200
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:05,879
We find that here, there's no doubt this introductory introduction and

201
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,039
greetings with these shepherds. Of course, there would be many years in which Jacob would be in

202
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,399
this region, and there'd be many more encounters with shepherds and what have you. But of course,

203
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,199
you think about the significance of this interaction with Rachel and how that those

204
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:28,759
things proceed, and we see the interactions lead to an invitation. The invitation is given,

205
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,479
it's not necessarily in verse number 13 where it's an actual invite that is given, but you notice

206
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:40,759
near the end of the verse that it says, "...and brought him to his house." And I see the hospitality

207
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:48,919
of Laban. We see also, no doubt, the relief of Jacob. Again, Jacob went out. He went out

208
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:57,159
really from his presence of his family, knowing that his brother desired to kill him, right?

209
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:02,839
Esau was ready to kill him. And you think about the departure there at the beginning of Genesis

210
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,119
chapter number 28, and I believe it was a great relief when he comes here and he interacts and

211
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:14,119
he meets Laban, and Laban then brings him to his house. And what a relief that would be. According

212
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:19,319
to verse number 14, the Bible tells us that he was there for one month. And Laban said to him,

213
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:26,359
"'Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month."

214
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:35,799
Remember when the truth was given in Genesis chapter number 27 about Rebekah telling him to

215
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:41,879
leave? Do you remember how long Rebekah said? A few days, right? You remember that? We know,

216
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,079
and we noted in that passage at the end of Genesis chapter 27, that those days turned into years.

217
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:53,479
But even in this initial stage of this initial departure, we find that he's there for a month.

218
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:58,679
And after that month, there's now some discussion that takes place between Laban and Jacob,

219
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,719
and it leads us to our second point this evening. Not only Jacob's arrival in Haran, but I want you

220
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:08,759
to notice Jacob's agreement with Laban. There's an agreement that is made, and we see how this

221
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,959
agreement, the details are provided to us in verses 15 through 20. Notice in verse 15,

222
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,199
Laban said unto Jacob, "'Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for

223
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:27,559
not? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?' And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah,

224
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,439
and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and

225
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:37,399
well-favored. And Jacob loved Rachel and said, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel,

226
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:42,279
thy younger daughter.' And Laban said, "'It is better that I give her to thee,

227
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,359
than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.' And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,

228
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:55,079
and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her." As we note the details of

229
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,359
this agreement, we find that the question is asked by Laban in verse number 15, "'What shall

230
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:08,999
thy wages be?' And we find that in verses 16 and 17 that the truth is given to us with regard to the

231
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:16,119
two daughters of Laban, Leah and Rachel, and no doubt it would be in the best interest of Laban

232
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:22,199
to have his daughters married and understanding, again, some of the cultural aspects of those

233
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:31,319
things. And we find that the question that is asked is answered by Jacob in verse number 18,

234
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:38,199
where he says, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.'" And we find that

235
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it tells us that Jacob loved Rachel in verse number 18, and he's been given this truth to

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,679
Laban that, "'I will serve you for seven years.'" That's a long time. And he makes this commitment,

237
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,079
and we find that the details of the agreement, according to verse number 19, the terms of the

238
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,239
agreement are settled. I believe that they're agreed to, but we, of course, understand some

239
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:08,919
of what takes place in this passage of Scripture. Notice what Laban says in verse number 19. He says,

240
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,959
"'It is better that I give her to thee.'" Who's he speaking of when he says her? Rachel, right?

241
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:22,440
That was the question that was asked. Remember, when Laban said, "'What will your wages be?'

242
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:31,079
Jacob said, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.'" And the Bible tells

243
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:39,479
us that Laban said, "'It is better that I give her to thee.'" He's speaking about Rachel to Jacob,

244
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:44,759
right? The follow? I know I'm kind of belaboring the point, but I am on purpose.

245
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,919
And the terms of the agreement are known and they're agreed to, and notice what Laban says.

246
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,959
He says, "'It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man.

247
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,959
Abide with me.'" So when he says, "'Abide with me,' that's

248
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:04,279
That's agreeing to the details that have already been provided.

249
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,039
Now let me ask you this question.

250
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,719
Did Laban know about the custom in their country that he refers to in verse number 26?

251
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,719
Did he know?

252
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,039
Laban knew about it, right?

253
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,559
Jacob didn't know about this custom, but Laban was aware of the custom.

254
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,759
Laban knows.

255
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,599
He says in verse number 26, it must not be so done in our country to give the younger

256
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,799
before the firstborn.

257
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,279
Did he know that in verse number 19 or was that just revealed to him afterwards?

258
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,839
He knew that.

259
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,559
He was well aware of what the custom and the culture where he lived and where he had raised

260
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,559
his family.

261
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,319
He was well aware of it.

262
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:47,919
But we find that as he's interacting with Jacob, he tells Jacob, it's better that I

263
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,559
give her to thee.

264
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,399
Abide with me.

265
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,759
And so Jacob served seven years for Rachel.

266
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,119
Again, that's a lengthy period of time.

267
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,479
And the Bible tells us, what a thought.

268
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:05,319
It says in verse number 20, and they, those seven years, they seemed unto him but a few

269
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,319
days.

270
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,319
Why?

271
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,439
For the love he had to her.

272
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,679
That's pretty good.

273
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,679
Amen?

274
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,439
All you guys that aren't romantic, you try to get something out of there, amen?

275
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,879
And figure it out.

276
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,079
But the reality is that he had such love.

277
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,359
It tells us in verse number 18 that Jacob loved Rachel.

278
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:31,239
And I believe that as Jacob is desiring to marry Rachel, as we see here in this passage

279
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:36,839
of Scripture, those seven years passed and it seemed like just some days to him.

280
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,839
Why?

281
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,159
Because it wasn't so much that he was just toiling in work.

282
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,739
It wasn't the monotony of the day.

283
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:46,119
It wasn't the task at hand.

284
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,399
It was the prize that was before him.

285
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,999
Does that make sense?

286
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:50,999
Right?

287
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:55,399
He's thinking, I got to get this work done and then I'm going to have a bride.

288
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,959
Kind of motivates you, right?

289
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:02,399
And Jacob is in this place of being motivated and he's working.

290
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:08,919
And as we will study, as we continue through the book of Genesis, we'll find that as the,

291
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,999
at the end of chapter number 30, the latter part, and of course, as you continue into

292
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:18,919
chapter number 31, you'll find that God blessed Laban for Jacob's sake.

293
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,339
And you'll read some of those things and no doubt Jacob was a hard worker.

294
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,339
How do we see that?

295
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,279
Well, as soon as he gets to the, to the well, what does he do?

296
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,279
He's like, why are you guys standing around?

297
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,999
It's not a time for the cattle to be gathered.

298
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,359
Like come on, let's, let's do what we're supposed to do, right?

299
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,019
That was his interaction with the shepherds, right?

300
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,599
And so no doubt Jacob was a hard worker.

301
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,159
He was diligent.

302
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,439
And I think that Laban found himself in a position where he is recognizing he's going

303
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:53,799
to have some free labor and he's also going to have a husband for his daughter.

304
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:59,479
Of course, all the while, he has Leah in mind, he has Leah in mind.

305
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:02,839
That is, Laban has Leah in mind.

306
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,239
And that's what we see in Jacob's agreement with Laban.

307
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:10,039
We see the details in verses 15 through 20, but I want you to see the deception in verses

308
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,959
21 through 30.

309
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:17,719
The Bible tells us in verse number 21 that Jacob said unto Laban, give me my wife for

310
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:21,199
my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her.

311
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:25,219
And so we see that Jacob had fulfilled his end of the agreement.

312
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,479
He had served for seven years for Rachel.

313
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:31,779
We see that in verse 20, we see in verse 21 that he comes to Laban.

314
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,519
If I could use this terminology, it's payday.

315
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,559
I've fulfilled my responsibility and now it's time for me.

316
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,179
The agreement that we made is that I'm going to serve you for Rachel, and you said that

317
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,959
you would, it was better for you to give her to me than to another man, and so I'm ready

318
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,959
for my wife.

319
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:53,119
And we find that Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast in verse

320
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,119
number 22.

321
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,599
Again, this would be customary for this time and this culture.

322
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,519
And you find that he's preparing for this wedding and all that's taking place.

323
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,959
All the while, Laban knows what he's doing.

324
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,719
Jacob has no idea what's going on.

325
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:13,279
I think Jacob has every thought that he's going to be marrying Rachel, the agreement

326
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,999
that was made.

327
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:20,279
And here we find that Laban's gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast

328
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:26,839
and it came to pass in the evening, look in verse 23, that he took Leah, his daughter,

329
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,879
and brought her to him.

330
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:35,599
And he went in unto her and Laban gave unto his daughter, Leah, his maid for a handmaid.

331
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:39,679
And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah.

332
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,839
And he, Jacob, said to Laban, what is this thou hast done unto me?

333
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,559
Did not I serve with thee for Rachel?

334
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:56,559
Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

335
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,039
That's an interesting situation.

336
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,239
I'm just going to leave it at that.

337
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:09,519
But I'm going to notice in verse number 26, I want you to think about this this evening

338
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,079
and I hope it's helpful for us.

339
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:17,559
I've meditated upon this and I think that there's something really important for us

340
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,559
to glean.

341
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:26,639
It says that Laban said, it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before

342
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,839
the firstborn.

343
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,739
Isn't it interesting the verbiage that Laban uses?

344
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:39,279
Why is it that the verbiage that Laban uses is of such interest to us?

345
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:48,359
Well, because in Jacob's own experience, there was a situation with the younger and the firstborn.

346
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,159
And I think about the custom that is explained in verse number 26, and I think about the

347
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,839
use of that word firstborn, and I think about Jacob hearing those words when Jacob, listen,

348
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,279
I think Jacob's probably not a very happy individual in verse number 25, okay?

349
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,719
Would you agree?

350
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:12,439
When he goes to Laban and he says to Laban, what is this that thou hast done unto me?

351
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:16,039
I think there's some emotion behind that, all right?

352
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,359
I think that he's probably pretty upset about what's transpired.

353
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,599
He's very confused as to what's transpired.

354
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,239
I think there's a measure of emotion.

355
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,419
He's irritated.

356
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,959
He says, did not I serve with thee for Rachel?

357
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:33,239
Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

358
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:37,999
And Laban begins to explain, and he provides this explanation that it must not be so done

359
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:42,559
in our country to give the younger before the firstborn.

360
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,679
And I just wonder, when Jacob heard that word firstborn, I wonder if it had an impact in

361
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,839
his life.

362
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,679
I wonder if perhaps he had been mindful.

363
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,799
You'll remember as we've studied here through Genesis chapter 29 at this point, there's

364
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,719
no reference whatsoever of Jacob explaining to Laban or to Rachel why he was there in

365
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,519
the first place.

366
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,519
There's no explanation whatsoever.

367
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,119
And we know all that has transpired in the life of Jacob, and we come to this place and

368
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:20,559
we see that Jacob is in this situation and he hears these words and he hears about the

369
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
custom.

370
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,519
Now why am I making this focus and this emphasis here?

371
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,319
Well, I believe that as we journey with the Lord, that God seeks to teach us things, that

372
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,519
God seeks to deal with us and to help us in our journey with Him.

373
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:47,999
Some have given the idea of Genesis 29 that this is a great example of sowing and reaping

374
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:53,019
and so on and so forth, and you understand how Jacob deceived and he was a deceiver and

375
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:57,439
all that he did with the birthright and the blessing and what you do, what you sow, you're

376
00:27:57,439 --> 00:28:01,239
going to reap and so on and so forth, and certainly there's a measure of that in this

377
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:04,399
passage of Scripture.

378
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,919
But I also believe that as you look at Jacob in this passage of Scripture and you consider

379
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,679
all that has transpired and you understand especially the end of chapter number 28 and

380
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,779
the change in Jacob's life, that yes, there is a measure of the sowing and reaping principle

381
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:29,039
in view here, but I also believe that it's a situation where God is teaching Jacob some

382
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,479
important life principles.

383
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:37,319
I believe that Jacob is being taught by God the importance of seeking the face of God.

384
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,079
I believe that he's learning some things.

385
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,679
See, Jacob is in this position where he's, again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

386
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,479
there's no reference in Genesis chapter 29 of Jacob praying about any of these decisions,

387
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,599
about Jacob praying about any of these agreements.

388
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:00,039
And no doubt as we journey in our life with the Lord, there are times and perhaps as we

389
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,199
started our journey that maybe we didn't pray about things the way that we pray about things

390
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,199
now.

391
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:08,199
Maybe there are seasons in our life where we don't pray about things as often as we

392
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:14,679
do at other times, and so God is teaching Jacob some truth here, and Jacob, no doubt,

393
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,559
I believe that this is one of the things that God would use in the life of Jacob to really

394
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,079
humble him.

395
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,119
I think about the brothers of Joseph.

396
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,399
Do you remember when the brothers of Joseph will get to it in, I don't know how many months,

397
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,279
but we'll get to it eventually.

398
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,599
But we think about the interaction with Joseph and his brothers, and you think about the

399
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,839
guilt and the conviction that they have as they stand before Joseph, and Joseph doesn't

400
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,039
reveal himself to them quite yet, and he's going through the process, and we find that

401
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,519
the visit is there, and all that takes place, and you'll remember the passage of Scripture,

402
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,959
the second visit, and all that's taking place, and of course as we go through and you find

403
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,679
reveals himself, but you know,

404
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,559
before he ever revealed himself,

405
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,879
there was a measure of brokenness in the lives

406
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:09,319
and the hearts of the people, his brothers,

407
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,839
and we believe, as you study throughout

408
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,999
the portions of scripture, and you see what's taking place,

409
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:18,739
that their heart was breaking for Benjamin, remember?

410
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:21,879
How is it, how are we gonna go back to dad?

411
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:24,959
I mean, this is going to absolutely destroy him.

412
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,499
He's gonna go down to the grave.

413
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:29,419
They're concerned, the brothers of Joseph are concerned,

414
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:31,539
and listen, did they have any concern

415
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,939
on how they were gonna go to dad

416
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:37,019
with the coat of many colors that was dipped in blood?

417
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,379
They didn't have any concern whatsoever, did they?

418
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,699
They get that coat of many colors,

419
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,679
and they come to dad, and what do they say?

420
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,499
Do you know whose this is, right?

421
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:48,339
And then what they do?

422
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:53,019
And the reality is that they had no remorse whatsoever.

423
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,579
They knew exactly where Joseph was,

424
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,659
what they had done, what had transpired,

425
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:02,499
and they didn't care how it would impact their father.

426
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,379
But the reality is that years later,

427
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,059
through some circumstances, God works and God breaks them.

428
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,699
I believe that God is using this in the life of Jacob

429
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:17,439
to break him, to bring him to a greater level of humility.

430
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,999
We don't see all of it in the next couple of chapters.

431
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,059
There's a number of things that continue

432
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,419
in the life of Jacob that are challenges and difficulties

433
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,419
with this new walk with the Lord that he has

434
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,979
and all that's taking place.

435
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:33,619
And so we find that he's given an explanation

436
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,299
with regard to the custom,

437
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,619
and the Bible tells us in verse number 27,

438
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:38,939
notice what Laban says,

439
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,939
fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also

440
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:45,339
for the service which thou shalt serve

441
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,939
with me yet seven other years.

442
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:52,059
So here's what Laban is saying in verse number 27,

443
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:55,139
the week of festivities for the marriage to Leah

444
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,139
were to be fulfilled.

445
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:57,939
That's what he refers to in verse 27,

446
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,699
when he says fulfill her week,

447
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,859
he's referring to those seven days,

448
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,339
that week of festivities with regard to the marriage,

449
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,019
fulfill that for Leah,

450
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:10,659
and we will give thee this also for the service,

451
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,499
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

452
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,779
So seven more years, and you can have Rachel.

453
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:20,459
As your wife.

454
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,179
Now notice it says this in verse 28,

455
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:25,419
and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week,

456
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,339
and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also,

457
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:31,619
and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid

458
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,099
to be her maid,

459
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,779
and it says that he went in also unto Rachel,

460
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:36,459
and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,

461
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:38,779
and served with him yet seven other years.

462
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,499
And so Jacob really, as you look at the passage

463
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:43,539
and see the way that it unfolds,

464
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,419
he marries Rachel,

465
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,499
he confronts Laban about the deception,

466
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,139
and we find that Laban says, all right, fulfill her week,

467
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:52,779
and I'll give you Rachel,

468
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,259
but you gotta serve seven more years,

469
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:55,339
he fulfills the week,

470
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,939
he then is married to Rachel,

471
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,939
and then he is going to serve for seven more years

472
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,259
according to verse number 30 for Rachel.

473
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,579
And so think about Laban,

474
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,299
and think about what's taking place here,

475
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,859
Laban really sees the opportunity

476
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:14,859
to get 14 years of basically free labor, right?

477
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:17,139
And his older daughter,

478
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,579
the Bible tells us that she was tender-eyed

479
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,059
in verse number 17 and Rachel was beautiful,

480
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:24,299
he now has a means, a way

481
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,579
in which he gets to get both of his daughters married,

482
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:32,499
which again would be a desire of a dad of daughters.

483
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:35,899
Remember, think about this truth,

484
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:39,019
who was it that brought the sheep to the well?

485
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,339
It was Rachel, right?

486
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,899
So no doubt Laban was a place

487
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,139
where he wanted to have his daughters married,

488
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,179
he needed some free labor,

489
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,419
and so this deception takes place.

490
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,899
And we think about this deception

491
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,499
and we think about this situation

492
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,859
and we can offer all sorts of opinions,

493
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:59,859
and again, there's definitely an aspect

494
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,579
of sowing and reaping that's here,

495
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:04,899
there's an aspect in which God is molding and shaping

496
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,219
and through the interactions that we deal with in life

497
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,939
and through the experiences that we have

498
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,499
as we journey with the Lord,

499
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:13,699
as we walk with the Lord, God's growing us.

500
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,139
And sometimes he grows us through situations

501
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,499
that are less than desirable.

502
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:21,899
I don't like being deceived, do you?

503
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:26,699
I've never been deceived at this level, amen?

504
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,779
Mark laughed, I don't think any of you

505
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,979
have been deceived at this level, amen?

506
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:34,099
But the reality is that none of us like to be deceived.

507
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,499
But as we seek to journey with the Lord,

508
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:39,019
we're going to have experiences

509
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,119
where they're less than desirable experiences.

510
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,599
And how do we respond to those situations?

511
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,119
What do we do in those circumstances?

512
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,759
How is it that as we look at the life of Jacob

513
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,199
and we can see the historical context,

514
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,959
we see what happens, we understand,

515
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,839
we can follow the journey of Jacob

516
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,999
and we'll see as we get into our next message,

517
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,519
really probably a couple of messages

518
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,759
of all of his children and the sons

519
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:04,959
and you see all that takes place.

520
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,759
But I really want us to think about

521
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:09,239
as we could use a parallel in closing this evening

522
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,599
of really our journey with the Lord.

523
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,979
Listen, our journey with the Lord isn't always easy.

524
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,799
Have you found that to be so?

525
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:21,719
There's difficulties that we face.

526
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,639
There are challenges along the way.

527
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,159
As New Testament believers, I'm so thankful,

528
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,799
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

529
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,599
that we have the whole canon of Scripture

530
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,439
and we have truth that we can run to

531
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,119
and we can seek the face of God

532
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,679
and we can know the will of God

533
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,559
and we can understand what God's plan is

534
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,399
and we can follow it.

535
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:41,399
But there's still some difficulties that we deal with

536
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:44,399
and how we must trust him and how we must follow him

537
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,079
and though we might be wronged

538
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,459
and though we might be deceived

539
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,279
and though we might have adversity,

540
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,879
that we keep our eyes on the Lord

541
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,959
and we keep pushing forward,

542
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,879
pressing forward, onward.

543
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,599
As we look throughout the Word of God,

544
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,799
there's really not a Bible character

545
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:04,439
that we would refer to as being

546
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:06,459
some type of a hero of the faith,

547
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:11,139
someone that their life is worth studying and emulating,

548
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,179
but that did not have problems.

549
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:17,899
And this evening, as we think about our journey,

550
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:20,179
listen, there are some that paint the idea

551
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,219
of a Christian life being a bed of roses

552
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,659
and just trust Jesus

553
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,779
and all your problems are gonna go away.

554
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,379
No, no, you trust Jesus

555
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:33,659
and he's with you through all of your problems.

556
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,619
Isn't that precious?

557
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,739
I understand that man desires

558
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,899
for all of his troubles to go away.

559
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:44,699
But we live in a sin-cursed world, right?

560
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:47,819
Jacob, the very first experience

561
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:51,459
after he leaves the place

562
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,339
where he met the Lord there in Bethel

563
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,499
and after he'd made the vows and the commitments

564
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,419
and after he gets to Haran

565
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,459
and he meets Rachel and he meets Laban

566
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:01,419
and all that takes place,

567
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,299
seven years, he's deceived

568
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,639
and it's a great level of deception.

569
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:13,679
They're trials and difficulties that we face in life.

570
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:18,939
Someone that said that the trust Christ

571
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:22,139
and they've explained and tried to paint the picture

572
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,019
that the Christian life is like a bed of roses,

573
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,359
the reality is that knowing, think about this truth.

574
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:33,259
All men have problems.

575
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:36,819
All mankind has problems, right?

576
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:42,099
Have you ever thought in your life this thought,

577
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,959
I don't know how they do it without Christ?

578
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:48,799
You've had that thought, have you not?

579
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,219
You see people that suffer, you see people that struggle,

580
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,939
you see people that deal with adversity,

581
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,299
but so do we, but we have Christ.

582
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,139
We have the Lord with us and he sustains us

583
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:05,299
and he helps us and he guides us

584
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,259
and he has purposes and he's growing us

585
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:08,979
and he's molding us and listen,

586
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:12,659
sometimes the molding process isn't very comfortable.

587
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,139
Sometimes he uses some things

588
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:19,459
like using that phrase firstborn

589
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,019
where it's a flood of memories that must come back

590
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:24,439
in the heart of Jacob and the mind of Jacob

591
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:27,099
of all that he did to Esau

592
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,139
and how he deceived Esau

593
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,779
and all that took place and all that transpired

594
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,779
and no doubt there would be some recollection

595
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,779
of those things and God will use those types of things

596
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:42,299
in our lives to conform us to the image of his dear son

597
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:45,959
and I find that in the life of Jacob

598
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:49,259
as we chronicle his journeys, as we chronicle his life

599
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,939
and we trace his steps,

600
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:54,419
that there are definitely some parallels for us.

601
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:58,439
This evening, it is a joy to walk and talk with the king.

602
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:02,119
It is an absolute joy to know the Lord Jesus Christ

603
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,319
as our personal savior

604
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,399
but our problems don't go away overnight

605
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,839
but we have the Lord to help us through our problems.

606
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,759
Listen, it's interesting that even though Jacob

607
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:22,239
doesn't pray, in fact, it's a while before Jacob

608
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,279
really prays and seeks the face of God,

609
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,619
there's a lot of things that take place.

610
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,759
We're at 14 years right now.

611
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,799
The end of chapter number,

612
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,199
well, we're at seven years and a week

613
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,999
and then he's gonna serve for seven more years

614
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,039
and by the end of the chapter,

615
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,839
you're gonna be near 14 years

616
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,839
because he's going to say, I'm ready to depart.

617
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,119
So he's fulfilled that other seven years

618
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,159
by the end of the chapter

619
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,999
and still there's no record of Jacob praying at that point

620
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,679
but you know what's interesting?

621
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,439
God continued to bless Jacob.

622
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,719
Laban recognized the blessing that God had put in his life

623
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,199
because of Jacob.

624
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,559
God always fulfills His promises.

625
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,159
And God promised that He would be with Jacob and He would bless Jacob.

626
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,159
And He did.

627
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,019
And what a blessing that is.

628
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,799
This evening, we're all at a different place of our journey with the Lord.

629
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:19,279
But wherever you are, wherever I am in our journey with the Lord, I would say this, there

630
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:22,839
are a number of interactions that we're going to have with all kinds of people.

631
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,919
We're going to have various experiences, some that are less than desirable.

632
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:29,919
We're going to be hurt.

633
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,159
We're going to be deceived.

634
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:40,999
But through it, on our journey, God is molding us and shaping us and helping us to be who

635
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:43,119
we're supposed to be in Christ.

636
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,279
Remember that song, He's Still Working on Me?

637
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,879
See, He created all of the universe in just six days, right?

638
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:54,879
Powerful.

639
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:58,679
But see, He's still working on me, and He's still working on you.

640
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,839
And by the way, we ought to be thankful that He's working on us, amen?

641
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:10,719
And He's, in only the way that He can, as the potter with the clay, He's shaping us.

642
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,979
And sometimes there's some rough edges that have to be taken care of, and God has His

643
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,699
ways of taking care of those things.

644
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:23,939
And so as we journey with the Lord, help us to keep our eyes on the Lord.

645
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,459
Father, we love You.

646
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:26,699
We thank You for loving us.

647
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,699
Thank You for the day.

648
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:28,699
Thank You for the blessings.

649
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:35,819
As we think about the life of Jacob, we chronicle his life, we trace his steps, we see the events.

650
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:43,099
I hope tonight that we could take, by way of application, some of this parallel of our

651
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,739
own journey with You, that we'd learn some things not to do, and we'd learn some things

652
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,659
to do.

653
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:56,419
God, that You'd help us to seek Your face, that You'd help us to obey You.

654
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:59,259
Such a blessing to have the whole canon of Scripture.

655
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:08,299
And Lord, I pray that You'd be pleased with our lives, that we'd walk worthy as the believers

656
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:11,499
in Ephesus are challenged to do so.

657
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:15,459
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation as only You can, and

658
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:16,459
we'll thank You for it.

659
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:17,579
In Christ's name we pray.
