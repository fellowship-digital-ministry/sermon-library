WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
Well, we'll be looking at verses one down through verse number 30.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.119
And I sent a typo to Holly and told her it was through verse number 14.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.279
And so if you're looking at the bulletin, there is a typo there.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.119
And that is my fault.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.239
We're going to look down through verse number 30 this evening.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.520
And so if you have your Bibles there, Genesis chapter number 29.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.360
Of course, we mentioned last week as we finished up Genesis chapter number 28, and we had the

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.399
opportunity to see a real change in the life of Jacob.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.759
And we had mentioned that for so many years as we've studied the scriptures and you look

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:38.919
at his life and you study through the events, you find that there's really nothing in the

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:42.439
life of Jacob that he is concerned for other than himself.

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:46.560
And you find that he was concerned on how he could get the birthright, he was concerned

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.119
on how he could receive the blessing, and he's concerned about himself.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:56.200
And we find that as he was given instruction to depart, to leave, and Isaac had given him

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.439
that charge and had blessed him at the start of Genesis chapter number 28.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.400
We find that God appeared to Jacob at the end of chapter number 28.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.959
And when he appeared to Jacob, we find that God gave him some very personal promises,

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.360
some very encouraging promises.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.279
And we find that Jacob is changed.

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:22.239
When you leave the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis, you begin to see how that Jacob

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:27.879
is making some declarations, that Jacob is understanding some things about the Lord God

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.199
Jehovah.

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:36.599
No longer is God just the God of Abraham and Isaac, but he declares in verse number 21,

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.559
then, shall the Lord be my God.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:45.919
And we spoke about the significance of that personal relationship and understanding that

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:50.400
it's not just the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, but He's my God.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.419
And we find that he's vowing a vow.

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:53.959
He makes a declaration.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.400
He sets up the pillar, pours oil upon it there at Bethel.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.760
He calls it the house of God.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.800
He made a declaration that he understood that it was from the good hand of God that God

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.740
blessed him and God gave to him, and he committed to giving a tithe unto the Lord.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.440
And we find that Jacob's life, really, there's a change, an obvious change in his perspective

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.000
as you end the 28th chapter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.979
It's interesting because as you enter into the 29th chapter, the Bible just simply begins

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.199
by saying, then Jacob went on his journey.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.199
His journey continues.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:35.320
And I want you to think this evening as we go through this passage of scripture and seek

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.360
to understand the historical context of what we're going to study and look at this evening,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.080
I want you to think about our own walk with God, our journey, if you will, and how our

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.440
journey continues.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.759
There's a time in which, as we'd use the New Testament vernacular, that we trust that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:58.380
the Lord Jesus Christ is our personal Savior, that we were saved, and then we get to walk

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.539
with Him.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.720
And we've been singing this year this theme song, I walk with the King, hallelujah.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.679
Isn't it wonderful to be able to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, to walk and to talk

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.320
with the King of kings and Lord of lords?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.039
It's an absolute blessing, a unique privilege that we have.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.559
And we find that Jacob, his journey is going to continue.

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:28.919
We find that Jacob, as you would study the remainder chapters of the book of Genesis,

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.440
really all the way through chapter number 49, you'll see tidbits throughout those chapters

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.639
with regard to the life of Jacob.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.000
Some contain more information, such as the next couple, few chapters contain a whole

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.279
lot of information about the life of Jacob, and you'll get into some of those passages

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.440
as we enter into the section dealing with Joseph, where the primary focus is no longer

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.839
on Jacob, and it's on Joseph.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:59.199
And Jacob, of course, still referenced in the 49th chapter of the book of Genesis.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.259
You read his earthly journey with the Lord ends.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:05.559
He dies.

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:09.160
And there's going to be some point in our life when our earthly journey with the Lord

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
ends.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.239
Now, what blessing we have is that we understand the truth of being with Him for all of eternity.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
And we understand that we shall see Him, and that the truth that Paul reveals to us to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.839
be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, and what great truth, encouraging

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.600
truth that is.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.119
For Jacob, as we think about his journey and as we study this 29th chapter, the first 30

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:42.720
verses of it this evening, I want you to understand that his life unfolds, and there's some similarities

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.440
that we can see even in our life.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440
It's interesting.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.200
There's some major life decisions that are made in Genesis chapter number 29, but yet

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.920
there's no reference whatsoever of Jacob praying.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Just not there.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.160
There's nothing.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.079
And there's a walk that we have.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.540
Our journey continues with the Lord.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.559
And as we have the whole canon of Scripture, and as we seek to learn what it is to walk

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.399
with the Lord Jesus Christ and how we are to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ, we begin

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:17.480
to incorporate the truth of God's Word into our lives so that we might have a walk that

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.839
is pleasing in His sight.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.640
And as we notice here in Genesis chapter number 29, the Bible says, then Jacob went on this

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.040
journey and came into the land of the people of the east.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.679
And notice, if you will, we'll use this for our title this evening, in verse number 10,

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:36.440
it says, and it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.440
brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.440
stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban and his mother's brother.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.600
I've titled the message this evening from verse number 10, Jacob saw Rachel.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.079
Of course, it's in this chapter that we read of the marriages, if you will, of Jacob, and

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.559
we'll study some things here.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.640
If you are taking notes, notice with me, first of all, Jacob's arrival in Haran.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.160
We understand that Jacob had left Bethel.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.440
Remember he had left, according to chapter number 28 in verse number 1 and 2, that Isaac

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.839
tells him to go to Paddan Aram and to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.000
take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother, according

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.519
to Genesis 28 in verse number 2.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.720
We find that the Bible recorded for us that stop that he had at Beersheba.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.720
It says, excuse me, he went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran in verse number 10,

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:37.480
and then the stop that he had in Bethel, as it was called according to verse number 19.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.959
Of course, prior to that, the place was called Luz.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.000
And we find that Jacob is now continuing on his journey.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.359
He's continuing to go in the direction in which he had been instructed.

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:53.660
We find that this would reveal to us the obedience of Jacob to going to the place where he had

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.359
been instructed to go.

00:06:55.359 --> 00:07:01.079
We find, as I mentioned last week, that Haran is the chief city of Paddan Aram, and that's

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.959
where we see the reference of Haran throughout these pages of Scripture.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:09.959
But as we think about his arrival into the city of Haran, the Bible says that he came,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:13.079
in verse number 1, into the land of the people of the east.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:19.399
And notice the Bible tells us of his interactions as he arrives into the city, as he arrives

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.399
into Haran.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:25.000
And the first interaction that is recorded for us, down through really verse number 12,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.279
is his, excuse me, through verse number 8, are his interactions with these shepherds.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:33.000
He arrives at the place, and the Bible says that he looked, in verse number 2, and behold

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.959
a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:43.239
For out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:47.040
It says in verse number 3, and thither were all the flocks gathered, and they rolled the

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.200
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200
mouth in its place.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.359
And so God's giving us some information with regard to the behavior of these shepherds,

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:58.440
to the mode by which they operate.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.480
And we find, the Bible tells us, and they will give some information with regard to

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.160
this in verse number 8 as well, but these shepherds, they would all gather their flocks

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.760
together, and at a set time they would water all of the flocks once they arrived.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.480
And we find that it tells us that they would roll that stone from the well's mouth, according

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.559
to verse number 3, they would water the sheep, and then they would return the stone again

00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:22.920
to its place.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.880
And so Jacob arrives, he's understanding some things, he sees these shepherds that

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.359
are there, and he begins to have an interaction with them.

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:35.559
Notice in verse number 4 that he says unto them, my brethren, whence be ye?

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.000
And they said, of Haran are we?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.200
And there's not much interaction, not much discussion.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.159
They give a simple answer to the question that was asked by Jacob, and he then pries

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:53.520
and probes, if you will, and he says to them, know ye Laban, the son of Nahor?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520
And they said, we know him.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:59.559
Again, the conversation's not going real fast, real deep, right?

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:02.960
It's just kind of a, you asked a question, I gave you an answer.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.919
And Jacob is interacting with these shepherds, and perhaps these shepherds, maybe by the

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:13.380
tone is what we're seeing here, maybe they were a little bit concerned as to who this

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.080
new guy is that's coming to town, what's going on, why is he asking questions, so on and

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080
so forth.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:25.760
And we find that Jacob then says in verse number 6, it says, and he said unto them,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.640
is he well?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.599
And they said, he is well.

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:34.159
And behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:41.239
And he said, now Jacob is responding, he says, lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time

00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:47.799
that the cattle should be gathered together, water ye the sheep and go and feed them.

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:51.960
It's kind of interesting because he has this interaction in verse number 7, really you

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:58.119
don't see that there's any level of Jacob being shy whatsoever, he's going to give them

00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.119
some instruction.

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:00.039
He says that it's high day.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:06.679
day. It's not a time that the cattle, and that's a generic term, by the way. We would use the term

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:12.039
cattle to speak of cows, but this is a generic term to speak of livestock. And we see that,

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:17.719
speaking of the sheep in particular, and he says that they are to water the sheep and then go and

00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:23.319
feed them. And notice what they say in verse number eight. We cannot, until all the flocks

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:29.479
be gathered together, until they roll the stone from the well's mouth, then we water the sheep.

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:35.399
And so they would wait, instead of opening the well and watering, they'd wait for all of the

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:40.679
flocks to gather, and they would then water the sheep, and then they would return the stone

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:45.399
according to what the operation or process was given to us in verse number three. Notice it says

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:50.839
in that while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them. And

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:55.239
it came to pass in verse number 10, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's

00:10:55.239 --> 00:11:00.439
brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone

00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:05.879
from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. And so now we see

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:10.839
the interaction, yes, with the shepherds, but now I want you to see the interaction with Rachel.

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:16.599
The Bible tells us, and he now has watered the flocks. It says that Jacob went near at the end

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:21.079
of verse number 10. He rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban,

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:27.639
his mother's brother. Now, he's brand new into the city, and he's interacted with these shepherds.

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:32.199
He's asked some questions. Why aren't you watering them? It's not a time for them to be gathered.

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:38.999
They're to be watered and then go feed them. And he's inquired about his family, and we find that

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:44.999
now Rachel comes. He, Jacob, takes it upon himself to remove that stone so that the flock could be

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:51.399
watered. And he waters the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:56.439
and lifted up his voice and wept, according to verse number 11. I believe that there was great

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:02.199
joy. There was a measure of rejoicing in verse number 11. Remember, he had been sent out in

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:07.559
chapter number 28. He had been sent out from his house. He had been given direction as to

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:13.399
where to go and what to do. And now that he's arrived to the place where he's supposed to be,

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:19.399
now as he has been given that instruction to go to Bethuel or to the house of Bethuel,

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:23.479
thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban,

00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:29.879
thy mother's brother. And now I believe that Jacob is rejoicing. He kisses Rachel. He lifts

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:34.279
up his voice and wept. By the way, this isn't the way that someone would kiss someone here in

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:39.959
America. You have to understand the cultural aspects and what have you. And it's not just

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:44.359
that Jacob just, man, look, she's beautiful and kisses her, right? And it's not the way it works.

00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:50.759
You've got to understand the cultural aspects and those greetings and what have you. In fact,

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:57.559
Laban and Jacob have a similar type of an embrace. And it says that Jacob told Rachel that he was

00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:03.559
her father's brother in verse number 12, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:11.959
father. Now we find that it's now this interaction with Rachel is now giving her some insight as to

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:19.879
who this man is, this guy that just showed up. She comes to the well to water the flock, and

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:25.799
there's this new guy there. And he takes it upon himself to move the stone and to water the flock.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:31.799
And the Bible tells us that now she has insight as to who this guy is. It's Jacob, and she ran and

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:36.919
told her father at the end of verse number 12. And verse 13 tells us that it came to pass when Laban

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:43.239
heard the tidings of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:49.399
and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. In the first 12 verses of Genesis

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:58.039
chapter number 29, we see some interactions that Jacob has. His arrival to Haran, and we see these

00:13:58.039 --> 00:14:03.079
interactions, the one at the well with the shepherds, the one at the well with Rachel.

00:14:03.079 --> 00:14:07.719
And let me just say this. As we go on our journey with the Lord, we're going to have some interactions

00:14:07.719 --> 00:14:15.319
with people. We're going to meet some people along the way. We're going to meet a variety of people.

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:21.719
We're going to have interactions with people, and we must be mindful of that. We also must be mindful

00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:26.919
of the fact, and we don't see it here, and I'm just making some application as we think about

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:33.319
the parallels of Jacob's journey and our journey with the Lord and being the representatives that

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:40.119
we are, that in those interactions, that God has a purpose for those interactions. God has a plan

00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:46.119
for those interactions, and we need to be careful, even as we mentioned in Sunday school this morning,

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:52.679
that we'd understand that God's purpose in those interactions is for us to be used of Him.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:58.599
And what a joy it is that God would enable us, that He would involve us in His work.

00:14:59.319 --> 00:15:05.879
We find that here, there's no doubt this introductory introduction and

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:12.039
greetings with these shepherds. Of course, there would be many years in which Jacob would be in

00:15:12.039 --> 00:15:17.399
this region, and there'd be many more encounters with shepherds and what have you. But of course,

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:22.199
you think about the significance of this interaction with Rachel and how that those

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:28.759
things proceed, and we see the interactions lead to an invitation. The invitation is given,

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:35.479
it's not necessarily in verse number 13 where it's an actual invite that is given, but you notice

00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:40.759
near the end of the verse that it says, "...and brought him to his house." And I see the hospitality

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:48.919
of Laban. We see also, no doubt, the relief of Jacob. Again, Jacob went out. He went out

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:57.159
really from his presence of his family, knowing that his brother desired to kill him, right?

00:15:57.159 --> 00:16:02.839
Esau was ready to kill him. And you think about the departure there at the beginning of Genesis

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:08.119
chapter number 28, and I believe it was a great relief when he comes here and he interacts and

00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:14.119
he meets Laban, and Laban then brings him to his house. And what a relief that would be. According

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:19.319
to verse number 14, the Bible tells us that he was there for one month. And Laban said to him,

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:26.359
"'Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.' And he abode with him the space of a month."

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:35.799
Remember when the truth was given in Genesis chapter number 27 about Rebekah telling him to

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:41.879
leave? Do you remember how long Rebekah said? A few days, right? You remember that? We know,

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:47.079
and we noted in that passage at the end of Genesis chapter 27, that those days turned into years.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:53.479
But even in this initial stage of this initial departure, we find that he's there for a month.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:58.679
And after that month, there's now some discussion that takes place between Laban and Jacob,

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:03.719
and it leads us to our second point this evening. Not only Jacob's arrival in Haran, but I want you

00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:08.759
to notice Jacob's agreement with Laban. There's an agreement that is made, and we see how this

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:13.959
agreement, the details are provided to us in verses 15 through 20. Notice in verse 15,

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:20.199
Laban said unto Jacob, "'Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:27.559
not? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?' And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah,

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:32.439
and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and

00:17:32.439 --> 00:17:37.399
well-favored. And Jacob loved Rachel and said, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel,

00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:42.279
thy younger daughter.' And Laban said, "'It is better that I give her to thee,

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:48.359
than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.' And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:55.079
and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her." As we note the details of

00:17:55.079 --> 00:18:00.359
this agreement, we find that the question is asked by Laban in verse number 15, "'What shall

00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:08.999
thy wages be?' And we find that in verses 16 and 17 that the truth is given to us with regard to the

00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:16.119
two daughters of Laban, Leah and Rachel, and no doubt it would be in the best interest of Laban

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:22.199
to have his daughters married and understanding, again, some of the cultural aspects of those

00:18:22.199 --> 00:18:31.319
things. And we find that the question that is asked is answered by Jacob in verse number 18,

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:38.199
where he says, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.'" And we find that

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
it tells us that Jacob loved Rachel in verse number 18, and he's been given this truth to

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.679
Laban that, "'I will serve you for seven years.'" That's a long time. And he makes this commitment,

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:59.079
and we find that the details of the agreement, according to verse number 19, the terms of the

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:03.239
agreement are settled. I believe that they're agreed to, but we, of course, understand some

00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:08.919
of what takes place in this passage of Scripture. Notice what Laban says in verse number 19. He says,

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:15.959
"'It is better that I give her to thee.'" Who's he speaking of when he says her? Rachel, right?

00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:22.440
That was the question that was asked. Remember, when Laban said, "'What will your wages be?'

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:31.079
Jacob said, "'I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.'" And the Bible tells

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:39.479
us that Laban said, "'It is better that I give her to thee.'" He's speaking about Rachel to Jacob,

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:44.759
right? The follow? I know I'm kind of belaboring the point, but I am on purpose.

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:50.919
And the terms of the agreement are known and they're agreed to, and notice what Laban says.

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:55.959
He says, "'It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man.

00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:59.959
Abide with me.'" So when he says, "'Abide with me,' that's

00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:04.279
That's agreeing to the details that have already been provided.

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:06.039
Now let me ask you this question.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:12.719
Did Laban know about the custom in their country that he refers to in verse number 26?

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:13.719
Did he know?

00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:15.039
Laban knew about it, right?

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:19.559
Jacob didn't know about this custom, but Laban was aware of the custom.

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.759
Laban knows.

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:24.599
He says in verse number 26, it must not be so done in our country to give the younger

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:25.799
before the firstborn.

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:30.279
Did he know that in verse number 19 or was that just revealed to him afterwards?

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:32.839
He knew that.

00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:38.559
He was well aware of what the custom and the culture where he lived and where he had raised

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.559
his family.

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.319
He was well aware of it.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:47.919
But we find that as he's interacting with Jacob, he tells Jacob, it's better that I

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:50.559
give her to thee.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.399
Abide with me.

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:55.759
And so Jacob served seven years for Rachel.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:58.119
Again, that's a lengthy period of time.

00:20:58.119 --> 00:21:00.479
And the Bible tells us, what a thought.

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:05.319
It says in verse number 20, and they, those seven years, they seemed unto him but a few

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:06.319
days.

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:07.319
Why?

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:09.439
For the love he had to her.

00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:10.679
That's pretty good.

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:11.679
Amen?

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:15.439
All you guys that aren't romantic, you try to get something out of there, amen?

00:21:15.439 --> 00:21:16.879
And figure it out.

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:20.079
But the reality is that he had such love.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:24.359
It tells us in verse number 18 that Jacob loved Rachel.

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:31.239
And I believe that as Jacob is desiring to marry Rachel, as we see here in this passage

00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:36.839
of Scripture, those seven years passed and it seemed like just some days to him.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:37.839
Why?

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.159
Because it wasn't so much that he was just toiling in work.

00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:43.739
It wasn't the monotony of the day.

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:46.119
It wasn't the task at hand.

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:48.399
It was the prize that was before him.

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:49.999
Does that make sense?

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:50.999
Right?

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:55.399
He's thinking, I got to get this work done and then I'm going to have a bride.

00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:57.959
Kind of motivates you, right?

00:21:57.959 --> 00:22:02.399
And Jacob is in this place of being motivated and he's working.

00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:08.919
And as we will study, as we continue through the book of Genesis, we'll find that as the,

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:12.999
at the end of chapter number 30, the latter part, and of course, as you continue into

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:18.919
chapter number 31, you'll find that God blessed Laban for Jacob's sake.

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:24.339
And you'll read some of those things and no doubt Jacob was a hard worker.

00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:25.339
How do we see that?

00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:28.279
Well, as soon as he gets to the, to the well, what does he do?

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:30.279
He's like, why are you guys standing around?

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:32.999
It's not a time for the cattle to be gathered.

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:35.359
Like come on, let's, let's do what we're supposed to do, right?

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:38.019
That was his interaction with the shepherds, right?

00:22:38.019 --> 00:22:40.599
And so no doubt Jacob was a hard worker.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:42.159
He was diligent.

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:47.439
And I think that Laban found himself in a position where he is recognizing he's going

00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:53.799
to have some free labor and he's also going to have a husband for his daughter.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:59.479
Of course, all the while, he has Leah in mind, he has Leah in mind.

00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:02.839
That is, Laban has Leah in mind.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.239
And that's what we see in Jacob's agreement with Laban.

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:10.039
We see the details in verses 15 through 20, but I want you to see the deception in verses

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.959
21 through 30.

00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:17.719
The Bible tells us in verse number 21 that Jacob said unto Laban, give me my wife for

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:21.199
my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her.

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:25.219
And so we see that Jacob had fulfilled his end of the agreement.

00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:27.479
He had served for seven years for Rachel.

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:31.779
We see that in verse 20, we see in verse 21 that he comes to Laban.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:34.519
If I could use this terminology, it's payday.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:38.559
I've fulfilled my responsibility and now it's time for me.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:43.179
The agreement that we made is that I'm going to serve you for Rachel, and you said that

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:47.959
you would, it was better for you to give her to me than to another man, and so I'm ready

00:23:47.959 --> 00:23:48.959
for my wife.

00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:53.119
And we find that Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast in verse

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:54.119
number 22.

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:57.599
Again, this would be customary for this time and this culture.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.519
And you find that he's preparing for this wedding and all that's taking place.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:05.959
All the while, Laban knows what he's doing.

00:24:05.959 --> 00:24:08.719
Jacob has no idea what's going on.

00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:13.279
I think Jacob has every thought that he's going to be marrying Rachel, the agreement

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.999
that was made.

00:24:14.999 --> 00:24:20.279
And here we find that Laban's gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:26.839
and it came to pass in the evening, look in verse 23, that he took Leah, his daughter,

00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:28.879
and brought her to him.

00:24:28.879 --> 00:24:35.599
And he went in unto her and Laban gave unto his daughter, Leah, his maid for a handmaid.

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:39.679
And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah.

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:45.839
And he, Jacob, said to Laban, what is this thou hast done unto me?

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:49.559
Did not I serve with thee for Rachel?

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:56.559
Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:00.039
That's an interesting situation.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:02.239
I'm just going to leave it at that.

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:09.519
But I'm going to notice in verse number 26, I want you to think about this this evening

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:11.079
and I hope it's helpful for us.

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:17.559
I've meditated upon this and I think that there's something really important for us

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.559
to glean.

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:26.639
It says that Laban said, it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:28.839
the firstborn.

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:34.739
Isn't it interesting the verbiage that Laban uses?

00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:39.279
Why is it that the verbiage that Laban uses is of such interest to us?

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:48.359
Well, because in Jacob's own experience, there was a situation with the younger and the firstborn.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:54.159
And I think about the custom that is explained in verse number 26, and I think about the

00:25:54.159 --> 00:26:00.839
use of that word firstborn, and I think about Jacob hearing those words when Jacob, listen,

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:05.279
I think Jacob's probably not a very happy individual in verse number 25, okay?

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.719
Would you agree?

00:26:06.719 --> 00:26:12.439
When he goes to Laban and he says to Laban, what is this that thou hast done unto me?

00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:16.039
I think there's some emotion behind that, all right?

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:21.359
I think that he's probably pretty upset about what's transpired.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:23.599
He's very confused as to what's transpired.

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:26.239
I think there's a measure of emotion.

00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:27.419
He's irritated.

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.959
He says, did not I serve with thee for Rachel?

00:26:30.959 --> 00:26:33.239
Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

00:26:33.239 --> 00:26:37.999
And Laban begins to explain, and he provides this explanation that it must not be so done

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:42.559
in our country to give the younger before the firstborn.

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:48.679
And I just wonder, when Jacob heard that word firstborn, I wonder if it had an impact in

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:50.839
his life.

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:54.679
I wonder if perhaps he had been mindful.

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:58.799
You'll remember as we've studied here through Genesis chapter 29 at this point, there's

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:05.719
no reference whatsoever of Jacob explaining to Laban or to Rachel why he was there in

00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:07.519
the first place.

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:09.519
There's no explanation whatsoever.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:14.119
And we know all that has transpired in the life of Jacob, and we come to this place and

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:20.559
we see that Jacob is in this situation and he hears these words and he hears about the

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.799
custom.

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:27.519
Now why am I making this focus and this emphasis here?

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:34.319
Well, I believe that as we journey with the Lord, that God seeks to teach us things, that

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:40.519
God seeks to deal with us and to help us in our journey with Him.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:47.999
Some have given the idea of Genesis 29 that this is a great example of sowing and reaping

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:53.019
and so on and so forth, and you understand how Jacob deceived and he was a deceiver and

00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:57.439
all that he did with the birthright and the blessing and what you do, what you sow, you're

00:27:57.439 --> 00:28:01.239
going to reap and so on and so forth, and certainly there's a measure of that in this

00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:04.399
passage of Scripture.

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:10.919
But I also believe that as you look at Jacob in this passage of Scripture and you consider

00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:16.679
all that has transpired and you understand especially the end of chapter number 28 and

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:22.779
the change in Jacob's life, that yes, there is a measure of the sowing and reaping principle

00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:29.039
in view here, but I also believe that it's a situation where God is teaching Jacob some

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.479
important life principles.

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:37.319
I believe that Jacob is being taught by God the importance of seeking the face of God.

00:28:37.319 --> 00:28:40.079
I believe that he's learning some things.

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:45.679
See, Jacob is in this position where he's, again, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:51.479
there's no reference in Genesis chapter 29 of Jacob praying about any of these decisions,

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:54.599
about Jacob praying about any of these agreements.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:29:00.039
And no doubt as we journey in our life with the Lord, there are times and perhaps as we

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:04.199
started our journey that maybe we didn't pray about things the way that we pray about things

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:05.199
now.

00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:08.199
Maybe there are seasons in our life where we don't pray about things as often as we

00:29:08.199 --> 00:29:14.679
do at other times, and so God is teaching Jacob some truth here, and Jacob, no doubt,

00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:19.559
I believe that this is one of the things that God would use in the life of Jacob to really

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:22.079
humble him.

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.119
I think about the brothers of Joseph.

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:29.399
Do you remember when the brothers of Joseph will get to it in, I don't know how many months,

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:31.279
but we'll get to it eventually.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:35.599
But we think about the interaction with Joseph and his brothers, and you think about the

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:40.839
guilt and the conviction that they have as they stand before Joseph, and Joseph doesn't

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:46.039
reveal himself to them quite yet, and he's going through the process, and we find that

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:52.519
the visit is there, and all that takes place, and you'll remember the passage of Scripture,

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:58.959
the second visit, and all that's taking place, and of course as we go through and you find

00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:00.679
reveals himself, but you know,

00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:02.559
before he ever revealed himself,

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:05.879
there was a measure of brokenness in the lives

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:09.319
and the hearts of the people, his brothers,

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:11.839
and we believe, as you study throughout

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:14.999
the portions of scripture, and you see what's taking place,

00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:18.739
that their heart was breaking for Benjamin, remember?

00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:21.879
How is it, how are we gonna go back to dad?

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:24.959
I mean, this is going to absolutely destroy him.

00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:26.499
He's gonna go down to the grave.

00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:29.419
They're concerned, the brothers of Joseph are concerned,

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:31.539
and listen, did they have any concern

00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.939
on how they were gonna go to dad

00:30:33.939 --> 00:30:37.019
with the coat of many colors that was dipped in blood?

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:40.379
They didn't have any concern whatsoever, did they?

00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:41.699
They get that coat of many colors,

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:43.679
and they come to dad, and what do they say?

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:46.499
Do you know whose this is, right?

00:30:46.499 --> 00:30:48.339
And then what they do?

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:53.019
And the reality is that they had no remorse whatsoever.

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:55.579
They knew exactly where Joseph was,

00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:58.659
what they had done, what had transpired,

00:30:58.659 --> 00:31:02.499
and they didn't care how it would impact their father.

00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:04.379
But the reality is that years later,

00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:08.059
through some circumstances, God works and God breaks them.

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:12.699
I believe that God is using this in the life of Jacob

00:31:12.699 --> 00:31:17.439
to break him, to bring him to a greater level of humility.

00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:19.999
We don't see all of it in the next couple of chapters.

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:22.059
There's a number of things that continue

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:25.419
in the life of Jacob that are challenges and difficulties

00:31:25.419 --> 00:31:29.419
with this new walk with the Lord that he has

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:30.979
and all that's taking place.

00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:33.619
And so we find that he's given an explanation

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:35.299
with regard to the custom,

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:37.619
and the Bible tells us in verse number 27,

00:31:37.619 --> 00:31:38.939
notice what Laban says,

00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:42.939
fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also

00:31:42.939 --> 00:31:45.339
for the service which thou shalt serve

00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:48.939
with me yet seven other years.

00:31:48.939 --> 00:31:52.059
So here's what Laban is saying in verse number 27,

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:55.139
the week of festivities for the marriage to Leah

00:31:55.139 --> 00:31:56.139
were to be fulfilled.

00:31:56.139 --> 00:31:57.939
That's what he refers to in verse 27,

00:31:57.939 --> 00:31:59.699
when he says fulfill her week,

00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:01.859
he's referring to those seven days,

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:05.339
that week of festivities with regard to the marriage,

00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:07.019
fulfill that for Leah,

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:10.659
and we will give thee this also for the service,

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:14.499
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:18.779
So seven more years, and you can have Rachel.

00:32:19.619 --> 00:32:20.459
As your wife.

00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:22.179
Now notice it says this in verse 28,

00:32:22.179 --> 00:32:25.419
and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week,

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:28.339
and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also,

00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:31.619
and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid

00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:33.099
to be her maid,

00:32:33.099 --> 00:32:34.779
and it says that he went in also unto Rachel,

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:36.459
and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,

00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:38.779
and served with him yet seven other years.

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:41.499
And so Jacob really, as you look at the passage

00:32:41.499 --> 00:32:43.539
and see the way that it unfolds,

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:45.419
he marries Rachel,

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:48.499
he confronts Laban about the deception,

00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:51.139
and we find that Laban says, all right, fulfill her week,

00:32:51.139 --> 00:32:52.779
and I'll give you Rachel,

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:54.259
but you gotta serve seven more years,

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:55.339
he fulfills the week,

00:32:55.339 --> 00:32:57.939
he then is married to Rachel,

00:32:57.939 --> 00:33:00.939
and then he is going to serve for seven more years

00:33:00.939 --> 00:33:04.259
according to verse number 30 for Rachel.

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:05.579
And so think about Laban,

00:33:05.579 --> 00:33:07.299
and think about what's taking place here,

00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:09.859
Laban really sees the opportunity

00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:14.859
to get 14 years of basically free labor, right?

00:33:15.099 --> 00:33:17.139
And his older daughter,

00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:19.579
the Bible tells us that she was tender-eyed

00:33:19.579 --> 00:33:22.059
in verse number 17 and Rachel was beautiful,

00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:24.299
he now has a means, a way

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:27.579
in which he gets to get both of his daughters married,

00:33:27.579 --> 00:33:32.499
which again would be a desire of a dad of daughters.

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:35.899
Remember, think about this truth,

00:33:35.899 --> 00:33:39.019
who was it that brought the sheep to the well?

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.339
It was Rachel, right?

00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:43.899
So no doubt Laban was a place

00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:47.139
where he wanted to have his daughters married,

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:49.179
he needed some free labor,

00:33:49.179 --> 00:33:51.419
and so this deception takes place.

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.899
And we think about this deception

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:54.499
and we think about this situation

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:57.859
and we can offer all sorts of opinions,

00:33:57.859 --> 00:33:59.859
and again, there's definitely an aspect

00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:01.579
of sowing and reaping that's here,

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:04.899
there's an aspect in which God is molding and shaping

00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:07.219
and through the interactions that we deal with in life

00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:08.939
and through the experiences that we have

00:34:08.939 --> 00:34:10.499
as we journey with the Lord,

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:13.699
as we walk with the Lord, God's growing us.

00:34:14.499 --> 00:34:17.139
And sometimes he grows us through situations

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.499
that are less than desirable.

00:34:19.499 --> 00:34:21.899
I don't like being deceived, do you?

00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:26.699
I've never been deceived at this level, amen?

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.779
Mark laughed, I don't think any of you

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:30.979
have been deceived at this level, amen?

00:34:30.979 --> 00:34:34.099
But the reality is that none of us like to be deceived.

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:36.499
But as we seek to journey with the Lord,

00:34:36.499 --> 00:34:39.019
we're going to have experiences

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:42.119
where they're less than desirable experiences.

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:45.599
And how do we respond to those situations?

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.119
What do we do in those circumstances?

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.759
How is it that as we look at the life of Jacob

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:52.199
and we can see the historical context,

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.959
we see what happens, we understand,

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.839
we can follow the journey of Jacob

00:34:56.839 --> 00:34:59.999
and we'll see as we get into our next message,

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:01.519
really probably a couple of messages

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.759
of all of his children and the sons

00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:04.959
and you see all that takes place.

00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:06.759
But I really want us to think about

00:35:06.759 --> 00:35:09.239
as we could use a parallel in closing this evening

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:11.599
of really our journey with the Lord.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:14.979
Listen, our journey with the Lord isn't always easy.

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:18.799
Have you found that to be so?

00:35:18.799 --> 00:35:21.719
There's difficulties that we face.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:24.639
There are challenges along the way.

00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:27.159
As New Testament believers, I'm so thankful,

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.799
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:30.599
that we have the whole canon of Scripture

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:32.439
and we have truth that we can run to

00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:34.119
and we can seek the face of God

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.679
and we can know the will of God

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:37.559
and we can understand what God's plan is

00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:38.399
and we can follow it.

00:35:38.399 --> 00:35:41.399
But there's still some difficulties that we deal with

00:35:41.399 --> 00:35:44.399
and how we must trust him and how we must follow him

00:35:44.399 --> 00:35:46.079
and though we might be wronged

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.459
and though we might be deceived

00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:49.279
and though we might have adversity,

00:35:49.279 --> 00:35:50.879
that we keep our eyes on the Lord

00:35:50.879 --> 00:35:52.959
and we keep pushing forward,

00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:54.879
pressing forward, onward.

00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:58.599
As we look throughout the Word of God,

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:01.799
there's really not a Bible character

00:36:01.799 --> 00:36:04.439
that we would refer to as being

00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:06.459
some type of a hero of the faith,

00:36:06.459 --> 00:36:11.139
someone that their life is worth studying and emulating,

00:36:11.879 --> 00:36:14.179
but that did not have problems.

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:17.899
And this evening, as we think about our journey,

00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:20.179
listen, there are some that paint the idea

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:23.219
of a Christian life being a bed of roses

00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:25.659
and just trust Jesus

00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:27.779
and all your problems are gonna go away.

00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:30.379
No, no, you trust Jesus

00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:33.659
and he's with you through all of your problems.

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:35.619
Isn't that precious?

00:36:35.619 --> 00:36:37.739
I understand that man desires

00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:39.899
for all of his troubles to go away.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.699
But we live in a sin-cursed world, right?

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:47.819
Jacob, the very first experience

00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:51.459
after he leaves the place

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.339
where he met the Lord there in Bethel

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:55.499
and after he'd made the vows and the commitments

00:36:55.499 --> 00:36:58.419
and after he gets to Haran

00:36:58.419 --> 00:37:00.459
and he meets Rachel and he meets Laban

00:37:00.459 --> 00:37:01.419
and all that takes place,

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:03.299
seven years, he's deceived

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:05.639
and it's a great level of deception.

00:37:10.379 --> 00:37:13.679
They're trials and difficulties that we face in life.

00:37:15.699 --> 00:37:18.939
Someone that said that the trust Christ

00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:22.139
and they've explained and tried to paint the picture

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:25.019
that the Christian life is like a bed of roses,

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:29.359
the reality is that knowing, think about this truth.

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:33.259
All men have problems.

00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:36.819
All mankind has problems, right?

00:37:37.819 --> 00:37:42.099
Have you ever thought in your life this thought,

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:44.959
I don't know how they do it without Christ?

00:37:46.779 --> 00:37:48.799
You've had that thought, have you not?

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:51.219
You see people that suffer, you see people that struggle,

00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:53.939
you see people that deal with adversity,

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.299
but so do we, but we have Christ.

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:03.139
We have the Lord with us and he sustains us

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:05.299
and he helps us and he guides us

00:38:05.299 --> 00:38:07.259
and he has purposes and he's growing us

00:38:07.259 --> 00:38:08.979
and he's molding us and listen,

00:38:08.979 --> 00:38:12.659
sometimes the molding process isn't very comfortable.

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:16.139
Sometimes he uses some things

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:19.459
like using that phrase firstborn

00:38:19.459 --> 00:38:22.019
where it's a flood of memories that must come back

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:24.439
in the heart of Jacob and the mind of Jacob

00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:27.099
of all that he did to Esau

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:29.139
and how he deceived Esau

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:31.779
and all that took place and all that transpired

00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:34.779
and no doubt there would be some recollection

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:38.779
of those things and God will use those types of things

00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:42.299
in our lives to conform us to the image of his dear son

00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:45.959
and I find that in the life of Jacob

00:38:45.959 --> 00:38:49.259
as we chronicle his journeys, as we chronicle his life

00:38:49.259 --> 00:38:50.939
and we trace his steps,

00:38:50.939 --> 00:38:54.419
that there are definitely some parallels for us.

00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.439
This evening, it is a joy to walk and talk with the king.

00:38:59.399 --> 00:39:02.119
It is an absolute joy to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:03.319
as our personal savior

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:07.399
but our problems don't go away overnight

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:13.839
but we have the Lord to help us through our problems.

00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:17.759
Listen, it's interesting that even though Jacob

00:39:17.759 --> 00:39:22.239
doesn't pray, in fact, it's a while before Jacob

00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:24.279
really prays and seeks the face of God,

00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:25.619
there's a lot of things that take place.

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:27.759
We're at 14 years right now.

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:29.799
The end of chapter number,

00:39:29.799 --> 00:39:31.199
well, we're at seven years and a week

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:32.999
and then he's gonna serve for seven more years

00:39:32.999 --> 00:39:34.039
and by the end of the chapter,

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.839
you're gonna be near 14 years

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:38.839
because he's going to say, I'm ready to depart.

00:39:38.839 --> 00:39:41.119
So he's fulfilled that other seven years

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:43.159
by the end of the chapter

00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:46.999
and still there's no record of Jacob praying at that point

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:48.679
but you know what's interesting?

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:50.439
God continued to bless Jacob.

00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:56.719
Laban recognized the blessing that God had put in his life

00:39:56.719 --> 00:39:58.199
because of Jacob.

00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:01.559
God always fulfills His promises.

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:06.159
And God promised that He would be with Jacob and He would bless Jacob.

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:07.159
And He did.

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:10.019
And what a blessing that is.

00:40:10.019 --> 00:40:14.799
This evening, we're all at a different place of our journey with the Lord.

00:40:14.799 --> 00:40:19.279
But wherever you are, wherever I am in our journey with the Lord, I would say this, there

00:40:19.279 --> 00:40:22.839
are a number of interactions that we're going to have with all kinds of people.

00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:28.919
We're going to have various experiences, some that are less than desirable.

00:40:28.919 --> 00:40:29.919
We're going to be hurt.

00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:32.159
We're going to be deceived.

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:40.999
But through it, on our journey, God is molding us and shaping us and helping us to be who

00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:43.119
we're supposed to be in Christ.

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:48.279
Remember that song, He's Still Working on Me?

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:53.879
See, He created all of the universe in just six days, right?

00:40:53.879 --> 00:40:54.879
Powerful.

00:40:54.879 --> 00:40:58.679
But see, He's still working on me, and He's still working on you.

00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:02.839
And by the way, we ought to be thankful that He's working on us, amen?

00:41:02.839 --> 00:41:10.719
And He's, in only the way that He can, as the potter with the clay, He's shaping us.

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:16.979
And sometimes there's some rough edges that have to be taken care of, and God has His

00:41:16.979 --> 00:41:19.699
ways of taking care of those things.

00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:23.939
And so as we journey with the Lord, help us to keep our eyes on the Lord.

00:41:23.939 --> 00:41:25.459
Father, we love You.

00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:26.699
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:27.699
Thank You for the day.

00:41:27.699 --> 00:41:28.699
Thank You for the blessings.

00:41:28.699 --> 00:41:35.819
As we think about the life of Jacob, we chronicle his life, we trace his steps, we see the events.

00:41:35.819 --> 00:41:43.099
I hope tonight that we could take, by way of application, some of this parallel of our

00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:48.739
own journey with You, that we'd learn some things not to do, and we'd learn some things

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.659
to do.

00:41:50.659 --> 00:41:56.419
God, that You'd help us to seek Your face, that You'd help us to obey You.

00:41:56.419 --> 00:41:59.259
Such a blessing to have the whole canon of Scripture.

00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:08.299
And Lord, I pray that You'd be pleased with our lives, that we'd walk worthy as the believers

00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:11.499
in Ephesus are challenged to do so.

00:42:11.499 --> 00:42:15.459
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments of invitation as only You can, and

00:42:15.459 --> 00:42:16.459
we'll thank You for it.

00:42:16.459 --> 00:42:17.579
In Christ's name we pray.
