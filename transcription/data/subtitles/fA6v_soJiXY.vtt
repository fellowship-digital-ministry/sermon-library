WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
As we continue with this thought here on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
doing what we ought to do, doing what we ought to do.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Last week we talked about from Ephesians 6 that we ought to proclaim the gospel,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
and we considered three thoughts here from 1 John chapter 4.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
We're really going to use a verse here, and then we're going to jump and look at a number of other portions of Scripture,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
and then eventually get back to the book of 1 John.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
So once we leave the book of 1 John, keep a marker there because we will come back for the bulk of the message,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
but we will look at a number of passages by way of introduction this evening.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.500
The subject of brotherly love is regularly addressed throughout the New Testament.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
I think as I begin to study the New Testament, begin to think about and ponder

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
this subject of loving one another and having brotherly love as the Bible would refer to it as,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.500
I think there's a great contrast that we see between two churches that are mentioned in the New Testament.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.500
There's the church at Thessalonica, and it's interesting as you consider the church at Thessalonica,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.500
the Bible tells us that they are given the admonition in the first letter

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
that they would increase more and more in their love one for another.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.500
And you go to 2 Thessalonians chapter number 1, and you find that the Bible tells us

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.500
that the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.500
And what a great testimony of a local church that is the apostle Paul and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.500
is writing back to them and he's commending them because why?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Well, their love toward one another is abounding.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.500
And what a blessing, what a great testimony for a local church.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
And then I think of the contrast of the church at Corinth.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.500
And we think about the church at Corinth, and we're told in the first chapter

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.500
that there in the church in Corinth that there are divisions and there are contentions among them.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.500
So I want you in your mind to consider these two different churches this evening

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
as we enter into this thought that we have from 1 John 4, 11,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
when the Bible says in this verse of Scripture,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
And I've titled the message tonight, We Ought to Love One Another.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
And we see this contrast between these two churches.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
A church at Thessalonica that we've often referred to as being a model church,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.500
a good church, not a perfect church, but a good church,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500
a church that was following the instruction that they had been given,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500
a church that is commended for a number of things,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.500
but specifically being commended because their love one toward another has abounded.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
And then we think, he uses the word that it aboundeth,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.500
and we think about the church at Corinth where they have divisions and contentions.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.500
What would you rather be a part of, the church at Corinth or the church at Thessalonica?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
I hope that you'd say the church at Thessalonica, right?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
It's kind of a no-brainer.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
If you go and there's this one option, you visit a church,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500
and I know sometimes you move to a new area, what have you.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Some of you have been members here for a long time,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500
but when you go to a new area, you move and you go look for a church.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
I remember the latter part of my dad's career in the Marine Corps

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.500
because the home is where the military, the Marine Corps sends you,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500
and you'd get transferred, and guess what you have to do?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500
You have to find a new church.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500
And if I had the opportunity to visit these two churches,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.500
and I went to Corinth and divisions and contentions and all of this,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500
and then I went over to the church at Thessalonica

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
and I saw a group of believers that loved one another,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500
I think I would choose the church at Thessalonica

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.500
to join and to worship with and to serve with, amen?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.500
And so we find that this subject matter of loving one another

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
is something that, again, it's a subject that is brought up regularly

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
throughout the New Testament.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Hold your place here in 1 John.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
I use 1 John 4.11 as the springboard

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
because the Bible says that we ought also to love one another.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
We'll come back to 1 John and actually take a very quick walk

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
through several chapters of the book

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
as we deal with the bulk of the message this evening.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
But turn back, if you will, to the Gospel of John,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500
holding your place there in the book of 1 John.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Turn over to John chapter 13, if you will.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500
John chapter 13, we reference part of this passage of Scripture

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.500
on Sunday evening where Jesus is washing the feet of the disciples.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500
As we come to the end of the text of Scripture,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Jesus is speaking to them and He's obviously letting them know

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.500
that He was going to go to Jerusalem and He was going to be killed

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
and He was going to raise from the dead

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.500
and He was going to fulfill the plan that was determined

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
before the foundation of the world.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.500
But notice this truth that is given to us in John 13 and verse 34.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
The Bible says,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.500
It's interesting that Jesus really is ending the 13th chapter

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500
with this instruction of this new command

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.500
for He begins the beginning of the chapter in verse number one.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
Notice what the Bible says.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
And then He says,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.500
That you love one another as I have loved you,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500
that you also love one another.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
His love is a perfect love.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.500
And we find that He has given this new commandment to the disciples.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.500
John, of course, as he would write in the book of 1 John,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500
as we'll get there in just a moment,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.500
he heard these words, he was used of God to record

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500
these words that were spoken in John 13,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.500
and so he knew about this subject.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
Let's look over, if you will, the book of Romans in chapter number 12.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
Look at Romans chapter 12.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
In Romans chapter number 12 in verse number 9,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
the Bible says this,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500
Romans 12 in verse 9,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.500
That word is an important word for us to understand

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.500
when the Bible says let love be without dissimulation.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500
The word means to be sincere.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500
It means to have no hypocrisy, to be unfeigned.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500
That's what the word means, dissimulation.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
And so we live in a society sometimes

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.500
that really doesn't know how to define love as God defines love.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
They misdefine the love of God regularly,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500
but they also misunderstand love,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500
that we're to have one for another.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
Sometimes we have this I'll do you a favor,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.500
you do me a favor kind of mentality,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.500
but here God says let love be without dissimulation.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.500
It's to be sincere without any hypocrisy.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.500
There's no wrong motive in our love.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.500
We're to love as Christ loved.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.500
In 1 Corinthians 13, we're familiar with this portion of Scripture.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500
At the 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.500
we speak much about the chapter that deals with charity or with love.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
And notice what God says about the importance of love.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.500
In verse number one of 1 Corinthians 13, He says this,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
and have not charity,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500
I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.500
And though I have the gift of prophecy

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500
and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
and though I have all faith,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500
so that I could remove mountains and have not charity,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.500
what does it say?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500
I am nothing.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500
Verse three,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.500
and though I give my body to be purned,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500
and have not charity,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.500
it profiteth me nothing.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.500
Notice how charity is described,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.500
it suffereth long, is kind,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500
charity envieth not,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500
charity vaunteth not itself,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.500
is not puffed up,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500
doth not behave itself unseemly,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
seeketh not her own,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.500
is not easily provoked,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.500
thinketh no evil,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500
rejoiceth not in iniquity,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500
but rejoiceth in the truth,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500
beareth all things,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
believeth all things,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
hopeth all things,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500
endureth all things,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.500
and then notice the first phrase of verse number eight,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.500
charity never faileth.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500
It says at the end of the chapter in verse 13,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.500
And now abideth faith, hope, charity.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.500
These three.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.500
But the greatest of these is charity.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.500
The greatest is charity.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.500
I mentioned about the church in Thessalonica,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.500
where the Bible instructs them in the first epistle

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.500
that they are to increase in their love one toward another

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.500
in 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.500
in verses nine and 10.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.500
It's an interesting statement that is made here

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
because Paul is writing to them

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
to give them an encouragement,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.500
but he says even in giving them this admonition,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500
this encouragement to love one another,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500
he says you're already doing it.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500
Have you ever had a situation

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500
where you're teaching somebody

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
or you're instructing somebody to do something

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.500
that they're not doing,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500
but then you also have times

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500
in which you're instructing someone

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500
to do something that they're currently doing,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500
and what are you doing?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.500
You're encouraging them to continue.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.500
Like, hey, this path that you're taking is the right path.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500
You're doing right,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.500
and I want to cheer you on to continue and to increase.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.500
Don't get satisfied.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.500
Don't get kind of comfortable.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.219
with where you've gotten to, no, keep pushing forward.

00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:05.820
And that's what Paul is doing here.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.979
Notice in 1 Thessalonians 4, in verse number nine,

00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:12.060
he says, but as touching brotherly love,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.939
ye need not that I write unto you.

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:14.779
Why?

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:15.600
Because look at what he says,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.379
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:22.500
And indeed, verse number 10, ye do it.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.340
Do what?

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.120
Love one another toward all the brethren,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.979
which are in all Macedonia.

00:10:28.979 --> 00:10:31.639
I mean, that's a good testimony, isn't it?

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:34.000
But then notice what he says at the end of verse number 10,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.639
but we beseech you, brethren,

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:41.639
that ye increase more and more.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.119
We can never love with the same kind of love

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:47.080
that God does on our own.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.000
God is perfect,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.779
but we find that we are to increase more and more.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.240
We're not to get comfortable.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.360
Sometimes what happens in life,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.459
and this can happen in a variety of arenas of life,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.340
but we can deal with specifically here this evening

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.019
in the spiritual life,

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.019
is there's some times in which we can kind of

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.980
throw it into neutral and coast and think,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.739
we're kind of in a good spot.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.339
But you understand that's a bad decision,

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.300
because there's really no just kind of middle ground.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.739
We're either going forward or we're going backward.

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:23.339
And the reality is that we can't just get comfortable

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:25.239
with where we've gotten to.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.860
We must see this admonition to increase more and more.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.900
And in 1 Peter 4 and verse 8,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.739
you don't need to turn there.

00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:33.120
Turn back to 1 John, if you will.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.059
We'll look there at 1 John chapter 3.

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:36.459
But in 1 Peter, I'll read it to you

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:37.980
as you're turning to 1 John.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.860
In 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse number 8,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.220
the Bible says, and above all things,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.220
have fervent charity among yourselves,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.059
for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:50.660
And what a great truth,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.500
that we're to have fervent charity,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.220
one toward another.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.800
Now we understand as we come back here

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.199
to the book of 1 John,

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:00.819
and really deal with the bulk of the thought this evening

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:02.959
that we find in chapter 4,

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:05.500
when the Bible says, beloved, if God so loved us,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.240
we ought also to love one another.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.960
John knew God's love.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.279
In fact, many times during the writing

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.880
of the Gospel of John,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.520
John refers to himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.380
John understood something about the love of God.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.740
John understood, he heard the words

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.419
that we read a moment ago,

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:30.220
that are recorded for us in John chapter number 13,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.000
when Jesus said, and John is there,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.500
I give you this new commandment.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.100
And he says in the text of Scripture,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.160
that by this, by your love one for another,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.860
will all men know that you're my disciples.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.880
John heard those words.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.220
Now God is using the apostle John

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.080
to write to these that are being addressed

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.520
in the book of 1 John, these believers.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.960
This book is written to those that are saved,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.360
and we find that John is writing,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.839
throughout the book of John,

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:06.160
there's many references to this subject of brotherly love.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.320
We find that with the many references

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.880
to the subject of brotherly love,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.720
and we'll touch on several of them here in just a moment,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.360
we find that John is giving us some valuable instruction

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.339
with regard to this subject,

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.660
that we ought to love one another.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.880
We find that John, as he's giving this instruction

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.259
throughout the book of 1 John,

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:28.380
one thing that we find repeatedly,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.020
is this idea of not only our fellowship,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.460
but we find that John points out for us

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.339
throughout this epistle, or this little letter,

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:41.100
this little epistle, that we have birthmarks,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.699
evidences of being saved.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.880
These things that are pointed out,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.740
one of them being our love one for another,

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.559
it's not that we love one another

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.240
and that's how we get saved,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.520
it's not that we love one another

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.800
and that's how we stay saved,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800
you know that, you're aware of that,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.639
but he says that if we are saved,

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:04.320
the evidence, one of the evidences,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.960
one of the birthmarks is going to be

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.839
that we're gonna love one another.

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:09.639
So notice with me what he tells us

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:11.399
in 1 John chapter three,

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:14.119
I believe that our love one for another,

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.500
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.140
reveals our conversion,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.440
it reveals that we've been born again.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.179
And in 1 John chapter number three,

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:23.940
notice in verse number 10,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.779
the Bible says,

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:27.079
in this the children of God are manifest

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:28.579
and the children of the devil,

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:31.980
whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.660
neither he that loveth not his brother.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.940
For this is the message that you heard from the beginning,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.220
that we should love one another.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.339
He uses an example in verse number 12,

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:44.359
not as Cain, who was of that wicked one

00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:45.239
and slew his brother,

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:47.059
and wherefore slew he him?

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:48.559
Because his own works were evil

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.040
and his brother's righteous,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.799
marvel not my brethren if the world hates you.

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.220
And then notice verse 14,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.200
we know, I love when the Bible starts

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.239
with those two words,

00:14:59.239 --> 00:15:02.200
we referenced several of those last week,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.559
we know that we have passed from death unto life,

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:07.459
why?

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:09.299
Because we love the brethren.

00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:11.040
You understand that there are gonna be times

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.540
in your life,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.820
I'm so thankful that God has given us

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.899
some of these birthmarks,

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:18.059
these evidences of being saved,

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:18.899
because there's some time,

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:22.339
you know, some people base their confidence

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.920
of their conversion on their feelings.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.059
Have you ever had a bad day?

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:27.980
You have some feelings,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.339
you don't feel so hot,

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.940
you don't feel so,

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.779
you know what I'm saying?

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:34.820
Listen, my confidence is not how I'm feeling

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.660
from day to day,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.179
because my feelings change from day to day,

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:39.640
and so do yours.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.579
You can be the most, you know,

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:44.540
kind of laid back individual,

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.579
but the reality is that we have seasons

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.959
in our life when our feelings are gonna change.

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:53.260
But here we find that he says we know

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.579
that we have passed from death unto life,

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.420
why?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.619
Because we love the brethren.

00:15:58.619 --> 00:16:01.899
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:04.859
And so we find here that it reveals our conversion,

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:07.859
the reality, I've said this before,

00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:10.399
that we, when we're born again,

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.839
there's something,

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.559
the Bible talks about that his spirit's in us,

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:17.299
and his spirit bears witness with us,

00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:19.600
but I believe also with one another.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.559
You ever come to a presence,

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:22.720
I feel that this is gonna happen for us next week

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.920
when we're in Panama,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.480
there are gonna be some people in Panama

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.239
that I'm not gonna be able to communicate with effectively.

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:30.420
They speak a different language than I do,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.459
they know more maybe English words

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:33.559
than I know Spanish words,

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.839
but there's gonna be some difficulty.

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.399
When I was in Mexico several years ago

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.480
on a missions trip,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.100
there were several people that, man,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.359
I didn't, we couldn't speak two words to each other,

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:44.880
they just knew zero English.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.079
But you know what's awesome, Bart,

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:50.679
is that there was just something about just being together.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:52.880
It was like the Holy Spirit was in them

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.440
and the Holy Spirit was in me,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.119
and we were just having fellowship

00:16:57.119 --> 00:16:59.040
without even being able to communicate.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.200
It was an amazing experience.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.000
And again, not that experience is everything,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.839
but it's one of those things that when you're saved

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.760
and the Holy Spirit lives within you

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.480
and the Holy Spirit dwells within another believer,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.320
we have love one for another,

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.920
we wanna be with each other, amen?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.079
And that's the way it ought to be.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.760
Listen, I have more in common with saved people

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.480
than I do with lost people, amen?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.040
I don't care if the lost people are blood relatives.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.079
I'm saying to you that we have more in common

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:35.760
with our saved brothers and sisters in Christ

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.320
and we have richer and deeper

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.720
and more fulfilling fellowship

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.079
than we can with a lost person,

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:45.440
even if they're a blood relative.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.760
I don't mean that to be unkind.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.679
I'm not lacking grace.

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.519
I'm just being honest with you.

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:53.799
That's the way it is.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:55.799
And if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:59.480
you can remember when you didn't have love for the brethren

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.079
because you weren't saved, but then you get saved,

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:03.160
you get into a church,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.200
and it's something amazing about that love.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.019
It's an evidence.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:09.519
And so it reveals our conversion.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:12.239
Number two, here from the book of 1 John,

00:18:12.239 --> 00:18:14.640
it reveals our walk with God.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.839
Reveals our walk with God.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:16.679
What do I mean by that?

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:19.320
Well, turn back, if you will, to the second chapter,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.399
1 John chapter two,

00:18:21.399 --> 00:18:22.559
and notice what the Bible says

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.440
beginning in verse number seven.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.160
It says, brethren, I write no new commandment unto you,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.079
but an old commandment,

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:32.000
which you heard from, had from the beginning.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.359
The old commandment is the word

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.280
which you have heard from the beginning.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.960
Again, a new commandment I write unto you,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.239
which thing is true in him and in you,

00:18:39.239 --> 00:18:40.719
because the darkness is passed

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:42.520
and the true light now shineth.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.080
He that saith he is in the light

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.599
and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.

00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:52.159
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light,

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:54.299
and there is none occasion of stumbling in him,

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.719
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:59.679
and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth,

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.640
because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.359
It's amazing to me, we used,

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:08.099
I preached from 1 John back in 2022 as our theme.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.119
It was walk in the light from verse number seven

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:13.520
of chapter one, and I was just so,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.280
God used this verse in 2021 in 1 John 2, 7

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.400
and just got my attention with it,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.320
and then we ended up using it for the whole theme for 2022,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.599
but the Bible says, but if we walk in the light

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:26.359
as he is in the light,

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:29.919
we have fellowship one with another,

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:33.520
and that was the part where God just grabbed my attention,

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.479
because yes, we have fellowship with him.

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:37.039
If we walk in the light as he is in the light,

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.659
sure, we have fellowship with him,

00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:41.460
but he says that we have fellowship one with another,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.479
and so we see as we take this truth

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:50.859
and then look at what John says in 1 John 2, 7-11,

00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:53.719
that we're walking, if we're loving our brother,

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:55.320
we're abiding in the light.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.159
We're walking with the Lord.

00:19:58.159 --> 00:19:59.320
We're doing.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.000
That which were to do and it's that evidence 1st John 4 and verse 20 says if a man say I love God and hate it

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.420
This brother. He is a liar you say pastor. That's pretty strong. Yeah, it's what God said

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.880
If a man say I love God and hate hath his brother he is a liar

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.400
For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen well

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.500
You just don't understand we have two different personalities. We just can't

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.200
Oh, hold on if you're saved by the grace of God, and they're saved by the grace of God

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520
We've been given a commandment to love one another

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.100
Amen

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.320
To love one another notice you can't do this in your own in your own power in your own spirit

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.760
The Holy Spirit of God who indwells us. He's the one that enables us to do it the fruit of the Spirit is

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.200
Help me

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.800
Love right is it not is that how it begins and so we find the the fruit of the Spirit is love joy

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.800
Peace long-suffering so on and so forth and so we find

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.000
That that truth, but I want you to also see this and then I'll get back

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.600
We'll look at a kind of wrap it up put some application in but in Romans chapter number five

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960
God says this you don't need to turn there

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.880
I'll read it for you, but in in Romans 5 in verse number 5 the Bible says in hope make it not a shame because

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.600
The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.440
By the Holy Ghost which is given unto us

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.320
I

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.400
Just as I as I understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.400
And I understand the the indwelling of the Spirit the filling of the Spirit. We read a verse like this

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:45.320
We understand we're to love one another we ought to love one another but here we get an understanding of how this is accomplished

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.320
It's because the Holy Spirit of God

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520
He is the one that

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:56.920
Indwells us and fills us and it says that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.360
Which is given unto us?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.920
What a joy

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.280
To see how God makes a difference in people's lives and can give us a love

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.920
For the brethren were to love one another now

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.240
Let me ask this and we'll kind of jump into some application this evening

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.200
We talked about hey, we ought to love one another Paul says the believers at Thessalonica you you're doing it

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200
Well, how did Paul know that they were doing it?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.120
You ever wonder that I mean in first Thessalonians 4 verse 9

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.320
He says I'm gonna give you this commandment that you love one another you already know this been and in fact

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.680
You do it toward all the brethren. How did Paul know that they loved one another?

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.440
How did he know that they loved all the brethren in Macedonia?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.120
Well, I will say this that love is not just words. It's actions

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:51.120
Notice what the Bible says in 1st John 3 I kept you over there in 1st John and then we're gonna move to a few

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.280
Other places but in 1st John chapter number 3 notice what the Bible says in verse number 18

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.840
First John 3 in verse 18 my little children. Let us not love in word neither in tongue now

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.640
It doesn't mean that we should never say I love you to somebody. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.120
Verbalize our love but you understand people have said this before words are cheap

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:21.000
Right. Have you ever heard somebody say that words are cheap? You can say whatever you want to say, but the reality he says listen

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.880
let us not love in word neither in tongue, but

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.080
indeed and in truth

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.240
So we we think about it. I kind of look at verse 18. It's talk verse action

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.680
and so for Paul to say to the church of the

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.080
There in Thessalonica to say to them. I'm gonna give you this admonition to love

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.440
But you're already doing it. And now I want you to increase more and more. How did he know they were doing it?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
Well their actions revealed

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:58.400
He was aware of the testimony came back that they loved the brethren

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.800
So very quickly, what does love look like when we talk about the subject of brotherly love again?

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.240
You come to church on Wednesday night. We ought to proclaim the gospel as we dealt with last week

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.120
Okay, we understand the truth, but then how do we do it? What's the application?

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.740
How do I if I know remember knowing what we ought to do doesn't mean that we do it

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.440
Amen

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.640
But if we know what we ought to do and how to do it

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.279
It goes a long way to enabling us to do it

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:33.000
and so we find here this evening three simple thoughts in closing on what love looks like and how as

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:40.040
We love one another loving the brethren. What does this look like? Well, I love therefore I pray

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.360
I love therefore I pray. What is how do I how do I see that in the scriptures?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.160
Well, thanks for asking turn to the book of Philippians and look at Philippians chapter number one

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.160
and I want you to see what what Paul says is right into the church at Philippi and

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.000
Paul was there in Philippi amazing things that happen

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.640
You can read during the second missionary journey in the gospel in the in the book of Acts and see how God has worked

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.240
He's writing this letter back to the church at Philippi

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.480
Roughly 10 to 12 years after his first arrival in Philippi now 10 to 12 years a long time

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.080
It's it's not that long, but it's a it's a pretty good piece of time

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:25.119
that's passed and 10 to 12 13 maybe years passed between Paul's arrival there in

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:33.200
Philippi and now writing this letter and notice what the Bible says in verse number 3 Paul says I thank my God

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.880
Upon every remembrance of you. This was the verse that the missionary brother Barrett used

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.880
I read it tonight when he wrote wrote us that letter

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.320
For giving that love offering from the vacation Bible school penny offering to help them

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.839
But Paul says I thank my God upon every remembrance of you

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.279
Always notice in every prayer of mine for you all making requests

00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:01.820
With joy skip down for sake of time to verse number 7

00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:06.600
The Bible says even as it is meet for me to think this of you all why?

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:14.520
Because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:19.240
Ye all are partakers of my grace

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.679
He tells them in verse number 9 and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.000
So Paul has them in his heart

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:36.600
Therefore he's praying for them. He loves them and his action one of the actions of loving is that he's praying

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.320
You know who you pray for you pray for the people you love

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.200
You know who you pray for you pray for the people that are on your heart

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600
Am I not right?

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.640
That's who you pray for

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.279
The Holy Spirit of God has ever happened in your life that the Holy Spirit bring somebody to your mind

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.399
Bring somebody your heart and you just begin to pray for him. Maybe you don't even know what they're dealing with

00:27:00.399 --> 00:27:03.920
You're not sure of the search a certain situation or circumstance

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.559
But but the Holy Spirit of God prompts you why you they're on your heart

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:13.960
The people in our heart the people that we love and Paul says I thank my God upon every remembrance of you

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.200
and by the way, I'm thinking of you often why because you're in my heart because I love you and

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.600
Because I love you I'm praying for you

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.520
Do you understand tonight that the greatest thing that we as believers can do one for another is pray for each other?

00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:31.160
honestly

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.160
We live in a society. We live in a time in an era where prayer has been

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:42.200
Neglected when prayer has just been set to the side when people say well

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:48.040
All I can do is pray for you as if it's an apology. Have you ever heard somebody say it that way as

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.480
If it's an apology that all I can do is pray for you

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.899
In fact, it's the greatest thing I could ever do for you is pray for you

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.880
People sometimes they don't want your prayer. They want your money. They don't whatever it might be

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.640
We see we get faced with some of these things

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:10.480
But the reality is that when we enter into our prayer closet and we get busy

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.119
Interceding on the behalf of our brother and sister in Christ, man. That's because we love them

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.520
It's work

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.059
But because I love I pray number two because I love I serve

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:28.600
Because I love I serve notice in Galatians chapter 5

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.520
Just a few pages back in your Bible Galatians chapter number 5 and notice verse 13 and 14

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.520
You know, it's a blessing to be able to serve the Lord. It's a blessing to be able to serve each other

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200
It's a blessing

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.100
In Galatians 5 in verse 13, it says for brethren

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.760
You've been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion of the flesh, but by love

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320
serve

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.000
one another

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.880
For all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:05.119
That's going back to that old commandment from the Old Testament

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.400
Jesus said love as I love to his disciples and we understand that of course

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.320
We're still familiar with that commandment to love as I love

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:18.440
What a great truth and we say that we find here says but by love

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.960
serve one another

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.960
What a joy to be able to serve each other

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.840
To be able to show our love for someone by serving them

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:35.000
Not because we have to but because we get to not because we're guilty

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.400
But because we have a heart of love and we want to serve those what Hebrews says in Hebrews chapter 6 with this idea of serving

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.400
one another in

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:47.559
Hebrews chapter number 6

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:59.359
In Hebrews 6 in verse 10 the Bible says for God is not unrighteous to forget notice

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:06.579
your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward His name, how did they show

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:07.579
it?

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:11.119
In that you have ministered to the saints and do minister."

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:15.839
You know, it's a blessing to serve one another.

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:16.839
It's not a problem.

00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:21.319
I'm going to use, and I think it's Wednesday night crowd, I think we can understand this

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:26.879
and I don't mean it to be an embarrassment, but Mr. Don has not been loving the idea of

00:30:26.879 --> 00:30:29.359
having to be in a wheelchair.

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:30.399
Could we agree with that?

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:34.519
It bothers him that he's got to be wheeled in here.

00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:39.079
And he said to me on more than one occasion, I'm sorry to be a bother.

00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:41.359
You know what I tell him every time he says that?

00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:44.519
It's not a bother at all.

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:47.219
We are glad to be able to do it.

00:30:47.219 --> 00:30:48.719
And here's what I told Mr. Don a few weeks ago.

00:30:48.719 --> 00:30:54.979
I said, now, Mr. Don, if we can back up about 15 years ago and somebody needed someone to

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:57.259
push them in a wheelchair, would you do it?

00:30:57.259 --> 00:30:58.259
And he said, absolutely.

00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:05.019
I said, okay, so let's not have the conversation anymore.

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:07.059
We get to serve one another.

00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:08.219
Why?

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:11.259
Because we love, we serve.

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:12.259
We serve each other.

00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:18.019
It's not so we can get something in return.

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:20.419
It's because we love.

00:31:20.419 --> 00:31:22.419
Amen?

00:31:22.419 --> 00:31:26.619
Verse number three, I love, therefore, I forgive.

00:31:26.619 --> 00:31:30.219
I love, therefore, I forgive.

00:31:30.219 --> 00:31:35.739
Notice in the book of Ephesians, I know I got you kind of going back and forth, Ephesians

00:31:35.739 --> 00:31:46.779
chapter number four, Ephesians chapter four and verse number two, just because we love

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:50.539
one another doesn't mean there's not going to be ever an occasion where we're going to

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:53.339
have to forgive.

00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:57.619
We love as families and there are times in which we offend one another and there's need

00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:00.419
for forgiveness.

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:05.659
As a church family, there'll be times in which somebody says something or does something

00:32:05.659 --> 00:32:10.539
and because we love one another, there's forgiveness.

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:16.779
In Ephesians four and verse number two, the Bible says this, with all lowliness and meekness,

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:22.459
with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love.

00:32:22.459 --> 00:32:28.379
And so we see this admonition at the front of the chapter, if you will, that we're to

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:35.259
have this humility and this patience, this long-suffering, forbearing one another in

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.499
love.

00:32:36.499 --> 00:32:43.219
And then we find that we come to verse 32 and the Bible says this, and be kind one to

00:32:43.219 --> 00:32:45.259
another, tender-hearted.

00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:49.779
Now tender-hearted doesn't necessarily mean love, but I believe that it communicates an

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:57.419
aspect of, because I love, I'm tender-hearted, there's some similarities or some impact there

00:32:57.419 --> 00:32:59.259
between those two things.

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:05.659
And then notice where it says, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath

00:33:05.659 --> 00:33:07.419
forgiven you.

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:11.899
The message tonight is not strictly on any of these particular thoughts of praying or

00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:17.539
serving or forgiving, but forgiveness is so necessary.

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:20.339
And because I love, I forgive.

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:23.019
The list is not exhaustive tonight.

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:28.259
It's a Wednesday evening, we have time for prayer, but the reality is that we see with

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:33.459
great clarity tonight that we ought to love one another.

00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:38.699
We see it in the New Testament, we see the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, all men

00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:44.259
are going to know you're my disciples as they see your love one for another.

00:33:44.259 --> 00:33:49.299
We see a church in Thessalonica that, man, if you visited that church and you saw, man,

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:52.619
this is a church where they love each other.

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:55.539
You went to the church at Corinth and said, man, this is a church where they're at each

00:33:55.539 --> 00:33:56.539
other's throat.

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:02.619
I mean, there's contentions and there's divisions and what is going on?

00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:03.819
What church do you want to join?

00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:06.699
What church do you want to be part of?

00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:15.579
I've been told from visitors from time to time of our church, they say something like

00:34:15.579 --> 00:34:19.239
this, your church is different.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.339
It seems like the people like each other.

00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:29.019
And so I'll take that as a compliment because we don't just like each other, we love each

00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:30.019
other.

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:37.339
But let me say this, as we look at this instruction, even as I mentioned from 1 Thessalonians 4

00:34:37.339 --> 00:34:44.500
verses 9 and 10, we cannot get content, we cannot get comfortable, we must understand

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:52.259
that though we do it, we're not perfect at it, but we must increase more and more.

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:57.019
So that it might be said as it was of the church in Thessalonica in 2 Thessalonians

00:34:58.019 --> 00:35:03.299
1, as I mentioned by way of introduction, that the charity of every one of you all toward

00:35:03.299 --> 00:35:06.659
each other aboundeth.

00:35:06.659 --> 00:35:11.699
I love the way that it's worded in 2 Thessalonians 1.3 because it wasn't just that there were

00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:15.339
certain cliques within the church that loved each other.

00:35:15.339 --> 00:35:21.939
No doubt many of us have been part of a church or we've been aware of or associated with

00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:27.219
some type of situation where, oh, there's cliques of people that love each other.

00:35:27.219 --> 00:35:37.299
But here the Bible says that the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.

00:35:37.299 --> 00:35:41.459
It's not just necessarily that, oh, I connect well with that person and I'm going to, no,

00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:44.379
it's we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:35:44.379 --> 00:35:50.059
And so the admonition this evening is that we would increase more and more that we ought

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:52.539
to love one another.

00:35:52.539 --> 00:35:53.539
Let's pray together.

00:35:53.539 --> 00:35:54.539
Father, we love you.

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:55.779
We thank you for loving us.

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.939
Thank you for being so gracious to us.

00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:00.500
Thank you for giving us your word.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:07.659
And I pray that as we understand that we're to love in deed and in truth, not simply in

00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:17.299
word, Lord, that you would enable us through your Holy Spirit which indwells us to love

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:22.659
one another, to love as you love, to love as we ought to.

00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:24.779
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:36:24.779 --> 00:36:28.179
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:29.179
Amen.

00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:30.179
All right.

00:36:30.179 --> 00:36:31.179
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin?

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:31.739
You did not receive.
