1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
hope that God has spoken to you and you've been encouraged as well. Take your Bible if

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,960
you will and turn with me to Acts chapter 13. Acts chapter 13. And I'm going to do something

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:24,120
a little different than I normally do tonight. I usually read a scripture, pray and preach.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,600
But tonight I'm going to pray and read some select scripture in Acts chapter 13 and then

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,599
preach. So let's pray and ask God to help us in this time together. Lord I am so thankful

6
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:46,200
for being here at Fellowship Baptist Church. I'm thankful for the fellowship that I've

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,159
been ever able to have with Pastor and his family and with those that I have been able

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:58,439
to see. Lord I am so grateful for the faithfulness of your people as they tune in to live stream.

9
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:05,800
I know it's not the easiest thing to do and I am just grateful that they love you, love

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,519
your word and care about pleasing you with their time but also learning something that

11
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,239
can help them please you with their lives. So Lord we ask you to continue to work and

12
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,639
we pray tonight that your Holy Spirit would just take your word and apply it to our hearts

13
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:32,160
in the ways that we need it applied and may we be people who are ready to hear and Lord

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:41,199
ready to submit to what you teach us. I pray for you to speak to us so that we can be helped

15
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:49,120
in our service to you. I ask it in Jesus name. Amen. I want to read four verses out

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:59,239
of chapter 13. I want to begin with verse 22. Note it. And when he had removed him,

17
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:09,119
he raised up unto them David to be their king. To whom also he gave testimony and said, I

18
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:18,279
have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill

19
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:27,839
all my will. Normally when I read that verse I am arrested, I stop and contemplate that

20
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:35,399
phrase a man after mine own heart. God doesn't say that about anybody else in the word of

21
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:42,160
God, but he says it about David. And I think it's significant and I won't hazard to this

22
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,880
sermon say what I think that means because I don't want to take the time, but what an

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,440
honor for God to look at your life and say that's a man who has my heart. He's after

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,320
mine own heart. But tonight the emphasis that I see in that verse is not on that phrase

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:12,080
after mine own heart. My emphasis is on the last words of that verse, which shall fulfill

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:20,960
all my will. I don't know that there would be any higher accolade that I would try and

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,360
achieve than from the day I got saved back in 1975 until the day that God decides that

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,119
he is going to take me home, that God could look at the life of Mike Edwards and say he

29
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:44,919
fulfilled everything I gave him to do. David's course was not an easy course and it was an

30
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:52,160
unusual life, but David was careful even though he was a flawed man. And we're all flawed

31
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:59,279
people. But the marvelous thing is that a man, even though he is flawed and even though

32
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:06,639
he falls with God's grace and help, he can get back up and complete the course that God

33
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:19,359
has for him. I notice a second man. Look at verse 25. And as John, notice this word, fulfilled

34
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:28,119
his course. He said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But behold, there cometh one after

35
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:36,440
me whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to lose. The second time, the second man, God says

36
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,640
about John the Baptist, he fulfilled his course. Boy, I would suggest to you tonight that the

37
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,720
course of John's life was certainly no easy course. He was a hard man, a man who lived

38
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,559
in the wilderness much of his life, a man who did not have the dainties, the luxuries

39
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:08,839
that others had in life, not in dress, not in food, not in housing. He was a rough man.

40
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:16,160
And I'd also remind us that the end of John's life was not a sweet time gathered around

41
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,720
his family, but John lost his head at the request of a pagan and wicked woman, and a

42
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,600
wicked king gave her her desire, and he was beheaded for his testimony for Jesus Christ

43
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:40,920
and for righteousness. And yet God looks at that man and says, he fulfilled his course.

44
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:50,559
There's a third man that's mentioned in this passage. Look at verse 29. And when they had,

45
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:58,239
here it is again, fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and

46
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:05,679
him in a sepulcher, but God raised him from the dead. Well, we know who we're talking about,

47
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:11,920
though his name is not used in verses 29 and 30. We're talking about the Lord Jesus Christ.

48
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,160
And though the Bible says here that they fulfilled all that was written of him,

49
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:29,079
understand this, Jesus did not have his life taken, he laid down his life for all of us.

50
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,920
And any time he would have wanted to come off the cross or stop the process,

51
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,720
he could have but called to his Father or called 10,000 angels, and legions of angels

52
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:49,000
would have come to his aid. No, he fulfilled the hardest course that any man has fulfilled

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,239
in this life. He died for those who did not love him. He died for those who were sinners when he

54
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:07,839
never one time in his 33 years sinned. Oh, Jesus fulfilled the plan of redemption that had been set

55
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:15,239
from before the foundation of the world, and I stand here tonight a saved man, not because of

56
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:23,440
anything in my life that I have done or accomplished, but simply by the grace of the Lord

57
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,799
Jesus Christ. And that is true of you if you're saved tonight. And I thank God that Jesus fulfilled

58
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:41,760
all that was written of him. Now listen, we're not talking about David tonight because he was a king.

59
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,720
We're not talking about John Baptist tonight because he was the great and last of the Old

60
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,519
Testament prophets, and was the forerunner for Jesus Christ. We're not talking about Jesus

61
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:03,880
tonight because he was prophet and priest and king. I want you to understand what that word

62
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:15,920
fulfilled intimates in each of their lives. They fulfilled what someone else gave them to do. You

63
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:26,760
know what we call that? They were servants. They were servants. Look at verse 36. For David, after

64
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:34,919
he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, was laid unto his fathers,

65
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:44,559
and saw corruption. But he whom God raised again saw no corruption. I don't think I do damage to

66
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:52,440
the scripture if I say to you, what is said of David is true also of John. What is said of David

67
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:00,880
is true also of Jesus, that they served their own generation, not by their own will, not in their

68
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:11,200
own way, but by the will of God Almighty. They were servants of God. I don't think you'll ever

69
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,239
read the name of Mike Edwards in Who's Who. I don't even know if they have Who's Who anymore.

70
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:26,039
I don't think that you'll ever read my biography unless I write it for myself. Don't intend to do

71
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:34,000
that. I don't think I'll ever be a king. I know I will never be a king. I will never be a great

72
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,359
prophet. I struggle to be a coherent preacher. I don't think, I know I will never attain to the

73
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:53,520
level of Jesus Christ, prophet, priest, and king. But I'll tell you what I can do. I can be a

74
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,599
servant. I can be a servant.

75
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,799
that's what I want to talk about tonight and it's outlined my sermon is outlined

76
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:11,799
in verse 36 number one they served number two and I'm gonna skip to the end

77
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:19,119
they served by the will of God and number three they served by the will of

78
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:28,399
God their own generation thought number one they served I love the word that is

79
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:37,199
chosen to be translated served in that verse God had many choices that he could

80
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:42,799
have made the Holy Spirit could have put the word diakonos in there because

81
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,759
deacons are most certainly servant and though we may not hold the office we can

82
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,599
serve with the spirit of the deacon he could have put doulas in there Paul

83
00:10:53,599 --> 00:11:00,159
often referred to himself as a doulas a bondservant of the Lord Jesus Christ

84
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:06,279
that he owed Jesus so much that he bound his life to the life of the Lord and

85
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,319
served the Lord but he didn't choose diakonos he didn't choose doulas instead

86
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:17,039
he chose a word that if you were standing in the Greek market or the

87
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,159
Roman market and and you would have heard this word and someone referring to

88
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,839
someone else or to themselves as this word it would have turned heads I'm not

89
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,839
good or a Greek scholar but let me try to pronounce it it is the Greek word

90
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,799
hoop array hey oh hoop array hey oh that and seven dollars will get you a cup of

91
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:51,079
coffee at Starbucks but I love what it means it means literally to make

92
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:58,879
yourself an under rower you say what is an under rower pastor well I want you to

93
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,239
picture in your mind no doubt you've seen a picture of a Greek ship a Greek

94
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:09,559
galley or a Roman galley and most of them had a mast and they could be

95
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:17,479
powered by wind with a sail but a sail was not a trustworthy mode of power if

96
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:22,679
the wind wasn't blowing and if you were chasing someone running from one someone

97
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:29,559
or battling someone you needed a ready and steady mode of powering that ship

98
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,039
and so most of the time when you see those galleys you'll see one or two rows

99
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:42,679
of windows and out of that window you will see an oar and those great ships

100
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:51,959
were powered by those oars and those oars were manned not by the elite of

101
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,119
society not by the educated of society not by the Greek citizen not by the

102
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:07,639
Roman citizen they were manned by the lowest of slaves they were rode by those

103
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:15,079
who had nothing else to offer but a strong back strong arms and strong hands

104
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:23,039
and their sole duty in life was to row to the cadence of that Roman or Greek

105
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,039
officer as he beat the count on that drum and they rode and they rode and

106
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,959
they rode they had such little value in life that if they died at the oar and at

107
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,679
their seat their shackles were undone they were thrown overboard and a new

108
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:51,999
slave was put in their place I want you to get a hold of this David and John

109
00:13:51,999 --> 00:14:04,159
Baptist and Jesus Christ so you know who I am I'm Hooper a tail I'm an under

110
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:11,399
rower I'm here to serve I'm not here with self-will I'm not here with

111
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,039
self-interest I'm not living a life that is so self-focused I'm not self-aware I

112
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:26,839
am here to serve someone other than myself I want to tell you my great fear

113
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,239
for Christianity in our day is that that word serve has been replaced with the

114
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:42,639
word and the concept of self it's all about me I'll never forget the first

115
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,599
time I heard the term many many years ago a seeker Church and I was sitting in

116
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,159
my office with one of my staff members and I said man that sounds awesome I

117
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,639
think we ought to be a seeker Church because I thought what it meant was

118
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,559
we'll go seek the lost and my staff member said preacher that's not what it

119
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:05,799
means it means that whatever you as someone in the community are seeking

120
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:13,479
will provide it for you just come to our church we have people who hunt for

121
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:21,479
churches not on the basis of how can I serve but on the basis of what's in it

122
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:28,759
for me hey I want churches to meet the needs of people please don't think

123
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,479
that's what I'm saying I'm I'm not saying that you ought not to get

124
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:38,639
anything out of church but when the focus of our lives is what's in it for

125
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,919
me we do not have the Spirit of Jesus the Spirit of John or the Spirit of

126
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:51,959
David and all of our positive thinking in all of our self-esteem and our

127
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:59,919
self-affirmation in in all of our selfies just let that just let that sink

128
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,679
into your mind do you ever take selfies I take selfies I don't anymore you say

129
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,879
preacher you got convicted about him no but my arm is short and this is all I

130
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,199
ever had in my picture and I said I don't think I want to broadcast that to

131
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:21,999
the world social media it's about me it's about me it's about me it's about

132
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:29,959
me here's what Jesus said Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the

133
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,359
princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are

134
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:46,879
great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but

135
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:54,039
whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will

136
00:16:54,039 --> 00:17:02,559
be chief among you let him be your servant even as the Son of Man came not

137
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:11,479
to be ministered unto but to minister and give his life a ransom for many can

138
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:18,439
you imagine a church seminar founded on the principle hey gather we want you to

139
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,439
pay a registration fee because we want to teach you that you're nothing it

140
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,679
wouldn't be well attended would it but it is the model that Jesus left for us

141
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:41,599
more than that it is the model that Jesus lived in his life I never forget

142
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:48,999
when we in our starting our churches have been 40 years ago we had moved out

143
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:54,239
of the high school and we had purchased a very ramshackle the old building on a

144
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,079
couple of acres three acres and and we were trying to make it presentable and

145
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,119
my wife and I were in there painting and we had just hired an assistant part

146
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,559
time and he was in there painting with us and the phone rang and I had to go

147
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,879
down and take a phone call legitimate I had to deal with something about 20

148
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:17,839
minutes later I'm walking back down the hall towards the nursery that we were

149
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,719
painting and and I hear this conversation I hear this young assistant

150
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:31,559
say to my wife I didn't go to Bible college for years to paint walls he did

151
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,839
not have an appreciation of who he was talking to I heard her say back to him

152
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:47,839
no we got saved to do this who do we think we are can I remind us tonight

153
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:58,719
that we are under rollers we are servants we are saved to serve listen

154
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:03,639
David understood that being the king brought not only the privilege of the

155
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:10,799
office but the responsibility of service I think of how many years that man even

156
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,839
though he had been anointed to be king and God had taken his hand off of Saul

157
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:24,359
he humbled himself and served Saul you talk about tough to swallow serving a

158
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:31,119
guy whom you know you're replacing and he did it right and sweetly I think of

159
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,159
David understanding the need to serve the less fortunate men that couldn't

160
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,599
give back to him as he brought lame Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan to his

161
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,440
palace and set him at his table and gave him a perpetual place at his table

162
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,880
he understood the need to serve as God as he prepared materials for the temple

163
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,359
that God had told him no you can't build it I don't know about you but boy I

164
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,359
don't know about you but I don't know about you but I don't know about you

165
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,679
I'd have probably been upset about that and say,

166
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,759
well, okay, if I can't build it,

167
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,219
if I can't get the glory from it,

168
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:11,159
then let Solomon figure it out.

169
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,819
But you know what David did?

170
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,799
Because he had a servant's heart

171
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,839
and he knew he was an under rower,

172
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,439
David said, let me gather the materials,

173
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:22,599
let me get the plans drawn, let me get it figured out

174
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,439
and let me take it all to my son Solomon

175
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,599
and give it to him to be done.

176
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,759
And it's amazing to me today,

177
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,319
even though David did all of that,

178
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,799
it is called Solomon's Temple.

179
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,279
And David has no issue with that.

180
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,359
Because David had a servant's heart.

181
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,739
It wasn't all about him.

182
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:52,119
John the Baptist certainly understood servanthood.

183
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,719
As that powerful, dynamic man stood there and said,

184
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,799
he must increase, I must decrease.

185
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,359
What a powerful thought.

186
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:11,559
To know that you possess real ability,

187
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,279
to know that you have a great following,

188
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,079
to know that your name is well known

189
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,079
and to willingly say, I will be submissive to this one

190
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,479
and to this one whom I have prepared the way,

191
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,119
I will gladly allow him to surpass me.

192
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,279
What a man.

193
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,559
Look to Jesus and you know what you'll find?

194
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,759
You'll find him the king of glory with a towel

195
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,639
and a basin washing the feet of his disciples.

196
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,239
He's all, we call them disciples,

197
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,639
but can we just make a little bit of understanding

198
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,519
of who they are?

199
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,199
He's washing the feet of a man who will sell him for 30,

200
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:56,159
or has sold him for 30 pieces of silver.

201
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,799
He's washing the feet of a man who will deny him three times

202
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,679
when it comes down to it.

203
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,599
He's washing the feet of all of those

204
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,319
who when he is arrested will forsake him and run.

205
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,159
We sometimes get all upset with Thomas or Peter or Judas.

206
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,139
We do realize every one of them forsook him.

207
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,999
I don't know about you, but that night in the upper room,

208
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,079
I might have looked up in Peter's eyes and says,

209
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,839
you know, I'm not gonna wash the dirty feet of a denier.

210
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:34,039
I feel pretty sure I'd have struggled

211
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,639
with the feet of Judas.

212
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,319
And I'll tell you, I'd have come to John

213
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,279
and I'd have looked at John and said,

214
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,039
man, you laid your head on my chest.

215
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,039
You're known as the disciple of love and you're gonna run.

216
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:53,039
And yet he dutifully washed their feet,

217
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,839
gave what they needed.

218
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:01,199
My favorite parable, or one of them,

219
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:04,359
is that of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10.

220
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,759
And I won't belabor this, but there were three men,

221
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,999
there was a Jew who had been on business

222
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,919
or been to temple or whatever,

223
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,759
but he had been set upon by robbers

224
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,639
and he had been left in the ditch, ready to die,

225
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,719
bleeding, not gonna make it.

226
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:24,759
And the Bible tells us that three men came down that road.

227
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,459
The first man that came down that road was a priest.

228
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,539
If anybody should know the heart of compassion of God,

229
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,199
certainly it would be a priest

230
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:36,359
who had a course of duty in the temple.

231
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,399
He would understand the heart of God.

232
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,119
But the Bible says before he even came to the man,

233
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,239
he crossed to the other side of the road and walked on by.

234
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,839
Bible says the next man down the road was a Levite.

235
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,639
Hey, a man who studied the word, a man who led worship,

236
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,399
a man who knew who God was.

237
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,919
And the Bible says that when he saw the man,

238
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,479
he came over and looked upon him.

239
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,359
I see him in my mind, kneeling and looking

240
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,319
in that beaten, dying man saying, where's the preacher?

241
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,699
You see, it's always the preacher's job

242
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:17,339
to go down into the ditch and to serve in that humble way.

243
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,539
But the real point of the parable is,

244
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:23,979
it's every believer's job.

245
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:30,059
Because every believer is called to serve.

246
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,259
That Samaritan comes down the road.

247
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:35,459
If anybody should have a reason not to go down in that ditch

248
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,139
it is the Samaritan.

249
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,819
But the Bible teaches us that he got down off of his donkey,

250
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:44,979
went down into that ditch using his own resources,

251
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:47,739
bound up the wounds of that man, carried that man,

252
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,259
put him on his donkey, took him to the inn,

253
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:53,219
paid for his stay, and at the end of it,

254
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,279
God just asks us a simple question, who is his neighbor?

255
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:03,059
Oh, we want to be seen as believers and loving people

256
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,099
and serious in our walk for the Lord.

257
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:11,099
And we don't have a moment for a lost, bleeding generation.

258
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,179
The Bible college that I went to

259
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,179
outside the administration building

260
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:25,719
had this on a stone monument, this saying,

261
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:30,859
enter to learn, go forth to serve.

262
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:34,059
And I've walked past that a thousand times

263
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,379
and I've thought to myself, that's kind of a nice saying,

264
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm not quite sure what it is,

265
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,939
but enter to learn, go forth to serve.

266
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,859
And I'll tell you, the longer I've pastored,

267
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,039
I've understood it.

268
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,339
You know what we are these days?

269
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:50,139
We enter to learn, we enter to learn, we enter to learn.

270
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:51,099
Who put the coffee on?

271
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,179
Who's got the donuts?

272
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,699
Because we're having Bible study.

273
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:56,079
We enter to learn, we enter to learn.

274
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,859
We've got a meeting, oh, what a speaker.

275
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,379
We've got to, we enter to learn, we enter to learn,

276
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:02,839
we enter to learn.

277
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:09,459
And so rarely go forth to serve.

278
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,219
And sometimes we just have to ask ourselves,

279
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,719
is this the Christianity that Jesus intended?

280
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:24,379
That we know all about him,

281
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:29,259
and yet never get off of our donkey

282
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,659
and get down in the ditch

283
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:37,659
with a bleeding and lost generation and try to help them.

284
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,959
Not only did they serve, they served by the will of God.

285
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,079
Notice that with me.

286
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,299
I'll say this to you, the world has never been

287
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:49,899
greatly impressed with anyone doing the will of God.

288
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,979
If you're waiting for somebody to applaud you

289
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,299
and your neighbor, oh, look at that,

290
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,439
they're going to church on Tuesday night.

291
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,939
Aren't they awesome?

292
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,500
They look at you and think, what's wrong with them?

293
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:05,099
If they knew that you tithed and gave to missions,

294
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:07,299
they'd say, what in the world?

295
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,939
I'm just saying to you that the world

296
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:15,579
has never been impressed with anybody doing the will of God.

297
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,819
But can I suggest to you that the wisdom of man

298
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:21,539
is foolishness in the eyes of God?

299
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,939
And you and I ought to find the will of God

300
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:27,459
and do it regardless of what any man thinks.

301
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,939
Michael thought it was foolish that David danced

302
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:34,559
before the ark when the ark was brought into Jerusalem,

303
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,699
but it was a day of rejoicing in the will of God.

304
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,719
Judas thought it was absolutely silly and wasteful

305
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:47,119
for Jesus to be anointed with that expensive oil,

306
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,139
but it was the will of God.

307
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:53,139
Peter rebuked the Lord for saying he was going to suffer

308
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:58,139
and die upon the cross, but it was the will of God.

309
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:01,859
And I say to us tonight, let the world have its opinions.

310
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,059
Let formal Christendom have its opinions.

311
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,939
Our lives and our ministries are not based

312
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,219
on the approval of the world.

313
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,000
They are based on the commandments

314
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,179
and the ultimate approval of God

315
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,679
as God set forth how he wants us to live.

316
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,439
The world may scoff at preaching,

317
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,619
but preaching is still the will of God.

318
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,119
The Bible howls at the thought of holy living.

319
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,899
Why don't you do what all the rest of us do?

320
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:35,859
Well, because God's not pleased with some of those things.

321
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:37,700
Obey God.

322
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:41,959
World hates confrontational soul winning,

323
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,419
telling a man that he's a sinner,

324
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:46,619
telling a woman that she needs to know Jesus Christ.

325
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,940
The world hates that and in many places

326
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,679
tries to outlaw that, but it is the will of God.

327
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,700
The world may sneer at parents

328
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,179
who accept the God given responsibility

329
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,979
of training our own children, but it is the will of God.

330
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:09,099
And you and I have to make a fundamental decision

331
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:13,380
that I'm going to serve and I'm going to serve

332
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,479
not in a modern way, not in a way

333
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,500
that's acceptable to the world,

334
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,380
but in a way that is acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.

335
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,260
Now mark this.

336
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,419
When I come into this room and I'm on live stream

337
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,659
preaching at Fellowship Baptist Church,

338
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,219
I love the stuff I'm saying.

339
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,739
Hey, preaching is what God wants.

340
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:40,019
Soul winning is what we need to do.

341
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,219
Holy living is what we need to pursue.

342
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,659
And you know why I love to do it?

343
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,099
I love to get kind of wild with it

344
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:48,500
and I love preaching like that.

345
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,619
You know why?

346
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:52,380
Because most everybody agrees with me in here.

347
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:56,820
You know where I'm not near as excited about it?

348
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,500
Out there, where absolutely nobody.

349
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:11,899
wants to hear what I have to say. Can I remind you of something? Jesus came unto

350
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:21,280
his own and his own received him not and therefore Jesus decided not to go to the

351
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,860
cross, not to humble himself and decided to go back to heaven and let mankind

352
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:35,020
find him. That's not true is it? He was forsaken, he was denied, he was rejected

353
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:45,900
and he marched right on to the cross because, ready for this? He was an underroar.

354
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,700
Well I'm not going to tell somebody about Jesus because they they might

355
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:58,860
think less of me. Hey, how can you think less of an underroar? The question we

356
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:07,440
need to ask ourselves is, who do we think we are? Are we too good to follow in the

357
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:15,339
steps of our Savior? Are we too good when he emptied himself and made of himself

358
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:22,139
no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant and was obedient unto

359
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:35,860
death, even the death of the cross? Who do we think we are? Too good, too busy.

360
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:46,220
Friends, we're underroars and our calling in life is to, as our Master did not come

361
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:54,500
to be ministered to, but instead came to minister and give his life a ransom for

362
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:05,699
many. Let me speak finally, just a moment on this thought. Our generation, who did

363
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:11,380
you ever think you would live in a world like we live in? Can I be honest

364
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,100
with you? I hope you'll let me and not think less of me. Sometimes in my life I

365
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:23,860
just come to the place where I would like to take any money that I have and

366
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,619
go up in the deepest holler of West Virginia and buy a couple hundred acres

367
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:36,460
and at the opening of the holler just put a wall. I would take my wife and my

368
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,740
kids, I'd definitely take my dog, I would take my grandchildren, my children, both

369
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,539
of my friends, I've only got two, and I would close that wall off and I would

370
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:59,660
say, leave us alone. But you see, that life would indicate that I am self-interested,

371
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:07,580
self-serving, self-focused. That would mean I was the guy who didn't want to be

372
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,300
bothered with the bleeding man in the ditch and I was the guy who looked at

373
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:18,300
him and thought somebody should help him, but it can't be me, I can't do that.

374
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:29,380
No, we are called to engage with this generation. Can I be honest with you? The

375
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:37,059
behavior of this generation is repugnant to me. I don't know all the letters, but

376
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:44,979
LGBTQ, that's a lifestyle that I don't believe is consistent with the Word of God.

377
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:53,300
I don't understand all the drug use, I don't understand all the piercings, I don't understand

378
00:33:53,300 --> 00:34:01,699
all the tats, I don't understand, honestly, I don't understand how a legislature of men and

379
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:09,820
women can vote on a bill that allows a baby to be born and then slain in the delivery room,

380
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,740
and then when you sign the bill that allows that, an entire legislature stands and applauds. That's

381
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:33,059
repulsive. But they're ours. They're our generation. And somewhere, somehow, you and I

382
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:42,899
have to remember that God placed us here at this time and he knew all of those things, and yet he

383
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:56,179
says to us, serve by the will of God your generation. Sometimes it's so big that I don't

384
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:03,660
see how it can possibly be done, and it's so awful that I don't feel like I want to even be part of

385
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:13,260
it. I don't know how you win this world, I don't know how you win this city, I don't know how you

386
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:29,940
win this community, but I do know this. I know how to see a guy lying in a ditch and trying to help

387
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:38,739
him. I won't belabor this, but I guarantee you something. If I could draw a five-mile circle

388
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:45,500
around this church tonight, I could find some certain things. I guarantee you I could find a

389
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:56,500
man who was injured, perhaps, at work. I'm making this up. And for a time, the company was helping

390
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:02,459
him, and they were writing prescriptions for painkillers, and boy, he just really was hurting.

391
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:07,700
And then the doctor said, well, I can't write those prescriptions anymore, and the pain was still

392
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:16,700
there. And he started looking for those pills somewhere else. And you say, wow, he's really in

393
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,459
bad shape, and his family is suffering because of it. Boy, that's weak. I can't stand that kind of

394
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:28,660
person. I don't want to be around that kind of person. Hey, I guarantee you that man, he can't go

395
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:37,260
to his work, his boss, and say, man, I'm hooked. I'm stuck. What do I do? He'll be fired. But I do

396
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:48,779
know a group of people who know the answer for that man. It's not a simple answer, but the answer

397
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:58,899
is Jesus Christ. That guy you work with, that you know he's having trouble in his home, that kid that

398
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:07,459
you go to school with, and you know they're going down the wrong path. I'm saying to us, look, I

399
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:15,380
can't win a city. I can't win a nation. I can't win a world. But I can be a servant. I can be a

400
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:28,299
friend to a man or woman that God leads me by, who is lying in a ditch, bleeding and dying. But

401
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:37,059
we've become so self-interested, so self-focused, that we, like the priest, run by because we've

402
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:42,059
got to get to our job in the commute, you know, and because Saturday's our only day, you know,

403
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:49,140
and because, oh well, you know, I'm not good at that, you know. Hey, can I remind you that we

404
00:37:49,140 --> 00:38:00,940
are under rowers? Can I remind you that but by the grace of God, that's us? As a matter of fact,

405
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:13,059
some of us who are saved today, that was us. You know what I'm asking God to do tonight? To remind

406
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:22,140
us of who we are. To remind us that we are servants. And yes, we live in a horrendously

407
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:31,420
ugly generation. They save whales and kill babies. I get it. They have more sympathy for a puppy than

408
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:40,619
for a human being. But they are our generation. And God has placed us here for such a time as

409
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:50,859
this. And it is time that we stop building empires in our churches and stop looking for what pleases

410
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:59,460
me and what I like and why isn't someone serving me. Why, you forgot me, me, me, me, an under rower.

411
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:14,260
Nobody needs to coddle you. We're just under rowers. You there at livestream and you in this

412
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:21,820
room, here's what I'm asking God to do. In all the stages of our life and all the places of our life,

413
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:34,020
you and I have someone that we come in contact with that is a bleeding, dying person in a ditch.

414
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:41,859
We rush past them or we hope someone will help them. We hope someone will deal with them. I'm

415
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:55,219
asking God to lay a name on your heart. Not a city, not a nation, a name. Might be someone that

416
00:39:55,219 --> 00:40:01,260
you already know and God has spoken to your heart. Might be somebody you work with. It might be the

417
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,460
neighbor next door and you

418
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,660
know that lady is so unhappy, and you know that she's in distress, and you know

419
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:13,700
it. She doesn't know where to turn, but you know the answer. You know Jesus

420
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:21,620
Christ is the answer. But until we come to the place in our lives where we are

421
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:29,300
willing to fulfill what God has given us to do amongst this generation in which

422
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:36,180
he's placed us, we'll be the priest hurrying by. We'll be the Levite wishing

423
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:43,020
somebody would do something. We need to get down off our donkeys and get down in

424
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:50,060
the ditch and be the friend to that person, the servant to that person with

425
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:57,300
the ideal and hope of leading them to Jesus Christ. Would you pray with me?

426
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,660
Father, I pray that every head is bowed in this room, every head is bowed in

427
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:11,740
these homes, and Holy Spirit, I ask you to do something just now. Would you please,

428
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:20,300
in the quietness of this moment, would you lay a name on the heart of every

429
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:29,100
believer that is listening? Maybe a neighbor or a workmate, it may be someone

430
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,900
they go to school with, maybe someone that comes to church, maybe someone they

431
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,100
know from business, but God, would you speak to their heart and lay that name

432
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:48,020
on their heart? And in the next days and weeks to come, I pray that these folks

433
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,940
that you've laid the name on their heart will be intentional with you,

434
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,220
asking you, God, to help them. Well, I can't deliver the gospel. You can be a friend

435
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:07,340
and a help. You can show love to a person that desperately needs it. You can get

436
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:14,940
them to Jesus. And I pray that they would purpose in their hearts, Lord, if you'll

437
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:24,740
lay someone on my heart, I will minister to that person with the goal of leading

438
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:36,460
them to Jesus Christ. I know it's hard, but God, we are servants. Lord, I pray for

439
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,340
those who are under the sound of my voice that you didn't lay a name on

440
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:49,260
their heart. I ask them to do this. Will you, in this invitation, ask God to lay

441
00:42:49,260 --> 00:43:01,260
someone on your heart? Lord, help us. We curse the darkness, we're repulsed by the

442
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:10,300
sin of the world that surrounds us, and yet we so focus on ourselves that we

443
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:17,300
never reach a handout. We're never even convicted to tell somebody Jesus loves

444
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:24,940
them. We're never even moved to give them a track. Lord, break that selfishness in

445
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:32,700
our hearts tonight. Lay someone on our heart, and may we purpose to lead that

446
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:43,340
one to Jesus by serving, serving them. Help us, I pray, in Jesus' name. Amen.
