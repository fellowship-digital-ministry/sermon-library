00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Studying through this book here on Sunday mornings, I trust that you are being encouraged

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.760
and strengthened through this wonderful epistle, only five chapters, but great truth that God

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.920
gives us.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.039
And I'm so thankful that God desires to inform us.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.079
He does not want us to be ignorant.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:24.000
And we find that even as we've looked through the passages of Scripture and we've understood,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.459
and really last week coming to the first of that reference in which we see the word no

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:35.900
used repeatedly, and that God wants us to know that we belong to him and what a joy

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.060
and what a blessing.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.700
I'm thankful for the security that we have in Christ.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.500
And last week I preached a message that I entitled from verse number six, walk as he

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
walked.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.099
And we noted the contrast in behavior between the saved and the lost.

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:58.340
And we understand that the commandments plural were in view within those verses of Scripture

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.200
in verse three down through verse number six.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.459
And we spoke about that internal work that God is doing in the life of his people, in

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:12.699
the life of his children, and how that internal work is evidenced on the outside, the external

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:16.739
evidence of the work that Christ is doing on the inside.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:23.379
This morning in verses seven down through verse number 11, we see that the apostle John

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:29.220
turns to a single commandment in a single subject matter that is of significant importance.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.099
I've titled the message this morning, love one another.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.580
And really we see that the subject in this portion of Scripture is that of brotherly

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.580
love.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.819
In fact, it is something that will be repeated throughout this epistle.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.220
We find that John will refer to the people as beloved.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.540
We find that he speaks about the love of God.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.860
And I'm so thankful for God's love.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.300
And I'm so thankful that we know that even as this book tells us we love him, Christ,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.300
why?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.300
Because he first loved us.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.019
And we understand that.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:05.500
And we find that he gives us much instruction with regard to loving our brethren.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.220
We understand just as we kind of review quickly in verses three through six from last week

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.300
that we mentioned there was a test that was given.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.740
Remember in verse number three it says, and hereby we do know that we know him, notice

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.020
if we keep his commandments.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.820
And we said that the test that was given would reveal that we know him.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.660
And he wants us to know that we know him.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.320
He wants us to be secure in our relationship with him.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
And what a blessing.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.699
And we find that he said in verse number six, he that saith he abideth in him, himself also

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.300
so to walk even as he walked.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.059
And what a blessing to know that we're saved.

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.339
It's a terrible thing to go through life and not knowing from moment to moment, day

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.979
by day, whether we're truly saved or not, thinking that it's dependent upon something

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.460
that we did or we could do.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.619
We understand as we've mentioned last week that no one's ever been saved, no one will

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.580
ever be saved by keeping his commandments.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.020
But we find that he says that we know that we know him if we keep his commandments.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.460
Jesus said this, he said, if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.660
And we'll see that that will resurface itself again in chapter number five of this short

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.660
epistle.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.979
Jesus said that in the gospel of John.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:32.339
So we find that that was the test and that's what we were able to discover last week.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.380
This week, however, we find that the test is slightly different.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.860
The test that is given to us this week, the results of the test in this portion of scripture

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.119
will determine whether we are walking in the light.

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.639
And remember our theme for this year, we have it on the banners, we've passed it out, made

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.839
it available on a whole host of things, sermon notebooks and calendar and our bookmarks and

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.639
what have you, walking in the light.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.880
And here's the reality, anyone can say whatever they want to say, right?

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.440
We noticed that last week, he that saith I know him in verse number four.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.320
We found it in chapter number one multiple times when we say, if we say, here in this

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.079
portion of scripture in verse number nine, he that saith he is in the light, and it's

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.160
easy to say anything.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.600
We're to walk in the light.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.200
Remember verse number seven of chapter one, if we walk in the light as he is in the light,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.679
and we'll look at the rest of that verse in just a moment.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.179
But really, how do I know if I'm walking in the light?

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:40.279
We said that walking in the light would be synonymous with being with walking in the

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:46.519
spirit, walking in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ, walking in fellowship with the Lord

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:52.279
Jesus Christ, for we know that he is light, according to 1 John 1 and verse number five.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.920
According to John chapter number one, he is light.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.779
In him is no darkness at all.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.959
And so if I walk in the light as he is in the light, and if I say that I'm walking in

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:11.239
the light, is there some test, is there some way to be able to examine and determine, am

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:12.519
I walking in the light?

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:18.040
Well, this morning we see the first of these tests that are given in our portion of scripture.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.799
It's been quite evident as we've looked at this short book, the book of 1 John, that

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:24.480
we can say whatever we want.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.359
I mentioned that a moment ago, but if we walk in the light, we remember from our previous

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:36.480
study in 1 John 1 and verse number seven, it says that we have fellowship one with another.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.320
I made point of dealing with that subject because often when we think about walking

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.559
in the light, we think about our fellowship that we have with God.

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.959
And certainly that is true.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.720
We're walking in the light as he is in the light, we're having fellowship with God.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.920
But the emphasis placed in verse number seven of 1 John 1 is that if we walk in the light

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.119
as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:05.640
In the blood of Jesus Christ, his son cleanseth us from all sin.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.160
And the fellowship that we have on Wednesday evening, our prayer bulletin, one of the things

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.559
that we thank the Lord for was fellowship.

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.239
And I'm so thankful for the privilege of fellowship with our brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:17.239
And what a blessing.

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.760
And as we walk in the light, we were told, we were reminded that we'll have fellowship

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.920
one with another.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.880
But I want you to notice in verse number 10 of 1 John chapter number two, and really

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.260
the portion that we're looking at this morning, the Bible says this, he that loveth his brother

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:40.119
abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.640
And so we find that in verse number 10 of 1 John chapter number two, we are given, we

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.640
are provided by God an external evidence of what it is to walk in the light.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:55.839
If I love my brother, then it says that I'm abiding in the light.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:00.559
Remember we said in verse number six, he that saith he abideth in me ought also, or ought

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.160
himself also, so to walk even as he walked.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.720
That word abide is, of course, the Lord used that in John chapter number 15 in speaking

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.519
of the importance of abiding in him.

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:17.799
And here, John tells us, if we want to know that we're walking in the light, that one

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:23.399
test that we can give ourselves, one way of confirming that we're walking in the light

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:28.880
is not just by what we say, but how we love.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880
How we love.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.320
See, in verse number nine, the Bible says, he that saith he is in the light, he that

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.880
saith, right, you can say whatever you want to say, he that saith that he is in the light,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.359
that he that hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.

00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:55.399
So we find that this one professes that he's walking in the light.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:08:00.760
We find that the admonition was given that we're to walk as he walked in verse number

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
six.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.000
We find that he says that we're to walk in the light in verse number seven of chapter

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.200
number one, and there are some that will say, I'm walking in the light.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.920
But John says, if you say that you walk in the light, but you hate your brother, that

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.679
in fact, you're in darkness.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.320
Notice in verse number nine, we mentioned a moment ago, it says, excuse me, verse number

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.320
11, it carries on with verse number nine, but he that hateth his brother is in darkness,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.080
and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.479
his eyes.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:38.039
And so we see in verse nine, this one says that he's walking in the light, but he hates

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.919
his brother, and the one that hates his brother, he's not walking in the light as Christ is

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.280
walking in the light.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.159
He's walking in darkness.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:53.640
But verse number 10, the contrast that is provided here, it says this, he that loveth

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:01.359
his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.

00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:05.960
As we look at this portion of Scripture, it's interesting as it kind of goes back to verse

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.479
number seven, and where we'll start looking and kind of digging through this morning,

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:16.479
I want you to notice how John approaches this subject of love one another.

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:22.520
In verse number seven, he says, brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.119
old commandment, which ye had from the beginning.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:30.559
The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:35.200
He says this in verse eight, again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:42.359
is true in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:47.760
As we look at verses seven and eight, there could be at surface level a contradiction,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.320
a level of confusion, because he says, I write no new commandment in verse number seven,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.960
but in verse number eight, he says, again, a new commandment I write unto you, and you

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
say, well, what is it?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960
Is it an old commandment?

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
Is it a new commandment?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.960


00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.720
it, John, that you're trying to convey to us? We know that all Scripture is given by

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.280
inspiration of God, and it's profitable, and there's no confusion here. In fact, as you

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.240
look at the portion of Scripture, what John is referring to in verse number 7, when he

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.360
speaks of that old commandment, is the reality that these people and the people of God, as

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.880
you study the Word of God, you would have known from the Pentateuch that we're to love

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:30.120
one another. The truth of loving one another is given to us in the book of Leviticus. In

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.800
fact, in Leviticus 19, in verse number 18, it says that thou shalt love thy neighbor

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.040
as thyself. In verse number 34, it's speaking about the strangers that would be among them,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.000
and it says thou shalt love him as thyself. And so this commandment that he's referring

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.580
to, this old aspect in verse number 7 that they would have had from the beginning, it's

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.660
in the Pentateuch. It's a known truth that you're to love one another, but we find that

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.980
the newness of the commandment is given to us in verse number 8, and we must remember

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:10.380
that John the Apostle was with the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter 13. And as he's there

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.180
with Jesus in John chapter number 13, in verse number 34, and we'll look at the passage a

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:22.060
little bit later this morning, but we find that Jesus says this, a new commandment, a

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.820
new commandment I give unto you. What was that commandment that Jesus gave? That you

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.820
love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another. So what was the

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.620
shift? What was the newness of this commandment? It was no longer that you're to love your

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:48.620
neighbor as yourself, but now we have the responsibility to love one another in the

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.980
manner in which Jesus loved. He says a new commandment I give you, that you love one

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.980
another as I have loved you, that you also love one another. And so we find in verse

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.820
7, in verse number 8, there's no contradiction. The Lord Jesus Christ, as He walks upon the

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.980
face of the earth during His earthly ministry, He demonstrated a level of love that had not

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.940
been known to those people up to that point. The agape love of the Lord Jesus Christ, of

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.220
God Almighty, and it's on full display in the people that Jesus interacted with. They

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:33.220
had never seen love in this way. They had never experienced love in this manner. The

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.740
Bible tells us that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:44.940
believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And as Jesus Christ, God

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.300
is love, this book tells us this, the book of 1 John, and we find that God is love, and

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:57.300
as He walked upon the face of the earth, they had the privilege of seeing love manifested.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.780
And it was different than anything they had ever experienced. You know, it's interesting

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.020
as you look at the Sermon on the Mount, we don't have time this morning to deal with

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.900
that, but you'll find that even contained within that portion of Scripture, He says,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.980
you have heard to love your neighbor and to hate your enemies. But I say unto you, love

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:22.980
your enemies. Do good to them that hate you. Man, that's just turn your world upside down.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:31.580
Jesus, He begins to deal with the heart, right? Out of the abundance of the heart, we find

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.940
that Proverbs 4 tells us to keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.940
issues of life. And we find that Jesus begins to deal with the heart. He says, you understand

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.180
the commandment that you're not to commit adultery. And then He says this, but if you

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.780
think on a woman to commit adultery with her, you've already done it. Oh man, all of a sudden,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.180
again, the change that Jesus is bringing, and the way in which He's peeling back the

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:06.460
truth of Scripture. And with this particular subject matter of love, that's why John's

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:13.300
using this phraseology of a new commandment. It's the same thing you heard Jesus say. A

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.580
new commandment I give you, that you love one another. Man, we know that. No, no. But

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.980
as I have loved you. Notice as we look at this portion of Scripture and think of this

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.940
subject matter of love one another, I want you to consider the truth imparted. The truth

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.980
imparted. What a great truth it is. Go back to the book of John. I've referenced already

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:40.580
John 13 and verse number 34 a few times, where the Bible says, as we've mentioned here in

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.700
this point, that Jesus said, a new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.780
as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. But look over in chapter number 15,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.660
if you will, of the gospel of John. John chapter number 15. Look down at verse number

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:02.500
12. In John 15 and verse number 12, again, John, the apostle, would have been here and

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.060
would have been hearing, receiving these words from Jesus Christ on the eve of Him going

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:14.220
to the cross of Calvary. The greatest demonstration of the love of God Almighty was when He went

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:20.780
to that cruel cross for your sin and for my sin. And we find on the eve of that that Jesus

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:27.100
is telling His disciples, love as I have loved. In John 15 and verse number 12, this

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:34.500
is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you. Look at verse number

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.700
17. These things I command you, that ye love one another. We find that the church in Ephesus

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.340
has given the encouragement in Ephesians 5 and verse number 2 with regard to this matter

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.220
of love. We find that the churches that are being written to are encouraged with this

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:57.260
subject matter of loving one another and we find it in Ephesians 5 and verse number 2.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.940
The apostle Paul, as he's ministering to these believers in Ephesus, he's encouraged them

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:10.520
and he's helped them to identify how they are to walk because of their position in Christ.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.460
The position that they have as being saved people is established in the first three chapters

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:22.260
of the book of Ephesians and now the outflow, the outworking, the external evidence, our

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.780
walk is being dealt with in chapters 4 through 6 and notice in Ephesians 5 and verse number

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:37.980
2, and walk in love. How? As Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:45.180
offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Aren't you thankful that

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:52.220
he did that? When he went to that cruel cross and Paul encourages these believers in Ephesus

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:58.520
and he says, walk in love as Christ also hath loved us. Remember it's in this same portion

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:05.060
of scripture in Ephesians 5 that the instruction is given to the husbands in verse number 25

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:12.540
of Ephesians 5. Husbands, love your wives. How? Even as Christ also loved the church

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:21.220
and gave himself for it. Wow. We find that the believers in Thessalonica, what a great

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.700
church. 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, look there if you will. What a great church

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:32.940
this is and God allowed the apostle Paul to be used from a human perspective to see this

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:39.180
church established and he commends them in both the first chapter of the first epistle

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.820
and the first chapter of the second epistle with regard to their walk and their behavior

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.580
and their growth. There's a good church, a model church. And I want you to notice what

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:56.300
is said in 1 Thessalonians 4 in verse number 9. He says this, but as touching brotherly

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.260
love ye need not that I write unto you. Notice this, for ye yourselves are taught of God

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:07.220
to love one another. He's reminding them of this truth. Notice what he says in verse

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:13.100
number 10, and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.420
They were loving one another as they had been commanded to. But Paul continues and says,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:27.980
but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more. Wow. Increase in your love

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:34.980
one for another. We find that this truth is given by Peter. Notice in 1 Peter chapter

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:42.300
1 as you look in this great letter and understand the difficulties in which these people that

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.940
are scattered abroad, the persecution in which they're dealing with and the turmoil in which

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:57.059
they're facing. And we find that Peter will deal with the subject matter of love, of charity.

00:18:57.059 --> 00:19:02.900
In 1 Peter chapter 1 in verse number 22, notice the Bible says, seeing ye have purified your

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:10.100
souls and obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:18.780
that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. Wow. He says that it's, notice

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:26.540
how it's described, unfeigned love of the brethren. He says that it's to be a love one

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:33.500
for another that's with a pure heart fervently. We're told in the book of Romans that love

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:41.580
is to be without dissimulation, without pretense. It's to be pure. We find that in 1 Peter 4,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:49.260
turn over just a page or two and see in verse number 8, Peter dealing with the subject matter

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:55.559
of love, of charity. He says, above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.920
charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.500
Fervent charity.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.040
It's interesting, for he said,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.400
remember there in v. 22 of the first chapter,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.360
with a pure heart fervently.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.720
And then he says have fervent charity.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.260
And what a blessing to think about

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.160
the admonition, the instruction,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.780
and we see the truth that's being imparted.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.660
We find it here in the book of 1 John

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.060
that we're studying this year.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.820
And we find it in this first chapter

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.300
that John says, listen,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.740
we're to walk in the light.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.160
We're to walk as He walked.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.380
And I want you to understand

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.080
that you can take this self-test.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.280
You can examine yourself to determine

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.920
am I walking in the light

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.020
as He is in the light?

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.980
Well, how's your love for one another?

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.360
Because if you say that you walk in the light,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.800
but you hate your brother,

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.840
you're actually walking in darkness.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.040
And so this truth is imparted

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.380
to the people of God.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.840
I want you to consider this,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840
number two this morning,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.440
the truth illustrated.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.220
The truth illustrated.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.020
As we think about the love

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.600
and the truth of loving one another

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.180
and understanding that we're to love

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.220
as Jesus loved,

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.900
who better to illustrate this truth

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.340
than Jesus Himself?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.400
When you think about the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.400
when you think about His earthly ministry,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.160
when you think about how He went about

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.320
and all that He did,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.860
the interactions that He had,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.220
you can see His love on display.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.840
You can see that He's loving individuals.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.080
I want you to consider in John 13,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.600
we looked already at the end of the chapter

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.820
when He's speaking to His disciples.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.200
But before that, we find that in John 13

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.700
in verse 1,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.600
the Bible gives us some insight

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.780
and it's a phraseology that I think

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.000
is of significant importance to us

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.540
when we think about the love

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.740
that is illustrated,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.500
the truth of loving one another

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.060
that is illustrated in the life

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.620
of our wonderful Savior,

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.840
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.700
In John 13 and verse 1,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.540
the Bible says,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.760
now before the feast of the Passover,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.220
when Jesus knew that His hour was come,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.820
that He should depart out of this world

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.960
unto the Father,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.440
He's speaking about the cross.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.280
Notice where it says,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.320
having loved His own which were in the world,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.640
notice this phrase,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.940
He loved them unto the end.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.000
He loved them unto the end.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.820
There are some things that they did.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.820
Peter denied the Lord, did he not?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.880
Jesus told him that He would deny Him.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.080
And after Peter heard that cock crow,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.280
he looked at Jesus

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.520
and Jesus was looking at him

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.020
and the Bible says that He wept bitterly.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.760
I think it was a look of love.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.120
Peter, do you love me?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.200
John 21, right?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.300
Jesus loved Peter.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.140
Jesus loved unto the end.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.180
I think about this.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.180
You don't need to turn there,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.760
but in Matthew 26,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.720
the record is given to us

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.380
with regard to the Lord in the garden

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.460
and all that takes place.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.820
And you'll know that He was of course sold.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.700
He was sold for just some pieces of silver

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.500
and Judas betrayed Him, right?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.660
And we understand that when Judas enters in,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.540
Judas knew where He would be.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.000
It was a place that Jesus had often resorted,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.180
the Bible tells us.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.780
And as Judas goes in there,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.240
it's so interesting to me

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.280
that in Matthew 26 and verse 50,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.880
that Jesus calls His betrayer,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.520
friend.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.480
Friend.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.800
Friend.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.000
The one that would give Him a kiss of betrayal.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.360
Friend.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.840
Jesus on the cross of Calvary

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.620
after He'd been betrayed by Judas,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.820
after He had stood before Pilate

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.380
and all that had taken place,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.460
and after the crowd cries out,

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.820
crucify Him! Crucify Him!

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.600
Jesus goes to that cruel cross.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.000
There's love that kept Him there.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.380
There's many last sayings of Christ 7

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.880
if you look at all of the Gospels

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.140
and examine them.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.680
But this one in Luke 27 and verse 34,

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.620
Jesus says,

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.020
Father, forgive them,

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.440
for they know not what they do.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.020
Isn't that not a great illustration

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.460
of this love that we're speaking of this morning?

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.460
Love leads to forgiveness.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.220
Peter said that we're to have fervent charity.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.960
Above all things, have fervent charity

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.840
among one another, amongst yourselves.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.760
Why?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.720
For charity covereth the multitude of sins.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.020
And we find here that Jesus,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.240
He said, Father, forgive them,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.120
for they know not what they do.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.460
Paul speaks about how He loved the brethren.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.460
He said, the more I love, the less I be loved.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.600
Paul wrote to the church in Corinth

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.200
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.160
1 Corinthians 13.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.160
We know it as being what?

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.520
1 Corinthians 13 is?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.600
Come on, you guys asleep or what?

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.520
The love chapter.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.340
So many people refer to it as being the love chapter, right?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.500
Charity, charity, charity, charity.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.460
All of the description that's given to us

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.900
with regard to charity.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.660
And if you have all of these things

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.140
and you do all of this stuff,

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.700
but you have not charity,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.900
profiteth nothing, right?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.340
Think about the context of who's being written to

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.420
in 1 Corinthians 13.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.640
A church that had all kinds of problems, right?

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.180
The church in Corinth is known for its envyings

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.300
and its divisions,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.540
and it's known for its carnality.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.620
In fact, they're told,

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.540
I cannot write unto you as being spiritual.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.980
You can't handle it.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.700
You're carnal.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.940
There's divisions among you.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.180
It's not the way that God intended it to be.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.260
Jesus said, love one another as I loved you.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.040
We find that Paul is writing to those believers

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.980
and lifting up charity.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.020
Remember, these folks in Corinth,

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.940
they're in all kinds of division.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.860
Really, one of the main sources of division for them

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.940
that's really being dealt with

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.780
in that portion of 1 Corinthians

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.740
is that of spiritual gifts.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.740
Look at the gift that I have.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.440
My gift is better than your gift.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.100
Paul says, let me just remind you

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.340
that the gift that you have was given to you.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.380
Amen?

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.420
It was given to you by God,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.780
and it was given to you for His glory,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.000
not for your glory.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.640
Amen?

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.440
And he talks about charity, love,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.320
the illustration of this truth,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.980
I believe, as I mentioned already,

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.580
the greatest illustration is that of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.440
We're familiar with the truth of Romans 5,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.000
in verse number eight,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.100
but God commendeth His love toward us,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.440
that while we were yet sinners,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.080
Christ died for us.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.680
The question is asked in the book of Romans,

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.760
what can separate me from the love of God?

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.920
What's the answer?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.560
Nothing.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.760
Nothing can separate you from the love of God.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.480
Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.200
When you think about the truth illustrated,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.400
we, though, have the responsibility to love as Christ loved.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.800
We have that responsibility.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.240
We're given that truth in the Word of God,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.880
and I find that it's illustrated beautifully by Steve

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.060
in Acts chapter number seven.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.300
In Acts chapter number seven,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.220
we find that the truth is given to us of this man, Stephen,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.340
and his great sermon, and he's preaching,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.800
and what a great message he preaches.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.900
We don't have the time to deal with the sermon of Stephen,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.460
but we know if we went back to the sixth chapter

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.280
of the book of Acts,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.820
that they were choosing out their co-laborers,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.540
the deacons, as we'd often refer to them as,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.580
that are selected here,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.960
and they had been given some criteria.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.140
They were to find men,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.940
according to verse number three of Acts six,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.700
that were brethren, and look among you,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.520
seven men of honest report,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.580
full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.020
whom we may appoint over this business,

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.900
and they select these individuals,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.860
and we find that Stephen becomes really the focal point

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.380
here at the end of chapter number six

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.280
and in chapter number seven.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.100
And as Stephen is preaching,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.420
and again, what a great message he preaches,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.240
if you read through the message of Acts chapter number seven,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.880
you see that he's a man that knew the word of God.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.120
He was a man that understood,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.600
that was filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.040
and he preached with great power.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.440
And the preaching of Stephen

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.500
led to great levels of conviction

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.240
to those that were hearing this message.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.680
The Bible tells us that he was full of the Holy Ghost

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.800
in verse number 55, and he's preaching there,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800
and he looks up steadfastly into heaven.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.040
He saw the glory of God and Jesus

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.380
standing on the right hand of God.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.260
And he said, behold, I see the heavens open

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.860
and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.060
Then they cried out with a loud voice

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.060
and stopped their ears and ran upon Him with one accord,

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.340
cast Him out of the city and stoned Him.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.900
The witnesses laid down their clothes

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.980
at the young man's feet whose name was Saul.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.340
They stoned Stephen.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.660
Notice it says, calling upon God and saying,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.580
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.480
But I want you to notice in verse 60,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.400
and he, Stephen, he kneeled down.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.240
He cried with a loud voice,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.240
Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.000
And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.200
What did Jesus say in Luke 27?

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.360
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.120
And Stephen, as he's taking that final breath,

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.400
He says, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.680
That's a great level of love.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.680
Not for our brothers that we're speaking of contextually,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.680
but for the ones that we're stoning him.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.760
Amazing.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.160
We think about the context of loving the brethren,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.920
love one another.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.960
Oh, how we ought to implement this truth that

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.840
leads us to our final point this morning,

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.160
the truth implemented.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.840
How is it that I can love as I've been commanded to love?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.920
How is it that I can have this walk in the light

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.360
as he is in the light, as he says in 1 John 1,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.600
in verse number 7, as he says in chapter 2 in verse number 10,

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.000
that if I love, the truth is given the examination.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.880
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.560
How can I abide in the light?

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.920
How can I through examination and see that evidence

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.320
that I love the brethren, that I love as Christ loved,

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.560
how can I do that?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.480
Can only do it through the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.960
It's only through the power of God

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.960
that we can love as Christ loved.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.600
Notice in Romans 5 and verse number 5,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.480
I know we're going to a number of portions of scripture

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.920
this morning.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.720
And I got a brand new Bible, so I'm trying to go slower.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360
I gave up my old Bible.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.760
I could kind of turn to places just by feeling.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.240
It was broken in, you know?

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.720
You got one of those things, whatever,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.000
it's an old sweater, a ball cap, a glove,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.400
and it just, man, it's just perfect.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.600
And then Julianna said, Daddy, can I have your Bible

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.800
when I go to college?

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.800
I was like, man, that's a hard request.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.080
Amen.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.360
And here we are with a brand new Bible,

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.840
but I'm thankful for it, amen.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.800
Romans 5, notice what the Bible says in verse number 5.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.280
And hope maketh not ashamed.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.960
Notice what it says.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.720
Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.000
How?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.160
By the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.560
The moment of salvation, the Bible

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.320
teaches us that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.280
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.960
He's the earnest of our salvation.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.200
We are sealed under the day of redemption.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.280
The proof, the evidence of our salvation

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.760
is the fact that the Holy Spirit of God indwells every believer.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.320
You can read in Ephesians 1, we understand

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.560
that 1 Corinthians 6 speaks about our bodies

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.640
being the temple of the Holy Ghost, which ye have of God.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.280
It's in you.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.320
You have of God.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.440
We're bought with a price.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.200
We're not our own.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.960
But we find that the Bible says here

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.320
that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.120
How?

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:51.240
By the Holy Ghost, which is in you, or which is given unto us.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.480
Remember the truth of the book of Galatians

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.200
in the fifth chapter when you consider

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.520
the fruit of the Spirit.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.160
You read in Galatians 5, in verse number 22,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.880
the fruit of the Spirit is what's the first one?

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.960
Love.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.000
The works of the flesh are manifested.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.920
He gives them in the preceding verses.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.840
There's no love there.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.800
Amen?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.160
Murders and envyings and all of the strife and the discord.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.080
But he says that the fruit of the Spirit

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.120
is love, joy, peace.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.000
And on and on.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
We see that love.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.880
It's through the Holy Spirit of God

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:33.600
who indwells us, that enables us to love as He loved.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.520
It's no longer love your neighbor as yourself.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.640
But it's now that we're to love one another as Christ loved.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.560
And He loved with a sacrificial love.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.920
He loved with an everlasting love, an unconditional love.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.760
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.680
I'm thankful that I'm in the love of God, that God loves me.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.880
But His love through us.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.160
We mentioned already the church of Thessalonica

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.120
in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 9 and 10.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.120
We read the verses a few moments ago.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.360
But the Bible says that Paul, when

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.320
he's speaking to them about this loving one another, he says,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.280
and you do it.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.960
You're actively following, obeying the command.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.840
You've implemented this truth.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.800
You're doing what you've been commanded to do.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.400
I would say it this way as I compare all of Scripture

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.840
with this subject matter that is before us this morning.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.160
The church in Thessalonica, they were walking in the light.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.840
Because they were loving the brethren.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.800
And that external evidence was proof

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.240
that they were walking in the light.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.280
We find that the apostle John, the one

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.920
that God used to write this particular book that

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.840
we're studying this year, 1 John,

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.680
he wasn't always a loving kind of guy.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.920
In Luke chapter 9, they got some enemies there.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.000
And he says, Lord, should we call down some fire

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.920
and consume these guys?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.040
Go back and read it, Luke 9, verse 51 through 56.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.120
What's he thinking about?

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.320
Well, you remember back in the Old Testament, right?

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.480
Elisha, they called fire from heaven.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.360
That third servant all of a sudden got a little bit wise

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.960
and came to Elisha in a little bit different approach.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.000
Because the other two groups that came with 50,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.440
they got consumed with fire.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.240
This is going to be my demise as well.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.560
And so I'm going to come a different way, right?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.000
And God tells Elisha, it's OK, go down with them.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.320
Second Kings 1, I believe, is where that's found.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.080
And you look and you see what's happening.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.520
And that's John.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.840
You guys know Abishai, David's Abishai?

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.760
Sometimes we kind of follow the personality of Abishai.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.800
You know what he says?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.360
David, let me just smite him one time.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.720
I'm not going to stab him twice with the sword, just once.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.360
That's what he says about Saul, right?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.080
No, no, no, no.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.680
We don't want that spirit, right?

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.600
And we find that John, he wasn't always the one

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.160
that we read here in 1 John.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.240
When he's using the term beloved,

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.520
when he's speaking about the subject of love.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.680
See, the Lord Jesus Christ changed his life.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.160
And he learned what it was to walk in the light.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.800
And he heard that command, that I'm to love as Christ loved.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.360
Now think about John.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.400
Who better from a human perspective

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.040
to write on the subject of love than John?

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.600
Than John.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.600
He refers to himself continually through the book of John

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.160
as being he whom the Lord lovest.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.960
He doesn't refer to himself as John.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.400
He knew and he had experienced the love.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.840
And it's now been implemented.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.920
There's truth in his life.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.920
The Holy Spirit of God that's within him

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.400
is enabling him to love.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.120
What a blessing to see the work of God.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.080
And as we walk in the light,

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.120
that this love for the brethren.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.440
Think about believers today.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.120
I've referenced already 1 Corinthians 13.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.280
We think about the truth being implemented

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.560
and the importance of love.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.440
Loving the brethren.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440
Romans 12.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.800
I mentioned this portion a little while ago as well

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.600
or this verse of Scripture.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.600
Look in Romans 12 and verse number nine.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.080
The Bible says,

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.520
let love be without dissimulation.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.480
Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.960
Our love is to be sincere.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.920
There's no pretense.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.160
I mentioned that earlier.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.640
That love that we have, it's God's love.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.160
But I can't do it in my flesh.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.840
See, walking in the flesh is the opposite

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.800
of walking in the light or walking in the Spirit.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.160
If we think about walking in the Spirit

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.560
as being walking in the light,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.720
then walking in the flesh is like walking in darkness.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.360
And we find that he's speaking here

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.760
not being in that darkness of not being saved,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.400
but looking at the loving our brothers

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.240
and the brethren and the importance

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.280
and understanding that his love comes through us

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.880
and we love one another.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.160
Listen, before I got saved,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.880
I didn't have any love for this book.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.720
I didn't have any love for God.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.640
I didn't have any love for church.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.600
I didn't have any love for God's people.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.240
Did you?

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.520
I didn't have love, but I got saved.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.880
And all of a sudden, you develop a love

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.760
for the Word of God.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.160
As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.520
that you may grow thereby.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.320
In a book that I never read in my life,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.560
all of a sudden, I have a desire to read it.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.960
A place that I never attended, a church,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.840
I have no desire to go.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.480
Now, all of a sudden, I don't want to miss it.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.960
I don't want to miss church.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.200
I want to be in church at every opportunity,

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.520
not just because I'm a pastor,

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.720
but long before I was a pastor.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.560
I want to be in church.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.720
I want to be where the brethren are.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.080
Amen?

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.200
And you love the brethren.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.720
I find it in my life,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.840
and I don't mean it to sound unkind.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.760
I don't mean it to sound inappropriate.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.880
And I think this morning that you could help

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.360
to identify with this,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.680
that after salvation,

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.880
we think about our brothers and sisters in Christ

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.720
and the love that we have one for another.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.480
It really exceeds even the physical relationships

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.360
that we have with family on this earth.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.840
You have lost family members,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.120
and there's a love for those lost family members,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.080
but there's something missing.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:06.080
You find people all over the world that profess their faith in Jesus Christ and you might just meet them and it's amazing the bond that you can have.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.080
Loving the brethren is something that God does in us.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:18.080
And as we walk in the light, it's going to happen that we love the brethren.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.080
But don't say that we walk in the light if we're hating the brethren.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.080
Because we've really just deceived ourselves.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080
Amen?

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:34.080
And as we look at this portion of Scripture in 1 John, and we consider this, I think about the trip I took a few years ago to Mexico,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:40.080
and I'm standing down there and we're distributing literature and we're trying to reach people, but I don't speak Spanish.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.080
I don't speak the language.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.080
I'm at a huge disadvantage.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.080
We're in a church and we're having service and the church is 100% Spanish.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.080
And here's six gringos.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.080
None of us speak Spanish whatsoever.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.080
I was the most advanced, and any of you that have spoken Spanish with me, you know that's pitiful.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.080
We had some guys trying to speak Spanish and it was like, just don't even try.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.080
Seriously, it was bad.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:21.080
Thankfully, we had an interpreter so we could hear, we could understand what was going on in the service.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.080
And I'll never forget it.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.080
This man after the service, he just came and stood there next to me.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.080
Spanish man.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.080
And he tried to talk to me.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.080
I have no idea what he's saying.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.080
Not a clue.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080
But he tried to talk to me.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.080
He wanted to communicate.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.080
And I tried.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.080
And we just kind of couldn't get anywhere.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.080
But he just stood there.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.080
A few minutes would pass and he'd try again.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.080
I'm like, my brother, I didn't learn Spanish yet.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080
I still don't understand.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080
No comprendo, right?

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.080
Like I got nothing.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.080
But what was it that was drawing that?

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.080
There's a love for the brethren.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.080
I want you to think about the impact of this truth.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.080
We see the truth imparted.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.080
We see it illustrated through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.080
We see that we need to implement this truth.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.080
We need to understand that as I walk in the light, I'm going to love the brethren.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.080
It's an evidence that's here.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:29.080
It's a way in which we can examine our own lives and see where we stand and how our walk with God is.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.080
By the way, let me say this.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:38.080
I'm thankful that God gives us some means by which we can evaluate our spiritual growth.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.080
Amen?

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.080
It's not just my criteria.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.080
Because if it's my criteria, I'm doing great.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.080
And if it's your criteria, you're doing great.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.080
And if we're carnal, we become like the Corinthians and we compare ourselves amongst ourselves.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080
Right?

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.080
And guess what we do when we want to compare ourselves amongst ourselves?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.080
Who is it that we typically find to compare ourselves to?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.080
The best of the best?

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.080
The lowest of the lowest?

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.080
You know how many times I've talked to somebody and said,

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.080
hey, do you, asking about knowing the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080
are you a sinner?

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.080
I never murdered anybody.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.080
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.080
I mean, aren't you?

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.080
Like, I'm glad that you're not a murderer.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.080
But that's not the criteria by which we determine if we're a sinner.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080
Amen?

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.080
I'm not as bad as those other guys.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.080
You think about the Pharisees, right?

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.080
I'm glad I'm not like that publican.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.080
Right?

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:45.080
And so God gives us some criteria in His Word that we can evaluate our own lives.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.080
We can say, we've been told that we're to walk in the light.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.080
How am I doing?

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.080
How am I doing?

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.080
Is there a love that I have for the brethren?

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080
But think about the impact.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.080
Think about the impact.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080
Turn back to John 13.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.080
We'll close here.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.080
John chapter number 13.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:13.080
We read verse number 34 a few times already this morning.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:20.080
Jesus says, a new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another,

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.080
as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080
Notice the impact in verse 35.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.080
By this.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080
By this.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080
By what?

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.080
By our love one for another.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.080
By this shall all men, what's that next word?

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:48.080
Know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.080
If you have love one to another.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.080
You see the impact?

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.080
It says, by this shall all men know that you are my disciples.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.080
What does the world think when the church is fighting?

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.080
What does the world think when the church is divided, like in Corinth?

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.080
I'm not talking about over doctrinal things.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.080
I'm talking about over petty things.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.080
Over insignificant things.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.080
Things that matter not in the light of eternity.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:28.080
And there's divisions and there's schisms and there's animosity and hatred.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:34.080
Oh man, we're not showing the world what we're really supposed to show the world.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.080
By this, by our love one for another that we love as Christ loved,

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:44.080
by this shall all men know that you are my disciples,

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.080
if you have love one to another.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:59.080
It's amazing how many people have the opinion of believers being hateful.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:04.080
I spent some time in the presence of someone recently.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.080
And I made this statement to this person.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.080
They were actually lost.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:16.080
And they asked a question and I said, well, because I love you.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.080
And they said, I just can't understand that.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.080
I just can't understand that.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.080
They questioned the love of God, but then to think that some human person

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.080
that's not of any relation would have a love for them?

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.080
It's beyond their comprehension.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.080
And when we love the brethren as we've been commanded to do so,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.080
and it provides evidence that we're walking in the light,

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.080
it has a great impact on the society in which we live.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.080
And we are called to impact our society, are we not?

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.080
We're called to make a difference.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.080
And this morning as we think about this love one another,

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.080
I trust that God would help us.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.080
I can't do it in my own flesh. I can't do it in my own power.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.080
I must walk in the Spirit. I must have the fruit of the Spirit, love.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.080
I understand it's through the Holy Spirit of God that indwells me,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.080
that enables me to love, that enables you to love.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.080
Are there going to be some things that are going to challenge our love one for another?

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:21.080
You bet.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:27.080
But the reality is that God says that we're to love as He loved.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.080
And it was with a perfect love.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.080
And the only way I can do that is as I yield myself to Him

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.080
and allow Him to love through me.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.080
That you love one another.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.080
This morning, I walk in the light.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.080
I'm walking in the light. Are you?

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.080
Here's a test for you.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.080
How's your love one for another?

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.080
Because this is a test that you take and you examine yourself and you say,

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.080
am I walking in light? Am I walking in darkness?

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.080
It's the love for the brethren that help us to be able to examine

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.080
and to know that we're walking in the light.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.080
Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.080
Thank you for loving us.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.080
We spoke of this subject matter this morning of love.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.080
Lord, I pray that you'd help us that your Holy Spirit would speak to hearts

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.080
and move in ways that only He can.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.080
Lord, you know our hearts.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.080
Help us not to be deceived.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.080
Help us not to deceive ourselves.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:37.080
Lord, help us to walk in the light as you're in the light.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:42.080
Help us to love as you loved.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.080
I pray that, Lord, you would...

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.080
There's one present that's not sure of heaven.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:54.080
This morning, they would understand your love for them.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.080
That you love them so much that you came to this sin-cursed world

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.080
and you died for them.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.080
You rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.080
You died for them to pay for their sins

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:12.080
so they could be saved and become your children, your child.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.080
Lord, if there's someone not saved this morning,

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.080
I pray that they'd get it settled before they leave.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.080
Those of us that are saved, would you help us to walk in love

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.080
as the believers in Ephesus are challenged and encouraged?

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.080
I pray that you'd move and work, have your way.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.080
We'll thank you for it.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.080
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.080
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.080
This morning, the Spirit of God may have spoken to you in some way or another.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.080
Would you like to take a moment to respond?

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.080
And as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.080
Maybe you want to come and thank God for His love.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.080
Maybe you want to ask God to search you and to help you to love the brethren.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:01.200
increase more and more. As he said to the believers in Thessalonica,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.280
not that we just get content where we are, so now we're to increase more and

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.640
more. I'm loving the brethren, but God help me to love them more. Help me to be

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.040
seen in my life. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
