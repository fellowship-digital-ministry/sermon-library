00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
Verse number 1, admittedly at the onset of the message this evening, it's going to be

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.420
a springboard into other portions of Scripture that we'll be looking at, but we look here

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.479
in 2 Thessalonians 2 and look at verse number 1 and I want you to note, as we consider the

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:24.420
text of Scripture before us, the Apostle Paul is the human penman to the book of 2 Thessalonians.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.079
I believe the Apostle Paul was a man who was fully surrendered, he fully surrendered his

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.860
life. Joseph, this sounds really weird to me. Does this sound weird to you guys? No.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.459
It just sounds really weird to me up here. I'm not sure what that is with maybe the monitors

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.580
or something, but the Apostle Paul was a man who fully surrendered his life to Christ.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.360
I believe that he recognized that he was bought with a price and daily, I believe, as you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.860
study the life of the Apostle Paul, that he lived to glorify his Savior. He spoke about

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.040
living a life that was in full surrender. I am crucified with Christ. He said, I die

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.080
daily. He said that his desire was to bring honor and glory to his Lord. And I believe

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.080
that as you study his life and you begin to understand the truth of his surrender, that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.160
as a result, the Lord used him in a mighty way. It sounds better, so thank you. And so

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.199
the Lord used him in a mighty way. It was during his second missionary journey that

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.139
God allowed him to enter into the city of Thessalonica. And we understand that by God's

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:34.300
grace a local church was established in the city of Thessalonica. God would then use the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.860
Apostle Paul to write the epistle of 1 Thessalonians to the church. And then again, this epistle

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.900
that we're looking at this evening, 2 Thessalonians. And we find that as God would use the Apostle

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
Paul, of course, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, to pen these letters

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:55.559
to these believers, we find that there was need for not only instruction, but there was

00:01:55.559 --> 00:02:01.080
need for encouragement. The believers in Thessalonica were dealing with some great adversity. There

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.339
was much persecution that they were enduring. Of course, the Apostle Paul, as you read the

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:12.000
first letter to the church at Thessalonica, 1 Thessalonians, you will find that the Apostle

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Paul rehearses and reminds them of the persecution that he and his team even endured at the beginning,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.339
at the start of that church. And as we begin to think about the need for encouragement,

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.500
we understand this evening that there are times in our lives that each and every one

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.259
of us are in need of encouragement. There are circumstances and events that take place

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:38.440
in our lives. And what a blessing it is that someone would come alongside and encourage

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.619
us and give us that encouragement that we need. I'm thankful that even if there's not

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:49.779
a man that would come and encourage us, that God will encourage us. The Bible tells us

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:54.100
in Psalm chapter number three, we're reminded that the Lord is not only my helper and my

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.300
shield, but he is the lifter up of mine head. And what a blessing to think about that, because

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.259
David, as he's writing that third Psalm, he's dealing with much adversity, many reasons

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.619
in which he could be discouraged. But he says, the Lord is the lifter up of mine head. Many

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.660
years earlier in his life, if you look at the event, really, that seems to be surrounding

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.419
the penning of the third Psalm, that's really later in his life with the revolt of Absalom

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.339
and all that was taking place. But I want you to think about earlier, much earlier in

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:32.139
his life, even before he ascended to the throne, the Bible tells us that after the Amalekites

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.460
came in, the Ziklag and all that took place, and the men were ready to stone him, the Bible

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.259
tells us that David encouraged himself in the Lord. And what a blessing. This church

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.899
was in need of some encouragement. Not only were they in need of encouragement, but they

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:51.940
were in need of some instruction. If we'd be honest, we understand that we too, at times,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.059
we don't know, we don't know everything and we need to be instructed. We need to be instructed

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:02.699
in the ways of the Lord. And I'm thankful that even as I mentioned this morning, on

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.100
this Wednesday evening, we'll be dealing with the subject that the Lord is my teacher.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.460
And I'm thankful that we have a divine teacher. I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit, the author

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.220
of Scripture, that he is the divine teacher. One of his ministries is to teach and begin

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.339
to think about the truth. And now as we consider and just kind of set the background, if you

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:27.019
will, for this particular verse of Scripture, we find they've been encouraged and now they'll

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:31.820
be instructed. Notice what it says in verse number one of 2 Thessalonians chapter number

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:41.019
two. The apostle Paul says this, now we beseech you brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:47.019
Christ, I'm thankful that he's coming. Aren't you? He's saying tonight about Jesus is coming

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.459
again. And man, that first song that we sang this evening, man, it was, you were, I mentioned

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.579
it right after I got up here. You sang it like you believed it. You're singing it like

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:59.859
you were waiting for him to come. You're listening for the trumpet. Amen. And brother Mershawn

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.380
will be with us in September. And he always says, I'm looking for the upper taker, not

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.179
the undertaker. And a hallelujah, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Notice what it says.

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:19.739
And by our gathering together unto him, our gathering together unto him. I've used that

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:25.980
phrase at the end of verse number one as the title for our message this evening, our gathering

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.660
together unto him. He continues and says this in verse number two, that you be not

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.820
soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.859
us as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:52.100
shall not come except there shall come a falling away first. And that man of sin be revealed

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.540
the son of perdition. We find that in these few verses leading through the teaching that

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.579
will go and fully be given in 2 Thessalonians chapter number two, that the apostle Paul

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:08.459
is seeking to instruct these believers. And he says, he gives us some insight in verse

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:12.660
number two as to what was taking place. He says that you be not soon shaken in mind or

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.260
be troubled neither by spirit nor by word. Notice what he says, nor by letter as from

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.619
us as that the day of Christ is at hand. It seems quite evident as you were to study

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:28.579
the epistle of 2 Thessalonians that there were some that were trying to deceive the

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:35.579
believers in the church that were actually writing letters under the guise of being from

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:42.299
the apostle Paul saying that the day of Christ was at hand. And we find that Paul says, listen,

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:48.820
let no man deceive you by any means. He says in verse number five, remember ye not that

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:54.940
when I was yet with you I told you these things. Listen, we too forget some things, don't we?

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.739
We begin to hear something else and there's some other something that comes along. Listen,

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:04.339
I'm so thankful for the word of God that we have this whole book, the complete canon of

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:11.220
scripture that we can go to and we can understand what God has given us and what he has revealed

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.640
to us. And we find here that as we begin to look and focus in our attention on this thought,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.079
our gathering together unto him. I began to do some study as I was preparing for the

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:30.079
message and I don't often get into the languages, but this was of great interest to me as I

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.640
looked at this particular verse of scripture and noted that phrase, our gathering together

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:45.279
unto him. The Greek word that is used there is only used two times in all of the New Testament.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:52.399
And that often when you see something like that as I study and I prepare, as you see

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:57.920
a particular word that is used just a one or two or three times, it's of interest. You

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.320
want to find out where else that word might be used. And it was of great interest to me

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.200
because here in 2 Thessalonians 2 and verse number one, the apostle Paul is writing to

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.200
a local church and he's writing to a local church about a future event, our gathering

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.760
together unto him. It's a future event. But as he's writing to them and he uses that word

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:29.160
that is translated for us gathering together, the only other time in the New Testament that

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.359
that word is used is in Hebrews 10 verse 25. And it's in that verse of scripture that the

00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:42.359
Bible teaches us not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the matter of some

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:50.359
is, but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching. So

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.359
I want you to think about this and I hope that this evening it will be an encouragement

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:59.440
to you if you're taking notes, number one, the current gathering. We're going to get

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.239
to the truth of our text of scripture, our gathering together unto him. But as we consider

00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:09.919
this evening, this word that's only used twice in all of the New Testament, I want you to

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:15.760
consider the current gathering. The apostle Paul is writing to a local church. A local

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.760
church by definition is to assemble, to gather together. The Greek word for church is ekklesia.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.479
I think it's like 107 out of 113 times in the New Testament it's referring to the local

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:39.479
church. Almost exclusively you find that when the church is referenced in the New Testament

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.200
it's local church. We understand and we could speak about the universal church, but we speak

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.559
as we look at the letters that are written, the epistles that are written to local New

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:57.659
Testament churches. And we find that as the apostle Paul would encourage these believers

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:59.960
and instruct these believers with regard...

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.960
to a future gathering, he uses that same word

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.960
that he would give the instruction with regard to our current gathering.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.960
I mean, think about the current gathering, the local church.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.960
Turn over to Hebrews 10, if you will, and I want you to see here just a couple of things

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.960
as we think about the current gathering.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.960
The church is to assemble.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960
We argued that greatly over the last few years.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.960
We fought for that.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.960
Why? Because the church, by definition, assembles.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.960
That's what it does.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.960
We need each other.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.960
Listen, you understand this evening that the church

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.960
was not the idea of Constantine or some other individual.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.960
The church is God's idea.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.960
Let me say it this way. The church is God's bride.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.960
The church is important.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.960
The Bible tells us in Ephesians 5, as husbands are to love your wives,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.960
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.960
God has no other program, no other plan for this era but the church,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960
the local New Testament church.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.960
And the church is to gather.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.960
The church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960
And what a joy to understand that.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960
When we begin to think about the current gathering again,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.960
he's writing, and I hope this evening we can understand,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.960
I can effectively communicate what God's put in my heart.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.960
But we think about this local church at Thessalonica,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.960
and as they would gather together, their current gathering,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.960
they were being encouraged from Paul with regard to a coming gathering,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.960
a future gathering.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.960
But we focus just for a moment on the current gathering, the purpose.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.960
What is the purpose that we gather?

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.960
Notice in verse number 24, the Bible says this,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:53.960
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.960
Now that word provoke sometimes can be used in a negative context.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.960
Somebody provoked me to do something and what have you.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.960
But we find that it can also be used, as we find here in this text,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.960
in a very positive manner.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.960
The Bible teaches that fathers were not to provoke our children unto wrath.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.960
But we find here that he says, what are we doing?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.960
We're considering one another, and then notice where he says,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.960
to provoke unto love and to good works.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.960
The word provoke in the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.960
is first defined this way, to call into action.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.960
I like that.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.960
To call into action, to provoke.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.960
And what is it that we're calling one another into action to do

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960
as we're considering one another and provoking?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.960
It's unto love and to good works.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.960
Now consider with me the first aspect in verse number 24

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.960
as he says that it's to provoke unto love.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.960
Jesus said this, turn over to John 13, if you will.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.960
Keep your place here in Hebrews, we'll be back in just a moment.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.960
But look over at John chapter number 13 and notice with me what Jesus says.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960
This is, of course, the last few days that he would be here on earth

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.960
before he'd go to the cross of Calvary.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.960
He was preparing his disciples for all that would take place.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.960
He had just washed the feet of the disciples to start the 13th chapter,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.960
giving them great teaching and great instruction,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.960
an example of being a servant.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.960
The lady sang this morning, make me a servant, dear Lord,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960
and what a great song.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960
But we find at the end of this text of Scripture,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.960
notice in verse number 34, Jesus says this,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.960
A new commandment I give unto you,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.960
that ye love one another as I have loved you,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.960
that ye also love one another.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.960
By this, by what our love one for another,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.960
shall all men know that ye are my disciples,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.960
if ye have love one to another.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.960
So the first purpose as we look at this text in Hebrews 10, verses 24 and 25,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.960
that uses this word with regard to this gathering,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.960
this current gathering.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.960
We gather together, we're considering one another,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.960
we're provoking one another first to love, to love.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.960
We're to love as Christ loved.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.960
We find that he says that by this, by our love one for another,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.960
all men will know that we're his disciples.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.960
We studied last year through the book of 1 John,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.960
many times as you reference through the book of 1 John,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.960
you see the reference to brotherly love and loving one another.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.960
And the fact of the matter is that he says there that if you say that you love God

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.960
but you hate your brother, you're a liar.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.960
I mean, that's strong language.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.960
He says, listen, you can claim anything, but what does the evidence support?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.960
We find that here Jesus would give this instruction,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.960
and it's so interesting to me when you think about the greater context

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.960
of the instruction that Jesus is giving.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.960
He's speaking about love here, and then he gets into the 14th chapter,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.960
and he says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960
He says, you believe in God, believe also in me.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.960
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.960
Notice, I go to prepare a place for you.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.960
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.960
notice where he says, and receive you unto myself.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.960
That's exactly the gathering that we're speaking about in 2 Thessalonians 2,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.960
in verse number one.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.960
But before Jesus would come back and receive us unto ourselves,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.960
there's a current gathering.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.960
The saints of God are to gather together.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.960
We find this provoking one another to love.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.960
Notice he says, and good works.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.960
We know that good works don't save anyone.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.960
They can't. It's impossible.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.960
But we do understand that the fruit of salvation is good works.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.960
You read the book of Titus.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.960
You find repeatedly through the book of Titus about good works.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960
You read in the book of Ephesians.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.960
Notice, we'll look at that passage, Ephesians chapter number 2.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.960
We'll get back to Hebrews in just a moment.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.960
But in Ephesians chapter number 2, we notice here in this text of Scripture,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.960
we often reference verses 8 and 9 of the book of Ephesians

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.960
with regard to salvation by grace through faith, apart from works.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960
The Bible says in verse number 8 of Ephesians 2,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960
for by grace are you saved through faith,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.960
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.960
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.960
He continues this. He says,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:30.960
for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.960
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960
We don't work to gain our salvation.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.960
We don't work to keep our salvation.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.960
But we are to work for the master.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.960
And what a privilege it is to serve him.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960
What a privilege.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.960
And notice as we look at that current gathering,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.960
as that word is used in Hebrews 10 in verse number 25,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.960
but we look at the preceding verse in verse number 24,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.960
and speaking about this current gathering,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960
and we're to consider one another,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.960
and to provoke unto love and to good works.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960
Then he says this,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.960
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960
And then notice this little phrase,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.960
he says the manner of some is.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.960
You know, as you read this verse of Scripture

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.960
and you think about that little statement,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.960
even all the way back in the first century,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.960
there were some that were forsaking the assembling.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.960
It's nothing new that folks don't attend church regularly.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.960
It should not discourage us.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.960
It should not be a source of discouragement.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.960
But we do find that there is, as we find here,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.960
evidence that there were some that were forsaking the assembling.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.960
I believe this evening it is a great privilege to assemble.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.960
I really do.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.960
Listen, it bothers me greatly when we can't assemble.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.960
I hate snow on Saturdays.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
I just do.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960
I really do.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960
It bothers me greatly.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960
Why?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960
Because I want to assemble.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.960
The church is supposed to assemble.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.960
Down here on this earth we have things at times,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.960
I'm not talking about excuses for not assembling,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.960
decisions that someone will make on not assembling,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.960
but I'm just talking about circumstances that could prevent the assembling.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.960
I'm talking about weather.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.960
I'm talking about sickness and all of those types of things.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960
Listen, you get ill and you get sick

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.960
and you can't be in church for a period of time.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.960
I talk to Ms. Joyce every time I see her.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960
You know what she says to me?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.960
I want to be in church.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.960
I just want to be in church.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.960
Give her an iPad so that she can watch church.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960
She has the iPad with her.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960
She might be watching tonight.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.960
I don't know.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.960
But you know what she says?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.960
It's not the same.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.960
I agree 100%.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.960
It's not the same.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.960
There's something about gathering.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.960
About gathering.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.960
You can look at the statistics and you can find that church attendance has been on the decline

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.960
even before COVID.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.960
And of course, it's increased exponentially with COVID and even after and what have you.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.960
But I want you to see that he continues and he says this,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.960
but exhorting one another.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.960
Exhorting one another.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.960
And I want you to think about that word, exhorting one another.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960
It carries with it the idea of encouraging.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.960
It carries with it this idea to call to one side.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.960
You know, you can't do that unless you assemble.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.960
You can't be called to someone's side to aid them and to encourage them.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:51.960
You cannot be effective in that responsibility of that purpose of gathering if you don't assemble.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.960
It's just not possible.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.960
Can't do it.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.960
We find that he continues and so much.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.480
The more so much the more as you see the day

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.800
Approaching. Let me ask you church. Do you see the day approaching? I

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.540
mean seriously and

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.000
He said so much the more

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.020
We got churches all over our landscape that are canceling services

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.720
I'm talking about just taking it off their service schedule entirely

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.320
I'm talking about I I've spoken with people that that don't even attend our church that say yeah

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:36.520
You know our church stopped having we don't have this service anymore. We don't have a Sunday night service anymore

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.580
We don't have a Wednesday night service anymore. We don't have a Sunday school anymore. We don't

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.580
Listen the Bible says and so much the more as you see the day

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.360
approaching

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.920
I'm thankful that God has given us

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.720
This instruction with regard to the current gathering we understand ultimately that as we gather together

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.560
Yes to provoke one another and to love and good works to exhort one another

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.640
Ultimately, we're to worship the Lord

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.200
We get to come and corporately

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.980
Worship God as a body of believers

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.600
You know, it's a it's a blessing

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.360
you think about singing the great hymns of the faith and

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.480
That that singing this evening and

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.080
This morning you just think about singing the great hymns of faith as we're we're worshiping God

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.880
We're seeking to exalt and magnify our God in a sense

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.000
I believe that this current gathering

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.160
That we speak of that we see in the text as we would look at these two references within

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.120
The New Testament of this single Greek word the two places in which it's used

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:52.360
We see the current gathering and I would say this in a sense this evening. The current gathering is preparation for a coming gathering

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.700
Number one the current gathering number two consider with me a coming

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.840
Gathering we go back to 2nd Thessalonians chapter number two

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:11.000
In verse number one and the Bible says now we beseech you brethren notice by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.680
I'm so thankful that he's coming

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.000
I don't know the day nor the hour and neither do you and by the way, if anyone tells you they do they're lying on

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.880
the authority of God's Word

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.120
No man knoweth the hour

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.520
Amen, all these people that want to try to predict and say it's going to be no no

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.520
God said there's people that try to get into numerology and they want to study all these things and got all this extensive

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.920
No man knows

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880
No man knows

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120
But he's coming

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.520
he's coming and he says by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ notice this and by our

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.800
gathering together

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320
unto him I

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.600
Hope this evening that just reading those words

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.120
About our gathering together unto him

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.000
encourages your heart

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.200
Because one day one glorious day

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600
We are going to be gathered together

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.560
Unto him

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.480
Who's him of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior?

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.200
We'll see him many songs have been written about seeing our Savior face to face and what a wonderful

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.160
glorious truth that is and

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.640
This evening as we begin to think about the the truth that is before us

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.640
I want you to go back just a few pages the first Thessalonians chapter number four and look at the previous teaching because remember

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.920
Paul said in verse number five of 2nd Thessalonians to remember ye not that when I was yet with you

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.640
I told you these things not only when he was there

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:51.600
But even in the first epistle that he wrote and notice what he says beginning in chapter 4 in verse number 13 of 1st Thessalonians

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.200
He says but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.120
concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope and

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.440
What a joy to know that God has given us the instruction. He wants us to be informed

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:11.080
He wants us to understand some things and he says this for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.880
Hallelujah, he died

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.920
According to the scriptures. He was buried and he rose again

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.160
According to the scriptures and he ever liveth to make intercession for us notice

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.400
It says even so them also would sleep in Jesus will God bring with him

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.320
That's those that would die before his return

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.760
We know some people that have died some saints of God that have died and

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.840
Jesus has not come back because we're still here

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.760
They died

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.320
And so it says here that he's speaking about those that that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him notice

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.640
What he says in verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.840
This is not Paul just sharing his opinion. This is not Paul

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.640
Just saying I'm gonna give you my thoughts or my ideas here. This is my two cents

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.760
No by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.320
Shall not prevent them which are asleep now. No, I I hope I'm part of that alive and remaining when he comes

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.560
I really do I'll be 43 in July. I still consider that to be young

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.800
It's not as young as it used to be because several years ago. It was younger younger

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.320
Just you know

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.640
it's going the other way and some of you know and

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:31.360
Someone told me last week that the the birthday they were celebrating this week was the last one that they're celebrating and they're gonna just start

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.360
celebrating every other year and

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:40.760
The reality is that we're each of us are getting older, but I I really I think it'd be wonderful to be alive

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.800
when the Lord comes back I

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.160
Don't know if I will or not, but it'd be precious but notice in verse 16

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.280
for the Lord

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.520
himself

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.740
Shall descend from heaven with a shout aren't you thankful? He's not just sending an angel

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.080
He's coming himself

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080
What did that what did they say at the?

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.920
Ascension those angels that were sitting there with the disciples that said hey, why stand you gazing up in heaven this?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.280
same

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.160
Jesus and here we find that the Bible says for the Lord

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.160
himself

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.600
Shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel and with the trump of God

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.520
The dead in Christ shall rise first then

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.680
We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.280
but notice what it says at the end of verse number 17 and

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.600
So shall we ever be?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320
with the Lord

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.320
Wherefore

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.000
Comfort one another with these words

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.280
These words are comforting words. In fact, these are some of the most comforting words that I know

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.680
And you begin to look here at this text of Scripture and begin to think about this coming

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:08.480
Gathering that is spoken of when the Apostle Paul is saying to these believers that are in need of encouragement in need of instruction

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.840
He says listen. I beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.320
gathering together

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.320
unto him

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:25.440
The great significance about this event is that we're going to be with the Lord the one who died for us

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.880
the one who loves us I

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.520
Mean we can't even comprehend

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.560
All that he is to us, but we will ever be

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.400
with the Lord

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.720
That's wonderful

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.960
Notice as we look in the second chapter or the second chapter of 2nd Thessalonians, it says our

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.880
Gathering together unto him here

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.520
We find the Bible teaches in 1st Thessalonians 4 it says and by the way

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.840
Though this event is explained to us as to the process or the progress and what's going to take place

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.440
You understand that happens like that it faster than that

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.880
In a moment the twinkling of an eye

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:15.240
So 1st Corinthians 15 says and so we find here that the Bible says that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven in verse 16

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.160
With the shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:26.840
We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds. So notice this great gathering

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.520
this great gathering

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720
We think about the church in

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.920
Thessalonica you think about that local church we think about fellowship Baptist Church here in Oakton, Virginia

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.280
and we think as we look at the New Testament and look at all of the references and

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:45.080
so many of them specifically being dealt with in a

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.320
Approaching the the subject of a local church, but now you think about all of the redeemed

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.400
gathering together

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.000
What a reunion

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.800
What a gathering that will be

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.880
Begin to think about this

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:08.080
Gathering and I begin to think about this truth where the Bible says then we which are alive the dead in Christ

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.480
They're gonna rise first, but then we which are alive remain shall be caught up

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:18.600
Notice what it says together with them in the clouds and we're going to meet the Lord in the air

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.520
And it says and so shall we ever be with the Lord

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.320
And there's gonna be a great reunion you ever go to a family reunion I

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.840
Mean you have family reunion, right? I haven't been to a

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:39.960
As a child, I remember going to a couple of family reunions and remember meeting people. I never met before

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.400
And as you get older, I mean at least on on my parents side of the family and what-have-you

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.040
There's not I don't even remember the last time there was a new reunion that was scheduled or planned

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:58.119
But it seems as if at this stage in life most times the reunion takes place unfortunately at a funeral

00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:04.239
And a funeral is a setting, if you will, if we could look at it that way, as a time of

00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:10.639
a gathering and people, there's some level of family that gathers in a reunion of a sense.

00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:15.219
And I know that now, at the age that I am, I meet these people, I say, you don't remember

00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:17.219
me, do you?

00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:18.619
Sorry.

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:19.619
No idea.

00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:24.379
You ever have somebody say, they say, well, yeah, you were just in diapers the last time

00:30:24.379 --> 00:30:25.379
I saw you.

00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:29.139
Well, that was a lot of years ago.

00:30:29.139 --> 00:30:32.819
And they want to remind you of some things when you're a little kid and what have you.

00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:37.039
But the reality is that we know what it is to have a reunion.

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.859
See somebody that you've not seen for a while.

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:44.219
Not too long ago, we preached from Genesis with the reunion between Jacob and Esau.

00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:46.459
Man, what a reunion that was.

00:30:46.459 --> 00:30:51.859
I mean, there was some fear and trepidation with regard to how the receiving would be

00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:53.379
and all that would take place.

00:30:53.379 --> 00:30:56.379
But when you read the text of Scripture, you see a great reunion.

00:30:56.379 --> 00:31:03.499
I want you to think about all the saints of God, all the redeemed, gathering together.

00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:08.819
I mean, the most glorious part of it is that we're being brought together unto the Lord.

00:31:08.819 --> 00:31:12.379
But what a gathering that's going to be.

00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:18.739
See here, when we think about the current gathering, in a certain sense, it's temporary.

00:31:18.739 --> 00:31:22.739
We gather together and then we depart.

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:26.059
We gather together and then we depart.

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:28.499
Some depart sooner than others.

00:31:28.499 --> 00:31:33.019
Some are told by the pastor, you can turn off the lights and lock the doors.

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:35.379
By the way, that encourages me.

00:31:35.379 --> 00:31:37.339
It does.

00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:38.339
Why?

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:40.819
Because there's a bond.

00:31:40.819 --> 00:31:44.739
There's a desire to fellowship.

00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:51.379
But as the gathering that is current, that is amongst local churches, is a temporary

00:31:51.379 --> 00:31:57.219
gathering, that gathering, that coming gathering, is a permanent gathering.

00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.779
There'll be no parting over there.

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:02.219
Isn't that wonderful?

00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:08.539
And as I begin to think about this truth this evening, I begin to consider the wonderful

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:16.019
truth that God has given us about the church, the age in which we're living, and the local

00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:19.059
church, and the ministry in the local church.

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:25.580
The reality is that there are thousands of other local churches around the globe that

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.119
gather together in their region and their locale the same way that we do.

00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:35.179
In fact, if you travel and you go on vacation, maybe you travel for work, you've had the

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:40.739
opportunity to go and gather with another assembly.

00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:45.899
And it's really interesting how you can find brothers and sisters in Christ almost anywhere

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:48.139
you go.

00:32:48.139 --> 00:32:50.940
At times, there's a language barrier.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.299
There's a cultural barrier.

00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:58.179
There's things that are just different to us that we don't understand, and we're different

00:32:58.179 --> 00:32:59.539
to them, and they don't understand.

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:03.339
I think about that language barrier I shared with you when I stood there at the church

00:33:03.339 --> 00:33:08.739
in Arapuato, Mexico, and standing there, and those, I couldn't speak but ten or twelve

00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:11.979
words of Spanish, and they didn't know but two words of English.

00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:18.940
But man, there was something about a bond that we had in Christ, precious.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:26.139
And you can travel all over this world, and you can find believers, and you can find where

00:33:26.139 --> 00:33:31.619
they're gathering in a local assembly, just like we are.

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:36.580
And it's a temporary thing, and at times, we just had the Espinosas with us just a couple

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.580
of Wednesdays ago.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.259
They were here several years ago, and they moved away.

00:33:42.259 --> 00:33:44.940
You know, since they moved away from here, they've been to like three or four different

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.940
places.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.259
They just keep getting moved from one place to another.

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:50.259
We're in a season.

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:57.139
Northern Virginia is known for transient situation, just as what it is.

00:33:57.139 --> 00:34:02.299
In almost twelve years of ministry, we've had several people that have departed, thankfully

00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:06.580
not because they got mad at the preacher.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.699
But people move.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:09.699
We're in a season right now.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.339
We have a farewell fellowship this evening.

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:17.139
We're in a season right now where we have a number of folks that are moving along.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.660
We had a number of folks move last year.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.739
We have a number of folks that are moving this year.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.339
And that's just part of ministry.

00:34:24.339 --> 00:34:27.019
You know what's interesting about it?

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:33.459
God allows those people to move to another location and assemble with a local church

00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:38.579
there in a current gathering.

00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:44.380
And we continue to gather here and by God's grace and with God's help, we'll reach more

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.660
people that will gather together.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.820
And maybe God would be pleased to send us some people like people are being sent from

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.979
us and we gather together, right?

00:34:56.979 --> 00:35:06.979
But one day, there's a coming gathering where all the redeemed, I mean, I hope that encourages

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:13.699
you tonight because this life that we're living, listen, it's not about us trying to build

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:19.419
an empire behind some individual's name or by some church name.

00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:22.380
No, no, it's God's work.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.419
And as we understand that it's God's work and we understand that it's God's church and

00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:30.699
he said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:35:30.699 --> 00:35:35.339
And as he said that he's coming to get his bride, that we know at that time, there's

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:42.440
a future, a coming gathering and what a glorious day that is going to be.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:50.479
And I hope this evening that as we go through a season as a church with some people leaving,

00:35:50.479 --> 00:35:52.139
it just is what it is.

00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:54.019
It's part of ministry.

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:56.299
It's part of ministry in Northern Virginia.

00:35:56.299 --> 00:35:59.979
I was feeling bad, October of last year.

00:35:59.979 --> 00:36:04.419
I didn't know some of the people that are leaving now are leaving, but it was October

00:36:04.419 --> 00:36:05.419
of last year.

00:36:05.419 --> 00:36:09.299
I was, just to be very transparent with you, I was kind of feeling bad for myself.

00:36:09.299 --> 00:36:13.540
It was just for a moment, but I'm just being transparent with you.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.299
And I was heading to a pastor's conference.

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:20.739
By the way, those are never a waste of time.

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:25.100
There are times in which God will allow me to go to a pastor's meeting and be an encouragement

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.139
to someone else.

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:31.739
There are times that God will allow me to go to a pastor's meeting and be encouraged.

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:34.179
It's a blessing.

00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:37.619
And I remember in October, we were going to Pastor Ken Sparks' church where the teens

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:41.059
just had the youth rally out there at Timber Ridge and we're going to his church.

00:36:41.059 --> 00:36:43.600
I was traveling there by myself.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.660
And I remember talking to my good friend in the ministry, Pastor Phil Bishop.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.139
And we're being able to talk and talk about people that were moving away.

00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:53.859
And he said, Oh brother, that's nothing.

00:36:53.859 --> 00:36:56.660
And if you guys know Brother Bishop, he's a real deep voice.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.699
Brother man, that's nothing.

00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:03.739
We have 87 people that are leaving our church this year, right, with this deep voice.

00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:05.540
If you know Brother Bishop, that's how he talks.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.899
I said, what in the world?

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:12.699
There are a lot more people that are just relocating in this particular season.

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:14.940
It's part of ministry.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.959
But the wonderful thing is that we understand it's not our ministry, it's God's ministry.

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:26.760
And as we understand that as God would move people as He sees fit, and again, when we

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.919
understand that it's God's ministry, He's allowed to do that.

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:30.919
Amen?

00:37:30.919 --> 00:37:32.559
Do you agree?

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:33.720
He's allowed to do that.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.519
God is allowed to move people around.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.799
It's His ministry.

00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:38.760
It's His work.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:45.160
And as He moves people around, they get to go and serve in other local places where there's

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.979
a current gathering and use their talents for the Lord.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.859
I've had opportunity to hear of folks that have moved from our church years, again, after

00:37:54.859 --> 00:37:57.040
ministering here for the number of years that I have.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.739
Not that it's an extended period of time, but we've had people that have moved.

00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:05.100
Somebody moved to Florida.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.019
No missions program in their church that they began to attend.

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:12.820
But they were familiar with a missions-minded church here.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.419
They call it pastor.

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:18.339
How do I convince this pastor we need to have a missions conference, that we need to support

00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:19.859
missionaries?

00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:20.859
What can I do?

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:21.859
How can you help me?

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:25.619
And through a series of events and phone calls and interactions and emails and so on and

00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:30.659
so forth, that church that was 50 years old had its first missions conference, supported

00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:33.580
its first missionaries.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.580
That's God's work.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.739
That's what God is able to do.

00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:43.339
And as we consider the current gathering, I hope that God would help us to not be discouraged

00:38:43.339 --> 00:38:49.900
or defeated when people are moving away, when God is moving pieces, that we'd understand

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:57.659
that He has a better view and understanding than we do, that we keep our eyes on the wonderful

00:38:57.659 --> 00:39:04.099
truth that there is a coming gathering, and there'll be no parting over there.

00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:06.140
What a wonderful truth.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.460
We will be with the Lord forever.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.500
And it actually says at the end of verse 17 of 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:26.020
And so shall we, that's the corporate gathering, so shall we, the redeemed, ever be with the Lord.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.539
Isn't that wonderful?

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:28.539
Hallelujah.

00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:32.380
I'm so thankful that God has revealed these truths to us.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.380
I hope that we'd live every day like it's our last day.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.739
I hope that we'd live every day in light of a soon return.

00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:40.539
We're seeing Jesus is coming again.

00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:49.299
If you hear me sing it, maybe evening, maybe morning, maybe noon, maybe evening, and we'll

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:50.299
be soon.

00:39:50.299 --> 00:39:52.380
That's what I say.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.020
I believe Jesus is coming soon.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.059
The Bible teaches us in the book of 1 John, chapter number 3, that every man that hath

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:04.059
this hope in Him. He purifies Himself even as He is pure. That we redeem the time that

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:11.739
we live in light of His soon return. See, there's a current gathering. And in a sense,

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:18.779
it's just preparation for a coming gathering. And what a wonderful gathering that is going

00:40:18.779 --> 00:40:23.419
to be. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank

00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:28.259
You for Your Word, for the truth of Your Word. We thank You for the opportunity that we have

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:34.059
to serve You. I pray God that You would help us to be encouraged this evening. I pray Lord

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:41.259
that as we consider the truth of Your Word with regard to this current gathering, Lord

00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:46.539
that we would be faithful to be in our places. Lord that we would understand the great privilege

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:53.579
that is ours to gather together, understanding that one day, one glorious, glorious day,

00:40:54.659 --> 00:41:00.779
we the redeemed will gather together most importantly unto You, Lord, and to be with

00:41:00.779 --> 00:41:06.299
You forever. I pray God that You'd help us to be faithful. Help us, Lord, to do what

00:41:06.299 --> 00:41:11.939
You've called us to do. I pray that we'd keep our eyes on Jesus, the author, the finisher

00:41:11.939 --> 00:41:16.059
of our faith. Well, thank You for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we

00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:21.379
pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kate's going to play quietly

00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:25.699
on the piano. And as she does, we'll have a time of invitation. Maybe the Lord spoke

00:41:25.699 --> 00:41:28.500
to your heart. Maybe you just want to thank God for the church. You want to thank God

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.339
for the privilege of gathering. Maybe you want to make some commitment to God.
