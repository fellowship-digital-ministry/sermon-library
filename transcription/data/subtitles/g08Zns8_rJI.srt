1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339
Prior to this text that we're going to be looking at,

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,699
the Apostle Paul gave instruction with regard to prayer,

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:10,979
and he said this in 1 Thessalonians 5, in verse number 17,

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:14,760
pray without ceasing.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,899
And you know, prayer is a unique privilege.

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,899
We're so thankful for the fact

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,780
that our God hears and answers prayer,

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,239
and the fact that we have the privilege

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,420
to go boldly under the thorn of grace,

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,419
that access has been granted because of the sacrifice,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,939
and of course the resurrection of our wonderful Savior,

12
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,860
and the fact that he ever liveth to make intercession

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,099
for us, but we know as the people of God,

14
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:44,740
we have this unique opportunity to pray.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,500
And so Paul says in verse 17, pray without ceasing.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,700
He continues to give them more instruction

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,180
over the next several verses,

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,459
and then we come down to verse number 25,

19
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,099
the text verse for tonight, and he says this,

20
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,380
brethren, pray for us.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,580
It's a simple statement, really it's a concise verse,

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,819
just as we've looked at the instruction

23
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,099
contained within this latter portion

24
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,940
of 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,500
and really the bullet point type instruction

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,559
that God is giving to the church at Thessalonica

27
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,019
by way of preservation to every church

28
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,419
throughout the church age.

29
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,779
And so now Paul requests that the believers in Thessalonica

30
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:28,099
engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer

31
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,580
on his behalf, and I've titled the message this evening,

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,260
intercessory prayer, and he simply says,

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,739
brethren, pray for us.

34
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,500
Three thoughts this evening, and really the first couple

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
are pretty quick, and we'll focus most of our attention

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,180
on the third thought this evening,

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,739
but number one, if you're taking notes,

38
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,860
as we look at this passage in this particular verse

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,739
of scripture, I want you to see number one,

40
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,300
the simplicity of the request,

41
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,319
the simplicity of the request.

42
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,059
There's nothing complicated about 1 Thessalonians five

43
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:03,580
in verse number 25, nothing complicated whatsoever.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,379
Brethren, pray for us.

45
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,860
It's a simple verse, it's a simple request.

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,979
We find that Paul knew that, well, excuse me,

47
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,059
they, the believers of Thessalonica,

48
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:20,059
they had the knowledge that Paul was praying for them.

49
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:24,419
And now Paul says, brethren, pray for us.

50
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,139
How is it that they knew that Paul was praying for them?

51
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,699
Well, Paul told them that he was praying for them.

52
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,660
Turn back to the first chapter, if you will,

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,339
of this epistle, and we find this to be the case

54
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,300
in many of the letters that God would use

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,020
the apostle Paul to write.

56
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,580
Of course, we know all scripture is given

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,300
by inspiration of God, but as Paul would minister

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,940
to these believers and churches and individuals

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,759
that he would write to, often, Paul will communicate

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,360
to them that he is praying for them.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,919
Paul believed in prayer, Paul practiced prayer.

62
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,839
He did not simply instruct others to pray

63
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,039
while he himself sat on the sidelines.

64
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,919
I believe that Paul was a great prayer warrior

65
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,639
and that Paul was a man of prayer.

66
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,979
And we find that as he begins this letter

67
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,080
in 1 Thessalonians chapter one,

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
he says this in verse number two.

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,240
We give thanks to God always for you all.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Notice, making mention of you in our prayers,

71
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,399
remembering without ceasing your work of faith

72
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,740
and labor of love and patience of hope

73
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,580
in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father.

74
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,839
We find that Paul, immediately upon penning this letter

75
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:45,119
to this church in Thessalonica, he immediately informs them

76
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,779
of the fact that he is praying for them.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,059
We find that in the third chapter in verse number 10,

78
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,380
look at verse number nine with it.

79
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,699
In verse number nine of 1 Thessalonians three,

80
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,860
the Bible says, for what thanks can we render to God,

81
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,259
again, for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy

82
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,779
for your sakes before our God.

83
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,500
Now, Paul is writing this with regard to the report

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,539
that was brought back from Timothy.

85
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,940
It was a good report with regard to how the believers

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,279
in Thessalonica were doing.

87
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,640
He was concerned about their welfare.

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,220
He was concerned about their walk.

89
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,059
Why?

90
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,959
Because the enemy was attacking and they were suffering

91
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
with great tribulation and great difficulty

92
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,640
and oppression and opposition and so on and so forth.

93
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,880
And so Paul says that he's rejoicing.

94
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,079
But I want you to notice verse number 10.

95
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,079
The Bible says, night and day, praying exceedingly

96
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,220
that we might see your face and might perfect that

97
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,100
which is lacking in your faith.

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,579
Wow, Paul says to them in the first chapter

99
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,940
that we're giving thanks to God always for you all,

100
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,220
making mention of you in our prayers.

101
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,739
And then in chapter number three,

102
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:04,660
he mentions how that he's praying night and day exceedingly.

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,779
He says that the prayer according to verse number 10

104
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,880
is that they might see their face,

105
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,640
but also that they might perfect in them

106
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,100
that which was lacking in their faith.

107
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,920
They needed to grow spiritually.

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,019
By the way, I do not believe that these believers

109
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,399
in Thessalonica were offended by what Paul says

110
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,119
because they knew that Paul loved them

111
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,880
and Paul cared about them.

112
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,619
And Paul wanted to see them grow spiritually.

113
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,119
And so therefore for him to say,

114
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,720
there's some lacking in your faith,

115
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,679
he's not insulting them.

116
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,640
He's simply trying to encourage them

117
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,119
with regard to their spiritual growth.

118
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,839
And I don't believe for one moment

119
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,679
that they were offended by that.

120
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:55,359
And so we find that these believers in Thessalonica,

121
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,160
as we consider the simplicity of the request,

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,600
as we get to the very end of the letter,

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,959
and Paul says, pray without ceasing,

124
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,799
but then he says, brethren, pray for us.

125
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,200
Well, they already knew that Paul was praying for them.

126
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,200
And now they are given the simple request, pray for us.

127
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,640
Pray for us.

128
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,000
You know, prayer is a privilege

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,200
that is reserved for the redeemed.

130
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,899
Is a privilege that is reserved for the redeemed.

131
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,440
I believe the first prayer God ever heard me pray

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,600
was the prayer of salvation.

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,679
When I asked the Lord to save me.

134
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:42,320
And what a privileged prayer is.

135
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,079
We know that oftentimes, it's not as often today

136
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,519
as it was even when I was younger,

137
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,600
you would hear people say, pray for me,

138
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
or you're in our prayers.

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,119
And even thoughts with regard to broadcasting

140
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,799
and on the news and various things

141
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,279
with regard to tragic situations,

142
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,679
they would use that terminology.

143
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:03,320
And so often today, we hear people simply saying,

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm thinking about you, or you're in my thoughts.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And there's an obvious transition, if you will,

146
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,079
with regard to people that they don't even understand

147
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,920
what prayer is.

148
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,920
But prayer is a privilege that is reserved for the redeemed.

149
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,399
That I have access to the very throne room of heaven.

150
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,720
What an amazing truth.

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,600
We see the simplicity of the request.

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Number two, I would say this, the sincerity of the request.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,679
Understand with me that as Paul writes these words

154
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,720
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

155
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,880
a simple request, brethren, pray for us,

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,720
I would say that it's also a sincere request.

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,720
This is not simply a cliche that would be used by believers.

158
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,040
Hey, I'm praying for you, hey, pray for me.

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,959
I don't think it was that situation

160
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,799
where it was just a cliche type of a statement.

161
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:01,720
I believe that Paul was sincere in this request.

162
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,179
Why was it that Paul was sincere?

163
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,459
Well, because Paul understood the power of prayer.

164
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,100
Paul understood that prayer moves the hand of God.

165
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Paul understood that he needed brothers and sisters,

166
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,140
the redeemed of the Lord praying for him.

167
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,100
And Paul sincerely desired that God's people

168
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,500
would pray for him.

169
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Just as he prayed for others,

170
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,100
this is a sincere plea for intercessory prayer.

171
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,500
Again, it's not just a cliche.

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,059
Sometimes we're good at these kind of cliches, if you will,

173
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,500
that we have used these terminologies

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
and I'll be praying for you

175
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
and maybe we don't even think anything about that

176
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,659
after we make that statement.

177
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,940
How sad that would be.

178
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,059
But Paul is sincere in his request.

179
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:55,059
We find here that Paul simply says, brethren, pray for us.

180
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:58,260
I wonder this evening as I think about the simplicity

181
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,299
and the sincerity of the request,

182
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,299
there's no real outline of prayer

183
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,179
that is provided in this portion of Scripture

184
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,179
as to how these believers were to pray for the Apostle Paul.

185
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,739
We find, and we'll look at a couple other passages here

186
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:17,260
in just a moment of where Paul provides some specifics

187
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,900
with regard to how to pray.

188
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,059
But for these believers in Thessalonica,

189
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,619
when they simply say, brethren, pray for us,

190
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:27,140
I know that they knew some things about Paul.

191
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,219
What did they know about Paul?

192
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,460
Well, they knew that he was a missionary.

193
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,140
They knew that he was traveling.

194
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,739
They knew that he was out preaching the gospel.

195
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:37,419
They knew that he faced much opposition.

196
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,460
They knew certain things about the Apostle Paul

197
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,659
which would help them be able to pray specifically

198
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:48,260
about those things, even though they're not outlined here

199
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
in the text of Scripture.

200
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,099
Brethren, pray for us.

201
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:54,580
Let me show you what Paul says to the church at Ephesus.

202
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,859
Turn back to Ephesians 6, if you will.

203
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,900
And I want you to notice the specifics.

204
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,600
that Paul gives to the church at Ephesus.

205
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,700
In Ephesians chapter number six,

206
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
Paul goes through the end of the chapter

207
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,380
dealing with the spiritual battle that we're engaged in,

208
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,880
and he talks about putting on the whole armor of God,

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
and he comes to verse number 18,

210
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,640
and he addresses the subject of prayer

211
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,280
to these believers at Ephesus,

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,660
and he says this in verse 18 of Ephesians six,

213
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,920
praying always with all prayer and supplication

214
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,180
in the spirit, and watching thereunto

215
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,720
with all perseverance and supplication,

216
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
then notice this, for all saints.

217
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
All right, this is the request of, listen,

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,260
as brothers and sisters in Christ,

219
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,060
we ought to be praying one for another, amen?

220
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,440
We ought to be upholding our brothers and sisters in prayer.

221
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,100
We remember it's been a number of years now

222
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,640
since Holly and the girls would sing that song,

223
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,160
but they would sing a wall of prayer.

224
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,700
Oh man, what a powerful song,

225
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,000
and how we need our brothers and sisters in Christ

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,340
to be praying for us, and he says for all saints,

227
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
but then I want you to notice in verse number 19

228
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,640
that Paul then says, and for me.

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,460
So Paul is going to get very specific

230
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
in verse 19 of Ephesians six

231
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,460
with regard to how he desired the believers in Ephesus here

232
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,080
to pray for him, and for me.

233
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,420
Notice what he says, that utterance may be given unto me,

234
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,960
that I may open my mouth boldly

235
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,660
to make known the mystery of the gospel,

236
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,000
for which I am an ambassador in bonds,

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

238
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,840
Now, as we look at the request that Paul gives

239
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,000
to the believers in Ephesus,

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,460
I almost kind of scratch my head and say,

241
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,000
Paul is probably the most bold witness

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,380
that I can read of throughout the New Testament.

243
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,820
I mean, he's a man that goes from place to place,

244
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,400
and he enters into the city,

245
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,460
and he goes right into the synagogues,

246
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,700
and he begins to preach Christ,

247
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,460
reasoning with them out of the scriptures,

248
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,740
and I mean, he faces opposition,

249
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,160
and he faces difficulty, and he just keeps on preaching.

250
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,580
How does Paul have such boldness?

251
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,340
Well, we understand the Holy Spirit of God

252
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,740
gives us boldness, but I believe a great secret

253
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,540
to the boldness that Paul had in his ministry

254
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,340
was that he requested others to pray

255
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,040
that God would give them boldness.

256
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,340
I think about the disciples in Acts chapter number four,

257
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,000
when they're commanded not to teach or preach

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,340
in the name of Jesus any longer,

259
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,640
they'd already been in prison,

260
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
and they'd been threatened, and all of that,

261
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
and they said they prayed that God would give them boldness,

262
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,480
and if you look in the text of Scripture

263
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
in Acts chapter number four,

264
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
you find that they pray for boldness,

265
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
and then about a verse or two later,

266
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,040
they're speaking boldly the gospel.

267
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,040
Paul is a bold witness for the Lord Jesus Christ,

268
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,580
but he makes the request specifically to others,

269
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,260
to his brothers and sisters in Christ,

270
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,260
would you pray for me that I may open my mouth boldly,

271
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
that I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

272
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,700
So guess what?

273
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
I think the believers in Ephesus

274
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
prayed that Paul would have boldness.

275
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,920
It just kind of makes sense if someone asks you,

276
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,980
would you pray for me specifically about this,

277
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,580
that you would pray about that.

278
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,420
So we see that Paul had boldness.

279
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,500
Notice in Colossians chapter number four,

280
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,380
he's writing to this group of people,

281
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,260
this church in Colossae, as we often refer to it as,

282
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,580
but you understand, the people in Ephesus knew Paul.

283
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,800
Paul ministered in Ephesus for a lengthy period of time.

284
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,580
When he writes back to the church at Ephesus,

285
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,020
just as he does to the church at Philippi,

286
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,040
he ministered to both of those churches extensively.

287
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,480
We find that Paul writing to the church in Thessalonica,

288
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,800
it was a limited amount of time

289
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,580
that Paul ministered to the church in Thessalonica.

290
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,160
The church at Colossae, they didn't know him,

291
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,600
they never met him personally.

292
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Paul did not minister in Colossae.

293
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,520
Paul heard about this church in Colossae,

294
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,200
he heard about these believers,

295
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,580
he heard about their faith and about their walk.

296
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,880
We find that Paul did not know them personally.

297
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,240
It was through Epaphras, really probably the pastor

298
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,600
at the church at Colossae,

299
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,140
where Paul learned about these folks,

300
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,520
but Paul extensively tells them in the first chapter,

301
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,840
we don't have time to study it,

302
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,640
but in the first chapter of the book of Colossians,

303
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,240
he goes through how he's praying for them.

304
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,060
People that he never met physically,

305
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,000
that he never ministered to one-on-one,

306
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,620
but he's praying for them.

307
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,860
And then he says to them in Colossians chapter number four,

308
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,240
in verse number two, continue in prayer,

309
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,100
and watch in the same with thanksgiving.

310
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,940
Then notice, with all praying also for us,

311
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,940
that God would open unto us a door of utterance

312
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,900
to speak the mystery of Christ,

313
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,040
for which I am also in bonds,

314
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,800
that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.

315
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Paul doesn't give any specifics

316
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,620
to the church in Thessalonica in the first letter

317
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,220
with regard to how to pray for them.

318
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,620
He simply says, brethren, pray for us.

319
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,500
It's a simple request.

320
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,740
It's a sincere request.

321
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,900
Listen, when you ask somebody to pray for you,

322
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,220
you're sincere in your request.

323
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,680
There's a burden that you're carrying.

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,280
There's a challenge that you're facing.

325
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,200
There's an uncertainty in your future.

326
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,040
There's whatever the circumstance may be,

327
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,080
and you come to somebody and say, would you pray for me?

328
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
What are you revealing?

329
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,920
Well, you're revealing that you believe in prayer.

330
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,760
You're revealing that you believe

331
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,720
that God hears and answers prayer.

332
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,200
I believe that you're revealing that you believe

333
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,220
the person that you're speaking to practices prayer.

334
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,780
It'd be of no reason for me to ask somebody to pray for me

335
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,300
if I do not believe they're a person of prayer.

336
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,500
It just wouldn't make any sense.

337
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,180
But you ask someone to pray for you

338
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,100
because you believe that they believe in

339
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,700
and practice praying.

340
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,620
Just makes sense.

341
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,600
So we find this evening intercessory prayer,

342
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,260
the simplicity of the request,

343
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,760
the sincerity of the request.

344
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,140
But number three, I want you to notice

345
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,100
the supplication of the recipients.

346
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,500
When I speak of the recipients,

347
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,580
I'm speaking of those in Thessalonica

348
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,900
that received the request.

349
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,100
These ones that received the request,

350
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,900
brethren, pray for us,

351
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,540
and how is it that I could speak of this evening

352
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,580
of their supplication?

353
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Well, what do you do when someone asks you to pray for them?

354
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Do you pray for them?

355
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,520
I hope so.

356
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,480
That's how we would respond.

357
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,360
I'm supposed to say,

358
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,880
would you pray for me about this situation?

359
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,040
Now, there's a very practical aspect of this.

360
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,360
I know I have, and I'm sure that

361
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,400
if you'd be honest tonight, you have as well,

362
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,980
that someone's asked you to pray for them and you forgot.

363
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,520
You failed to do so.

364
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,700
Maybe you didn't jot it down.

365
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
Maybe you didn't just,

366
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,360
you thought you made that mental note,

367
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,180
and you found out that you don't remember

368
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,520
as well as you used to, right?

369
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,780
There was a, some of you might know his name.

370
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,340
He's with the Lord now, Dr. Lee Roberson,

371
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,260
a very well-known preacher.

372
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,860
Number of years ago, had a just Tennessee temple.

373
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,080
I mean, just a huge ministry college,

374
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,360
produced a number of preachers and pastors and missionaries,

375
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
a great man of God, and it was said of him,

376
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
I only ever met him once or twice.

377
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,559
He was probably close to 90 whenever I first met him,

378
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,000
and died shortly thereafter,

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,440
but the reality is that it was said of that man,

380
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Dr. Lee Roberson, that anytime you'd ask him to pray for you

381
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,680
he would stop immediately, and he would pray for you.

382
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Why did he do that?

383
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,619
Well, there's a huge ministry, a huge church,

384
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,700
lots of people, and a huge college, and lots of people,

385
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,100
and so he knew that there was no way he would remember

386
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,720
all of those people that had asked him

387
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,840
to pray about certain things,

388
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,380
so he made it a habit in his life.

389
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,220
I don't use the word habit in an inappropriate way

390
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,140
of it just being some religious exercise,

391
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,940
but he made it a practice in his life

392
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,500
that if someone were to say,

393
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,840
will you pray for me about this situation,

394
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,680
he would stop right then, and he would pray for them.

395
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,080
I think that's a good practice.

396
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
The reality this evening is that

397
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,800
as I look at this portion of scripture,

398
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,640
and I see this request,

399
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I believe that the second letter gives us insight

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
with regard to the supplication of these believers

401
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,080
in Thessalonica, the recipients of this request.

402
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,780
Notice with me in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

403
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,780
if you will, in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three.

404
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:06,780
In verse number one, Paul says this,

405
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Finally, brethren, pray for us.

406
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
That sounds awfully familiar to what we just read

407
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
in 1 Thessalonians 5.25.

408
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,780
Brethren, pray for us.

409
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Here, it says, Finally, brethren, pray for us.

410
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,780
But notice verse number one contains some specifics

411
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,780
with regard to how he's now asking

412
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,780
these believers to pray for him.

413
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,780
That the word of the Lord may have free course

414
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,780
and be glorified even as it is with you.

415
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,780
Now, if you were to understand what Paul is referring to

416
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
when he speaks about the word of the Lord

417
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
having free course and being glorified

418
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
even as it is with you,

419
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
he had said to this same group of people

420
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,780
back in the first letter that he wrote to them

421
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
in the second chapter, in verse number 13,

422
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
he said that for this cause also thank we God

423
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,780
without ceasing because when ye received

424
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
the word of God which ye heard of us,

425
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,780
ye received it not as the word of men,

426
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,780
but as it is in truth, the word of God

427
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,780
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

428
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,780
So, Paul is referring to the work

429
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,780
that God's word had in their lives

430
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,780
and he's saying that just as God's word

431
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,780
has been effective in your lives,

432
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,780
I want you to pray that as I minister,

433
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,780
as I take the word of God to other peoples

434
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,780
that God's word would have an impact

435
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,780
and an effect in their lives.

436
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
We mentioned, I said it even this past week

437
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,780
on Sunday morning, how that we are evidence

438
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,780
that the gospel works.

439
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,780
My life, your life this evening

440
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,780
has been transformed by the power of the gospel

441
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
and yet you have people today that say,

442
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
well the gospel just doesn't work anymore,

443
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
there's gotta be a new way,

444
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,780
there's gotta be some more effective.

445
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
No, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

446
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
We find this evening that as I look

447
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,780
at chapter three and verse number one

448
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,780
and I find that Paul is using these believers

449
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,780
as the example, look at how God's word

450
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
changed your lives.

451
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,780
You think about the way in which

452
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,780
they had been transformed by the power

453
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,780
of God's word.

454
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,780
What a joy.

455
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,780
It says in First Thessalonians one in verse nine,

456
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,780
you might want to just jot it down,

457
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,780
but it says how you turn to God

458
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,780
from idols to serve the living and true God.

459
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Hallelujah.

460
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
That's because the gospel, it's because

461
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
the word of God was preached and proclaimed

462
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,780
and it impacted, it affected them.

463
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,780
So he continues in verse number two.

464
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,780
In Second Thessalonians three, verse one,

465
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,780
he talks about praying that the word of the Lord

466
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
would have free course and be glorified

467
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
even as it is with you.

468
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Verse two, and that we may be delivered

469
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,780
from unreasonable and wicked men

470
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,780
for all men have not faith.

471
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Wow.

472
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,780
What a statement.

473
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
The reality is that Paul knew what it was

474
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,780
to face opposition.

475
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Paul knew what it was, seemingly at every turn,

476
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,780
to have someone or someones that were against him.

477
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,780
In fact, it was so intense that even when

478
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,780
he was in Thessalonica, the reason that

479
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
he was there for such a short time

480
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,780
is because the people that were opposing him

481
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
followed after him.

482
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
They would travel from one city to the next.

483
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,780
Why? Because they were opposing the work

484
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,780
that Paul was doing, how God was using him.

485
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,780
We find that he says he's praying for deliverance

486
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,780
from these unreasonable and wicked men

487
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
for all men have not faith.

488
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,780
We understand even still today that we live

489
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
in a wicked, a perverse generation.

490
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
We live, listen, Paul says this in the book

491
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
of Philippians that there are those

492
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,780
that are the enemies of the cross.

493
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
They're in opposition.

494
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
They stand against.

495
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
So he prays for deliverance.

496
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Verse number three, but the Lord is faithful.

497
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Aren't you thankful?

498
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,780
We looked at that last week in 1 Thessalonians 5, 24.

499
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,780
Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.

500
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
We find he says that the Lord is faithful,

501
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,780
and he is, praise God, who shall establish you

502
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
and keep you from evil.

503
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
But then I want you to notice verse number four.

504
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
And I spent all the time looking at those

505
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
first three verses, but I want you to see

506
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
that it's the climax, if you will,

507
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
for this particular point of noticing

508
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
the supplication of the recipients.

509
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Notice what Paul says about these believers

510
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,780
in Thessalonica.

511
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,780
He says, and we, we have confidence

512
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
in the Lord touching you.

513
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,780
Notice that ye both do and will do

514
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,780
the things which we command you.

515
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,780
Now, I'm not going to take the time this evening

516
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,780
to look at all the things that he commanded them,

517
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,780
but I believe with regard to the subject

518
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
that we're studying this evening,

519
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,780
it's abundantly clear that one of the things

520
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,780
he commanded them to do was to pray.

521
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
And so notice what Paul says.

522
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,780
He says we have confidence.

523
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,780
We have confidence in the Lord touching you

524
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,780
that ye both do and will do

525
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,780
the things which we command you.

526
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Don't you think that brought Paul great joy?

527
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Knowing that the people that he was writing to,

528
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,780
the people that he was making this request to,

529
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
a simple, sincere request.

530
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Brethren, pray for us that he had confidence

531
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,780
in knowing that they were going to do

532
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,780
and really, they already do and they will do

533
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,780
that which he has commanded them.

534
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I believe that Paul knew there were some believers

535
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,780
in Thessalonica that were engaged

536
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,780
in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

537
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I believe that when Paul was facing

538
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,780
some of the difficulties that he faced,

539
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,780
that God would encourage him

540
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,780
by knowing that there was an army of people

541
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,780
that were praying for him.

542
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,780
It's amazing so often we'll get

543
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,780
update letters from our missionaries

544
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,780
and they'll say something like this.

545
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Your prayers are effective.

546
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,780
We can sense and see how God is working.

547
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
It's not to be spooky about it

548
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,780
or any kind of crazy thing about it,

549
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,780
but the reality is that prayer works.

550
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Prayer works.

551
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
In the ministry of intercessory prayer

552
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,780
is an amazing ministry.

553
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
One of the things that's interesting is so often

554
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
we think about praying, if we're not careful,

555
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,780
prayer lives can consist more about me

556
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,780
and less about others.

557
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,780
I've said before and it's not something

558
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,780
that I practice often, but I have done it

559
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
on a couple of different occasions

560
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,780
where I like to pray out loud regularly.

561
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
That helps me stay on course.

562
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,780
It helps me not get distracted.

563
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm talking to the Lord and he is present,

564
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
so it just helps me.

565
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,780
But on a few occasions I've recorded myself praying

566
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,780
so that I could listen back to see

567
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,780
really the content of my prayers.

568
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,780
You know it's far better for us to spend time

569
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,780
praying for others than being so consumed

570
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,780
about praying for ourselves.

571
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,780
We find that as we engage in the ministry

572
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,780
of intercessory prayer, one thing that is certain

573
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,780
is that if we're going to engage in the ministry

574
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,780
of intercessory prayer, we need to know,

575
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
and I don't mean in a nosy, inappropriate type

576
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,780
of a way, but we need to know what's going on

577
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,780
in the lives of our brothers and sisters in Christ.

578
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,780
If I'm going to pray, if I'm going to intercede

579
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,780
on your behalf, if I'm going to really

580
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,780
be that prayer warrior, I need to know

581
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
what I'm praying about.

582
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,780
I've often said that God blessed them prayers,

583
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,780
I couldn't care less to have them.

584
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,780
I don't know, you can't really substantiate the prayers.

585
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
God just blessed this person and blessed that person

586
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
and blessed, I mean blessed them real good

587
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
if you get a little Southern in you, you know.

588
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,780
What does that mean?

589
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,780
We end up beginning to pray specifically.

590
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,780
We got a note this afternoon from Brother Dewey Whitfield,

591
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,780
he'd been sharing with me throughout the week

592
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,780
about his wife's injury and the surgery that was upcoming

593
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,780
and not knowing exactly when they'd be able to have it

594
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,780
and we'd been praying throughout the week

595
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,780
and he sent me a text and said,

596
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,780
brother, they just took her back and we were having dinner

597
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,780
and we stopped right then and just prayed.

598
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,780
That's the unique privilege of prayer that at any time,

599
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,780
at any moment, for any reason,

600
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,780
and I was able to text him back and say,

601
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,780
brother, we prayed right now for your wife

602
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
and for this situation.

603
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
What a unique, I'm not patting myself on the back,

604
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm simply saying that it's a unique privilege

605
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,780
that we can pray one for another

606
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,780
and be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

607
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,780
And you know, when we pray one for another,

608
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,780
we see this more, I believe, in Acts 13 and 14

609
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,780
when you study that first missionary journey,

610
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
the church at Antioch, no doubt,

611
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,780
was praying for the apostles.

612
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,020
So Paul, as they went out, Paul and Silas commissioned,

613
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,880
they go out, Paul and Barnabas, excuse me,

614
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,340
commissioned and they go out.

615
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,900
We find that as they would go on this missionary journey

616
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
that they travel to these cities,

617
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,660
but then they come back to the church at Antioch

618
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
and they call the church together.

619
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,860
And the Bible tells us in verse 27

620
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,340
that they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

621
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,460
You know, I believe tonight,

622
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,180
and I know I've preached from this passage of scripture

623
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,280
with regard to the first missions conference

624
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,380
of the local church,

625
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,820
and I really believe that's what that was.

626
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,800
And you find that there were some people

627
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,780
from the church at Antioch that were so excited

628
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,800
to be at that meeting,

629
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,460
to hear everything that was being told to them

630
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,580
that God had done during that missionary journey.

631
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,420
Why?

632
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,260
Because they were invested in prayer.

633
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,820
They were praying.

634
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,700
And through hearing what God did,

635
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,200
you know what they were receiving?

636
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,060
How God answered their prayers.

637
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,740
How God worked.

638
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,260
How God led along the way.

639
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,660
And the people that were saved

640
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,420
and the churches that were established.

641
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,340
And oh man, that caused people to rejoice.

642
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,740
It's just like when we have prayer letters

643
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,480
from our missionaries.

644
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,820
You know, when we have prayer letters

645
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,900
and we have opportunity to share the updates

646
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,220
and be able to share specific prayer requests,

647
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,220
and then when the missionaries send us another response,

648
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,220
another letter, another update,

649
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,340
and they have follow-ups with regard to the things

650
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,380
that they had asked us to pray about,

651
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,340
and then we get to see how God worked and what God did.

652
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,180
You know what?

653
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,180
If you're counted among those that were praying for that,

654
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,700
you rejoice greatly.

655
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,440
Because God answered your prayer.

656
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,740
Intercessory prayer.

657
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,580
Brethren, pray for us.

658
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,500
It's a simple request.

659
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,540
It's a sincere request.

660
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,460
But I believe that as we look at the next letter,

661
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,940
we see the supplication of the recipients.

662
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,860
They were people of prayer.

663
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,120
They engaged in intercessory prayer.

664
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,720
And through that, God worked and God blessed,

665
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,100
and the ministry of the Apostle Paul went forward,

666
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,620
and people heard the gospel,

667
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,560
and people were saved

668
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,220
because there were some believers praying.

669
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,660
What a blessing,

670
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,260
to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

671
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,100
Let's pray together.

672
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,620
Father, we love you.

673
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,540
How we thank you for loving us.

674
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,980
We thank you for the opportunity to study your word.

675
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
We thank you, Lord,

676
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,340
for the opportunity to engage in prayer.

677
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,240
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be people of prayer.

678
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,580
God, that we would pray one for another

679
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,140
as you've commanded us to do so.

680
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,220
Lord, I pray that you would bless

681
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,300
our remainder of our time this evening

682
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,660
as we receive these updates from our missionaries,

683
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,220
as we rejoice in what you've done,

684
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,540
as we take note of how we should pray.

685
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,580
I pray, Lord, that you'd be honored and glorified,

686
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,580
and we'll thank you for it.

687
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,340
In Christ's name we pray.

688
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,180
Amen.

689
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,100
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

690
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,260
You did not get one?
