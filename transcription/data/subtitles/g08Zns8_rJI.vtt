00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.339
Prior to this text that we're going to be looking at,

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.699
the Apostle Paul gave instruction with regard to prayer,

00:00:06.699 --> 00:00:10.979
and he said this in 1 Thessalonians 5, in verse number 17,

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.760
pray without ceasing.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.899
And you know, prayer is a unique privilege.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.899
We're so thankful for the fact

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.780
that our God hears and answers prayer,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.239
and the fact that we have the privilege

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.420
to go boldly under the thorn of grace,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.419
that access has been granted because of the sacrifice,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.939
and of course the resurrection of our wonderful Savior,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.860
and the fact that he ever liveth to make intercession

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.099
for us, but we know as the people of God,

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:44.740
we have this unique opportunity to pray.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.500
And so Paul says in verse 17, pray without ceasing.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.700
He continues to give them more instruction

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.180
over the next several verses,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.459
and then we come down to verse number 25,

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:57.099
the text verse for tonight, and he says this,

00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:00.380
brethren, pray for us.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.580
It's a simple statement, really it's a concise verse,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.819
just as we've looked at the instruction

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.099
contained within this latter portion

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:09.940
of 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.500
and really the bullet point type instruction

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.559
that God is giving to the church at Thessalonica

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:18.019
by way of preservation to every church

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.419
throughout the church age.

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:23.779
And so now Paul requests that the believers in Thessalonica

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:28.099
engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.580
on his behalf, and I've titled the message this evening,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.260
intercessory prayer, and he simply says,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.739
brethren, pray for us.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.500
Three thoughts this evening, and really the first couple

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
are pretty quick, and we'll focus most of our attention

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.180
on the third thought this evening,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.739
but number one, if you're taking notes,

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.860
as we look at this passage in this particular verse

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.739
of scripture, I want you to see number one,

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.300
the simplicity of the request,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.319
the simplicity of the request.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.059
There's nothing complicated about 1 Thessalonians five

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:03.580
in verse number 25, nothing complicated whatsoever.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.379
Brethren, pray for us.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.860
It's a simple verse, it's a simple request.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.979
We find that Paul knew that, well, excuse me,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.059
they, the believers of Thessalonica,

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:20.059
they had the knowledge that Paul was praying for them.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.419
And now Paul says, brethren, pray for us.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.139
How is it that they knew that Paul was praying for them?

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.699
Well, Paul told them that he was praying for them.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.660
Turn back to the first chapter, if you will,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.339
of this epistle, and we find this to be the case

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.300
in many of the letters that God would use

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.020
the apostle Paul to write.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.580
Of course, we know all scripture is given

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.300
by inspiration of God, but as Paul would minister

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.940
to these believers and churches and individuals

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.759
that he would write to, often, Paul will communicate

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.360
to them that he is praying for them.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.919
Paul believed in prayer, Paul practiced prayer.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.839
He did not simply instruct others to pray

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.039
while he himself sat on the sidelines.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.919
I believe that Paul was a great prayer warrior

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.639
and that Paul was a man of prayer.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.979
And we find that as he begins this letter

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.080
in 1 Thessalonians chapter one,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.240
he says this in verse number two.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.240
We give thanks to God always for you all.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Notice, making mention of you in our prayers,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.399
remembering without ceasing your work of faith

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.740
and labor of love and patience of hope

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.580
in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.839
We find that Paul, immediately upon penning this letter

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:45.119
to this church in Thessalonica, he immediately informs them

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.779
of the fact that he is praying for them.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.059
We find that in the third chapter in verse number 10,

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.380
look at verse number nine with it.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.699
In verse number nine of 1 Thessalonians three,

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.860
the Bible says, for what thanks can we render to God,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.259
again, for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.779
for your sakes before our God.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:10.500
Now, Paul is writing this with regard to the report

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.539
that was brought back from Timothy.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.940
It was a good report with regard to how the believers

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.279
in Thessalonica were doing.

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:19.640
He was concerned about their welfare.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.220
He was concerned about their walk.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.059
Why?

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.959
Because the enemy was attacking and they were suffering

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.519
with great tribulation and great difficulty

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.640
and oppression and opposition and so on and so forth.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.880
And so Paul says that he's rejoicing.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.079
But I want you to notice verse number 10.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:40.079
The Bible says, night and day, praying exceedingly

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.220
that we might see your face and might perfect that

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.100
which is lacking in your faith.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.579
Wow, Paul says to them in the first chapter

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:55.940
that we're giving thanks to God always for you all,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.220
making mention of you in our prayers.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.739
And then in chapter number three,

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:04.660
he mentions how that he's praying night and day exceedingly.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.779
He says that the prayer according to verse number 10

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.880
is that they might see their face,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.640
but also that they might perfect in them

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.100
that which was lacking in their faith.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.920
They needed to grow spiritually.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.019
By the way, I do not believe that these believers

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.399
in Thessalonica were offended by what Paul says

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:30.119
because they knew that Paul loved them

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:31.880
and Paul cared about them.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.619
And Paul wanted to see them grow spiritually.

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.119
And so therefore for him to say,

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.720
there's some lacking in your faith,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.679
he's not insulting them.

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:45.640
He's simply trying to encourage them

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.119
with regard to their spiritual growth.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:49.839
And I don't believe for one moment

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.679
that they were offended by that.

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:55.359
And so we find that these believers in Thessalonica,

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:58.160
as we consider the simplicity of the request,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.600
as we get to the very end of the letter,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.959
and Paul says, pray without ceasing,

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.799
but then he says, brethren, pray for us.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:10.200
Well, they already knew that Paul was praying for them.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.200
And now they are given the simple request, pray for us.

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:17.640
Pray for us.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.000
You know, prayer is a privilege

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.200
that is reserved for the redeemed.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:31.899
Is a privilege that is reserved for the redeemed.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:34.440
I believe the first prayer God ever heard me pray

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.600
was the prayer of salvation.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.679
When I asked the Lord to save me.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.320
And what a privileged prayer is.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.079
We know that oftentimes, it's not as often today

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.519
as it was even when I was younger,

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:50.600
you would hear people say, pray for me,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.920
or you're in our prayers.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.119
And even thoughts with regard to broadcasting

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.799
and on the news and various things

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.279
with regard to tragic situations,

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.679
they would use that terminology.

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:03.320
And so often today, we hear people simply saying,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.000
I'm thinking about you, or you're in my thoughts.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And there's an obvious transition, if you will,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.079
with regard to people that they don't even understand

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.920
what prayer is.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.920
But prayer is a privilege that is reserved for the redeemed.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.399
That I have access to the very throne room of heaven.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.720
What an amazing truth.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.600
We see the simplicity of the request.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600
Number two, I would say this, the sincerity of the request.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.679
Understand with me that as Paul writes these words

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:39.720
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.880
a simple request, brethren, pray for us,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.720
I would say that it's also a sincere request.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.720
This is not simply a cliche that would be used by believers.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.040
Hey, I'm praying for you, hey, pray for me.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.959
I don't think it was that situation

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:57.799
where it was just a cliche type of a statement.

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:01.720
I believe that Paul was sincere in this request.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.179
Why was it that Paul was sincere?

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:07.459
Well, because Paul understood the power of prayer.

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:11.100
Paul understood that prayer moves the hand of God.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.100
Paul understood that he needed brothers and sisters,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.140
the redeemed of the Lord praying for him.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.100
And Paul sincerely desired that God's people

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.500
would pray for him.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.700
Just as he prayed for others,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.100
this is a sincere plea for intercessory prayer.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.500
Again, it's not just a cliche.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.059
Sometimes we're good at these kind of cliches, if you will,

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.500
that we have used these terminologies

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
and I'll be praying for you

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.900
and maybe we don't even think anything about that

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.659
after we make that statement.

00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:45.940
How sad that would be.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.059
But Paul is sincere in his request.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:55.059
We find here that Paul simply says, brethren, pray for us.

00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:58.260
I wonder this evening as I think about the simplicity

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.299
and the sincerity of the request,

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:03.299
there's no real outline of prayer

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:06.179
that is provided in this portion of Scripture

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:11.179
as to how these believers were to pray for the Apostle Paul.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.739
We find, and we'll look at a couple other passages here

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:17.260
in just a moment of where Paul provides some specifics

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.900
with regard to how to pray.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.059
But for these believers in Thessalonica,

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:23.619
when they simply say, brethren, pray for us,

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:27.140
I know that they knew some things about Paul.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.219
What did they know about Paul?

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:30.460
Well, they knew that he was a missionary.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.140
They knew that he was traveling.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.739
They knew that he was out preaching the gospel.

00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:37.419
They knew that he faced much opposition.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.460
They knew certain things about the Apostle Paul

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.659
which would help them be able to pray specifically

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:48.260
about those things, even though they're not outlined here

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in the text of Scripture.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.099
Brethren, pray for us.

00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:54.580
Let me show you what Paul says to the church at Ephesus.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.859
Turn back to Ephesians 6, if you will.

00:09:56.859 --> 00:09:59.900
And I want you to notice the specifics.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.600
that Paul gives to the church at Ephesus.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.700
In Ephesians chapter number six,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.100
Paul goes through the end of the chapter

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.380
dealing with the spiritual battle that we're engaged in,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.880
and he talks about putting on the whole armor of God,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.240
and he comes to verse number 18,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.640
and he addresses the subject of prayer

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.280
to these believers at Ephesus,

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.660
and he says this in verse 18 of Ephesians six,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.920
praying always with all prayer and supplication

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.180
in the spirit, and watching thereunto

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.720
with all perseverance and supplication,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.760
then notice this, for all saints.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.360
All right, this is the request of, listen,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.260
as brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.060
we ought to be praying one for another, amen?

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.440
We ought to be upholding our brothers and sisters in prayer.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.100
We remember it's been a number of years now

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.640
since Holly and the girls would sing that song,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.160
but they would sing a wall of prayer.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.700
Oh man, what a powerful song,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.000
and how we need our brothers and sisters in Christ

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.340
to be praying for us, and he says for all saints,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.180
but then I want you to notice in verse number 19

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.640
that Paul then says, and for me.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.460
So Paul is going to get very specific

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.460
in verse 19 of Ephesians six

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.460
with regard to how he desired the believers in Ephesus here

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.080
to pray for him, and for me.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.420
Notice what he says, that utterance may be given unto me,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.960
that I may open my mouth boldly

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.660
to make known the mystery of the gospel,

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.000
for which I am an ambassador in bonds,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.840
Now, as we look at the request that Paul gives

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.000
to the believers in Ephesus,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.460
I almost kind of scratch my head and say,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.000
Paul is probably the most bold witness

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.380
that I can read of throughout the New Testament.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.820
I mean, he's a man that goes from place to place,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.400
and he enters into the city,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.460
and he goes right into the synagogues,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.700
and he begins to preach Christ,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.460
reasoning with them out of the scriptures,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.740
and I mean, he faces opposition,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.160
and he faces difficulty, and he just keeps on preaching.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.580
How does Paul have such boldness?

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.340
Well, we understand the Holy Spirit of God

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.740
gives us boldness, but I believe a great secret

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.540
to the boldness that Paul had in his ministry

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.340
was that he requested others to pray

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.040
that God would give them boldness.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.340
I think about the disciples in Acts chapter number four,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.000
when they're commanded not to teach or preach

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.340
in the name of Jesus any longer,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.640
they'd already been in prison,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.280
and they'd been threatened, and all of that,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.280
and they said they prayed that God would give them boldness,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.480
and if you look in the text of Scripture

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.920
in Acts chapter number four,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.320
you find that they pray for boldness,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.240
and then about a verse or two later,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.040
they're speaking boldly the gospel.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.040
Paul is a bold witness for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.580
but he makes the request specifically to others,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.260
to his brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.260
would you pray for me that I may open my mouth boldly,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.500
that I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.700
So guess what?

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.500
I think the believers in Ephesus

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.800
prayed that Paul would have boldness.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.920
It just kind of makes sense if someone asks you,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.980
would you pray for me specifically about this,

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.580
that you would pray about that.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.420
So we see that Paul had boldness.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.500
Notice in Colossians chapter number four,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.380
he's writing to this group of people,

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.260
this church in Colossae, as we often refer to it as,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.580
but you understand, the people in Ephesus knew Paul.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.800
Paul ministered in Ephesus for a lengthy period of time.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.580
When he writes back to the church at Ephesus,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.020
just as he does to the church at Philippi,

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.040
he ministered to both of those churches extensively.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.480
We find that Paul writing to the church in Thessalonica,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.800
it was a limited amount of time

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.580
that Paul ministered to the church in Thessalonica.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.160
The church at Colossae, they didn't know him,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.600
they never met him personally.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.560
Paul did not minister in Colossae.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.520
Paul heard about this church in Colossae,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.200
he heard about these believers,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.580
he heard about their faith and about their walk.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.880
We find that Paul did not know them personally.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.240
It was through Epaphras, really probably the pastor

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.600
at the church at Colossae,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.140
where Paul learned about these folks,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.520
but Paul extensively tells them in the first chapter,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.840
we don't have time to study it,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.640
but in the first chapter of the book of Colossians,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.240
he goes through how he's praying for them.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.060
People that he never met physically,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.000
that he never ministered to one-on-one,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.620
but he's praying for them.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.860
And then he says to them in Colossians chapter number four,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.240
in verse number two, continue in prayer,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.100
and watch in the same with thanksgiving.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.940
Then notice, with all praying also for us,

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.940
that God would open unto us a door of utterance

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.900
to speak the mystery of Christ,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.040
for which I am also in bonds,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.800
that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.300
Paul doesn't give any specifics

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.620
to the church in Thessalonica in the first letter

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.220
with regard to how to pray for them.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.620
He simply says, brethren, pray for us.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.500
It's a simple request.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.740
It's a sincere request.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.900
Listen, when you ask somebody to pray for you,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.220
you're sincere in your request.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.680
There's a burden that you're carrying.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.280
There's a challenge that you're facing.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.200
There's an uncertainty in your future.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.040
There's whatever the circumstance may be,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.080
and you come to somebody and say, would you pray for me?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.120
What are you revealing?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.920
Well, you're revealing that you believe in prayer.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.760
You're revealing that you believe

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.720
that God hears and answers prayer.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.200
I believe that you're revealing that you believe

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.220
the person that you're speaking to practices prayer.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.780
It'd be of no reason for me to ask somebody to pray for me

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.300
if I do not believe they're a person of prayer.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.500
It just wouldn't make any sense.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.180
But you ask someone to pray for you

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.100
because you believe that they believe in

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.700
and practice praying.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.620
Just makes sense.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.600
So we find this evening intercessory prayer,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.260
the simplicity of the request,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.760
the sincerity of the request.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.140
But number three, I want you to notice

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.100
the supplication of the recipients.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.500
When I speak of the recipients,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.580
I'm speaking of those in Thessalonica

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.900
that received the request.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.100
These ones that received the request,

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.900
brethren, pray for us,

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.540
and how is it that I could speak of this evening

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.580
of their supplication?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.600
Well, what do you do when someone asks you to pray for them?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.680
Do you pray for them?

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.520
I hope so.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.480
That's how we would respond.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.360
I'm supposed to say,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.880
would you pray for me about this situation?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.040
Now, there's a very practical aspect of this.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.360
I know I have, and I'm sure that

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.400
if you'd be honest tonight, you have as well,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.980
that someone's asked you to pray for them and you forgot.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.520
You failed to do so.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.700
Maybe you didn't jot it down.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.500
Maybe you didn't just,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.360
you thought you made that mental note,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.180
and you found out that you don't remember

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.520
as well as you used to, right?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.780
There was a, some of you might know his name.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.340
He's with the Lord now, Dr. Lee Roberson,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.260
a very well-known preacher.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.860
Number of years ago, had a just Tennessee temple.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.080
I mean, just a huge ministry college,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.360
produced a number of preachers and pastors and missionaries,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.480
a great man of God, and it was said of him,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.240
I only ever met him once or twice.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.559
He was probably close to 90 whenever I first met him,

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:47.000
and died shortly thereafter,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.440
but the reality is that it was said of that man,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.440
Dr. Lee Roberson, that anytime you'd ask him to pray for you

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.680
he would stop immediately, and he would pray for you.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600
Why did he do that?

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.619
Well, there's a huge ministry, a huge church,

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:04.700
lots of people, and a huge college, and lots of people,

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.100
and so he knew that there was no way he would remember

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.720
all of those people that had asked him

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.840
to pray about certain things,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.380
so he made it a habit in his life.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.220
I don't use the word habit in an inappropriate way

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.140
of it just being some religious exercise,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.940
but he made it a practice in his life

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.500
that if someone were to say,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.840
will you pray for me about this situation,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.680
he would stop right then, and he would pray for them.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.080
I think that's a good practice.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.840
The reality this evening is that

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.800
as I look at this portion of scripture,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.640
and I see this request,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.640
I believe that the second letter gives us insight

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
with regard to the supplication of these believers

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.080
in Thessalonica, the recipients of this request.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.780
Notice with me in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.780
if you will, in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.780
In verse number one, Paul says this,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.780
Finally, brethren, pray for us.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.780
That sounds awfully familiar to what we just read

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.780
in 1 Thessalonians 5.25.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.780
Brethren, pray for us.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.780
Here, it says, Finally, brethren, pray for us.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.780
But notice verse number one contains some specifics

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.780
with regard to how he's now asking

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.780
these believers to pray for him.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.780
That the word of the Lord may have free course

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.780
and be glorified even as it is with you.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.780
Now, if you were to understand what Paul is referring to

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.780
when he speaks about the word of the Lord

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.780
having free course and being glorified

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.780
even as it is with you,

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.780
he had said to this same group of people

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.780
back in the first letter that he wrote to them

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.780
in the second chapter, in verse number 13,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.780
he said that for this cause also thank we God

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.780
without ceasing because when ye received

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.780
the word of God which ye heard of us,

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.780
ye received it not as the word of men,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.780
but as it is in truth, the word of God

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:13.780
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.780
So, Paul is referring to the work

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.780
that God's word had in their lives

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.780
and he's saying that just as God's word

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.780
has been effective in your lives,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.780
I want you to pray that as I minister,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.780
as I take the word of God to other peoples

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.780
that God's word would have an impact

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.780
and an effect in their lives.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.780
We mentioned, I said it even this past week

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.780
on Sunday morning, how that we are evidence

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.780
that the gospel works.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.780
My life, your life this evening

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.780
has been transformed by the power of the gospel

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.780
and yet you have people today that say,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.780
well the gospel just doesn't work anymore,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.780
there's gotta be a new way,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.780
there's gotta be some more effective.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.780
No, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.780
We find this evening that as I look

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.780
at chapter three and verse number one

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.780
and I find that Paul is using these believers

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.780
as the example, look at how God's word

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.780
changed your lives.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.780
You think about the way in which

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.780
they had been transformed by the power

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.780
of God's word.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.780
What a joy.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.780
It says in First Thessalonians one in verse nine,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.780
you might want to just jot it down,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.780
but it says how you turn to God

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.780
from idols to serve the living and true God.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.780
Hallelujah.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.780
That's because the gospel, it's because

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.780
the word of God was preached and proclaimed

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.780
and it impacted, it affected them.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.780
So he continues in verse number two.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.780
In Second Thessalonians three, verse one,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.780
he talks about praying that the word of the Lord

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.780
would have free course and be glorified

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.780
even as it is with you.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.780
Verse two, and that we may be delivered

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.780
from unreasonable and wicked men

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.780
for all men have not faith.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.780
Wow.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.780
What a statement.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.780
The reality is that Paul knew what it was

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.780
to face opposition.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.780
Paul knew what it was, seemingly at every turn,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.780
to have someone or someones that were against him.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.780
In fact, it was so intense that even when

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.780
he was in Thessalonica, the reason that

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.780
he was there for such a short time

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.780
is because the people that were opposing him

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.780
followed after him.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.780
They would travel from one city to the next.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.780
Why? Because they were opposing the work

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.780
that Paul was doing, how God was using him.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.780
We find that he says he's praying for deliverance

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.780
from these unreasonable and wicked men

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.780
for all men have not faith.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.780
We understand even still today that we live

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.780
in a wicked, a perverse generation.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.780
We live, listen, Paul says this in the book

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.780
of Philippians that there are those

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.780
that are the enemies of the cross.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.780
They're in opposition.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.780
They stand against.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.780
So he prays for deliverance.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.780
Verse number three, but the Lord is faithful.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.780
Aren't you thankful?

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.780
We looked at that last week in 1 Thessalonians 5, 24.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.780
Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.780
We find he says that the Lord is faithful,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.780
and he is, praise God, who shall establish you

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.780
and keep you from evil.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.780
But then I want you to notice verse number four.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.780
And I spent all the time looking at those

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.780
first three verses, but I want you to see

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.780
that it's the climax, if you will,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.780
for this particular point of noticing

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.780
the supplication of the recipients.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.780
Notice what Paul says about these believers

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.780
in Thessalonica.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.780
He says, and we, we have confidence

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.780
in the Lord touching you.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:05.780
Notice that ye both do and will do

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.780
the things which we command you.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.780
Now, I'm not going to take the time this evening

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.780
to look at all the things that he commanded them,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.780
but I believe with regard to the subject

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.780
that we're studying this evening,

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.780
it's abundantly clear that one of the things

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.780
he commanded them to do was to pray.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.780
And so notice what Paul says.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.780
He says we have confidence.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.780
We have confidence in the Lord touching you

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:40.780
that ye both do and will do

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.780
the things which we command you.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.780
Don't you think that brought Paul great joy?

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.780
Knowing that the people that he was writing to,

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.780
the people that he was making this request to,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.780
a simple, sincere request.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.780
Brethren, pray for us that he had confidence

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.780
in knowing that they were going to do

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.780
and really, they already do and they will do

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.780
that which he has commanded them.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.780
I believe that Paul knew there were some believers

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.780
in Thessalonica that were engaged

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.780
in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.780
I believe that when Paul was facing

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.780
some of the difficulties that he faced,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.780
that God would encourage him

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.780
by knowing that there was an army of people

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.780
that were praying for him.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.780
It's amazing so often we'll get

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.780
update letters from our missionaries

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.780
and they'll say something like this.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.780
Your prayers are effective.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.780
We can sense and see how God is working.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.780
It's not to be spooky about it

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.780
or any kind of crazy thing about it,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.780
but the reality is that prayer works.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.780
Prayer works.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.780
In the ministry of intercessory prayer

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.780
is an amazing ministry.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.780
One of the things that's interesting is so often

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.780
we think about praying, if we're not careful,

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:12.780
prayer lives can consist more about me

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.780
and less about others.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.780
I've said before and it's not something

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.780
that I practice often, but I have done it

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.780
on a couple of different occasions

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.780
where I like to pray out loud regularly.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.780
That helps me stay on course.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.780
It helps me not get distracted.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.780
I'm talking to the Lord and he is present,

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.780
so it just helps me.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.780
But on a few occasions I've recorded myself praying

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.780
so that I could listen back to see

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.780
really the content of my prayers.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.780
You know it's far better for us to spend time

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.780
praying for others than being so consumed

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.780
about praying for ourselves.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.780
We find that as we engage in the ministry

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.780
of intercessory prayer, one thing that is certain

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.780
is that if we're going to engage in the ministry

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.780
of intercessory prayer, we need to know,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.780
and I don't mean in a nosy, inappropriate type

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.780
of a way, but we need to know what's going on

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.780
in the lives of our brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.780
If I'm going to pray, if I'm going to intercede

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.780
on your behalf, if I'm going to really

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.780
be that prayer warrior, I need to know

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.780
what I'm praying about.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.780
I've often said that God blessed them prayers,

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.780
I couldn't care less to have them.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.780
I don't know, you can't really substantiate the prayers.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.780
God just blessed this person and blessed that person

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.780
and blessed, I mean blessed them real good

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.780
if you get a little Southern in you, you know.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.780
What does that mean?

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.780
We end up beginning to pray specifically.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.780
We got a note this afternoon from Brother Dewey Whitfield,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.780
he'd been sharing with me throughout the week

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.780
about his wife's injury and the surgery that was upcoming

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.780
and not knowing exactly when they'd be able to have it

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.780
and we'd been praying throughout the week

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.780
and he sent me a text and said,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.780
brother, they just took her back and we were having dinner

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.780
and we stopped right then and just prayed.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.780
That's the unique privilege of prayer that at any time,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.780
at any moment, for any reason,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.780
and I was able to text him back and say,

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.780
brother, we prayed right now for your wife

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.780
and for this situation.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.780
What a unique, I'm not patting myself on the back,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.780
I'm simply saying that it's a unique privilege

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.780
that we can pray one for another

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.780
and be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.780
And you know, when we pray one for another,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.780
we see this more, I believe, in Acts 13 and 14

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.780
when you study that first missionary journey,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.780
the church at Antioch, no doubt,

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.780
was praying for the apostles.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.020
So Paul, as they went out, Paul and Silas commissioned,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.880
they go out, Paul and Barnabas, excuse me,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.340
commissioned and they go out.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.900
We find that as they would go on this missionary journey

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.900
that they travel to these cities,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.660
but then they come back to the church at Antioch

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.660
and they call the church together.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.860
And the Bible tells us in verse 27

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.340
that they rehearsed all that God had done with them.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.460
You know, I believe tonight,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.180
and I know I've preached from this passage of scripture

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.280
with regard to the first missions conference

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.380
of the local church,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.820
and I really believe that's what that was.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.800
And you find that there were some people

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.780
from the church at Antioch that were so excited

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.800
to be at that meeting,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.460
to hear everything that was being told to them

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.580
that God had done during that missionary journey.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.420
Why?

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.260
Because they were invested in prayer.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.820
They were praying.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.700
And through hearing what God did,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.200
you know what they were receiving?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.060
How God answered their prayers.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.740
How God worked.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.260
How God led along the way.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.660
And the people that were saved

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.420
and the churches that were established.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.340
And oh man, that caused people to rejoice.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.740
It's just like when we have prayer letters

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.480
from our missionaries.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.820
You know, when we have prayer letters

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.900
and we have opportunity to share the updates

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.220
and be able to share specific prayer requests,

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.220
and then when the missionaries send us another response,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.220
another letter, another update,

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.340
and they have follow-ups with regard to the things

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.380
that they had asked us to pray about,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.340
and then we get to see how God worked and what God did.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.180
You know what?

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.180
If you're counted among those that were praying for that,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.700
you rejoice greatly.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.440
Because God answered your prayer.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.740
Intercessory prayer.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.580
Brethren, pray for us.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.500
It's a simple request.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.540
It's a sincere request.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.460
But I believe that as we look at the next letter,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.940
we see the supplication of the recipients.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.860
They were people of prayer.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.120
They engaged in intercessory prayer.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.720
And through that, God worked and God blessed,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.100
and the ministry of the Apostle Paul went forward,

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.620
and people heard the gospel,

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.560
and people were saved

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.220
because there were some believers praying.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.660
What a blessing,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.260
to be engaged in the ministry of intercessory prayer.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.100
Let's pray together.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.620
Father, we love you.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.540
How we thank you for loving us.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.980
We thank you for the opportunity to study your word.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.820
We thank you, Lord,

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.340
for the opportunity to engage in prayer.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.240
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be people of prayer.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.580
God, that we would pray one for another

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.140
as you've commanded us to do so.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.220
Lord, I pray that you would bless

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.300
our remainder of our time this evening

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.660
as we receive these updates from our missionaries,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.220
as we rejoice in what you've done,

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.540
as we take note of how we should pray.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.580
I pray, Lord, that you'd be honored and glorified,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.580
and we'll thank you for it.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.340
In Christ's name we pray.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.180
Amen.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.100
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.260
You did not get one?
