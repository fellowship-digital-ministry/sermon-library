WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Genesis chapter number 17 this evening, Genesis chapter number 17, and we've been studying

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.439
through the book of Genesis for a lengthy period of time now.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.720
In fact, we started all the way back in Genesis chapter number 1 on March the 10th, 2019,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.799
almost two years ago.

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:23.639
And I'll be honest with you, I knew then what I do not know still now, and that is

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.239
how long it would take to get through the book of Genesis.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.200
And we spent a lengthy period of time dealing with creation and really dealing with the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.279
first 11 chapters of the book.

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:37.119
Over the last seven or eight weeks, we've dealt with various subject matters and have

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:42.000
not been in the book of Genesis, but I'm thankful for the opportunity to return this evening

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to the book of Genesis.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.959
And as we return to our study, we're going to look here at chapter number 17, and really

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.439
just looking at verse number 1.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:56.900
I want you to notice the Bible says this, and when Abram was 90 years old and nine,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:06.300
the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.620
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.980
As we look at this passage of Scripture, we find that here when the Lord says, I am the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.620
Almighty God, that this is the name El Shaddai.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.860
And we find that God, of course, uses throughout the Word of God various names to describe

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.180
himself to help us understand more about who he is and what he is able to do.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.220
And here in this passage of Scripture, we find this great truth that is revealed to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.220
us.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.220
It is the first mention of that name El Shaddai in all of the Old Testament.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.779
We find that the name El Shaddai, the Almighty One, will be used nearly 50 times throughout

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:48.779
the Old Testament.

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:52.900
We find a number of those times in the book of Job, during the dialogue between Job and

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
his friends.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.339
But we find here that God is speaking to Abram, and he says, I am the Almighty God.

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:05.660
And you think about this truth, and you think about the impact that this truth would have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.660
upon Abram.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.860
It reminds me of what we have studied in weeks gone by.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.139
You'll remember back in Genesis chapter number 15, if you know in verse number 1, the Bible

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:20.660
references after these things, and the things that are referenced, of course, are the battles

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.740
that took place in chapter number 14, and the way in which Abram was used of God to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.779
rescue Lot and others.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:31.259
We find that the Bible says that the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:38.839
not, Abram, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.899
We find that as we looked at that passage of Scripture to begin Genesis chapter number

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:48.500
15, that I mentioned, and actually I believe that I titled the message, A Memorable Greeting.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.020
The way in which the greeting that is recorded here in Genesis 15 would have such an impact

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.179
upon Abram, and how perfectly timed this truth was to Abram, as God would once again reveal

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.419
to Abram aspects about who he is.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.460
We find that in chapter number 16, of course, the birth of Ishmael is recorded.

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:14.779
It is interesting because as you end chapter number 16, the Bible says that Abram was fourscore

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:15.779
and six years old.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.899
He was 86 at the end of chapter number 16.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:25.899
And yet as we begin chapter number 17, the Bible says that he was 90 years old, and nine,

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.699
13 years had passed.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:35.139
During those 13 years, as far as we know from a biblical perspective, there's no record

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.779
that has been given to us of any interaction, any speaking from God to Abram.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.539
It's just not even mentioned.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:49.979
We find that these 13 years pass and now the Lord is going to appear to Abram, and we think

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:55.619
about this particular greeting and the impact of that one in chapter number 15, and now

00:03:55.619 --> 00:04:00.820
we come to chapter number 17, and how perfectly, of course, our God does all things well.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.179
His timing is always perfect, but the impact of this particular greeting with regard to

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.580
all that was going on in the life of Abram.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.899
We find that it was there in chapter number 14 of the book of Genesis in which Abram has

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:23.420
an encounter with the king of Salem, Melchizedek, and you'll remember that that meeting that

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.100
he had with Melchizedek, the king of Salem, that really the king of Salem was able to

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.179
meet Abram and speak with him before the king of Sodom was able to go and speak with him.

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:44.899
And as the king of Salem, Melchizedek, would meet with Abram, he says to Abram, he reveals

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:52.700
to Abram one of the names of God, El Elyon, that God is the most high God.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.540
It's so impactful because Abram receives that truth, that revelation, and then the king

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.540
of Sodom would come and seek to offer Abram a certain reward for that which had been accomplished

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.019
in giving victory and bringing back the spoils.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:18.299
But Abram now knew that God, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and of earth,

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:22.220
that he was going to serve the Lord God.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.899
And here in chapter number 17, God is going to once again package for us, as we would

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:33.019
refer to it as the Abrahamic covenant, and as we go through the entirety of chapter number

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:40.579
17 and find once again this Abrahamic covenant, that God is going to at least on ten occasions

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:46.779
the phrase, I will, is mentioned in Genesis 17.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.459
That God is speaking.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.019
God says, I will do this.

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:53.700
I will do this.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.339
When you think about the impact of God revealing to Abram before God even gets into all of

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:09.380
the specifics and saying what He will do, He says, I am the Lord God Almighty.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.380
I am the Almighty God.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380
El Shaddai.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.339
If you're taking notes, I've simply titled the message this evening, El Shaddai.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:20.779
And as we look at this passage of Scripture and we think about what God declares, if you're

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.140
taking notes, number one, notice what God declares.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.140
It's revelation.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.140
And we find that as we would look at the Word of God and see the revelation and how God

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.059
seeks to reveal Himself to His people, and I'm so thankful that today, even as we mentioned

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.899
multiple times this morning during our message as we've studied through the book of Colossians,

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:42.480
that we have the Word of God.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.940
And with having the Word of God, we have the perfect revelation and we have the truth that

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.100
God wants us to have.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.779
And here, God would say to Abram as He would appear, you notice that the Bible says when

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:02.660
Abram was 90 and 9 years old, that the Lord appeared to Abram.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.059
Can you imagine as God would appear to him?

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:10.700
And again, for 13 long years, 13 years is a long period of time.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.519
As best we know, there's no God appearing to Abram during that period of time.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:24.920
And here, the Lord appears to Abram and the Lord says, I am the Almighty God.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.640
What a greeting.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.760
What a declaration.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.940
As God is declaring to Abram who He is, and we think this evening as we would be mindful

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.880
of understanding who God is, we would find that as I've mentioned by way of introduction

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.799
that this name of God, El Shaddai, is the first time in which it is used in all of the

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:45.799
Old Testament.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.760
It carries with it the idea of being the Most Powerful.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.160
It carries with it of being the All-Sufficient One.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.179
And we find that our God is able to do all things.

00:07:56.179 --> 00:08:02.320
We would understand, as Paul would say to the believers in Ephesus, the reality that

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.480
as we pray and seek the face of God, that we're praying to the One that is able to do

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.839
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:15.760
There are times in our lives in which we might face difficulties and trials and hardships

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.760
and we think that it's beyond hope and that there's nothing that can be done.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.320
The circumstances are what they are.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.040
But we serve El Shaddai, the Almighty God, who is able to do all things.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.839
There's nothing too hard for Him.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:32.599
By the way, we find that it's in Genesis chapter number 18.

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:36.679
I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but it's there in Genesis chapter number 18.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:42.159
It's recorded in verse number 14 when God says to Abraham, His name is changed in chapter

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:48.919
17, and He says this, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:53.359
Aren't you thankful that God revealed Himself as El Shaddai, the Almighty God, prior to

00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:55.719
asking that question?

00:08:55.719 --> 00:09:00.559
He's revealing Himself to Abram and saying, Abram, I want you to understand who I am.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:05.599
I want you to understand what I'm capable of doing and all of these I-wills that I'm

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:14.320
going to give you, that I am capable of fulfilling those because I am the Almighty God.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.440
You know, God has a plan for the ages.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.320
He gives us the Word of God.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.239
He gives us prophecy.

00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:25.679
We can study the Old Testament, we can study the New Testament and see many references

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:26.679
to prophecies.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:31.539
You study the book of Revelation and you see the end times calendar, if you will.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:37.099
You understand that there's nothing that will cause the plan of God to not go into

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:38.099
effect.

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:43.820
God's plan will be worked out because He is the Almighty God.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.979
And we find here that as Abram, His name will be changed in just a few verses, but we find

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:54.460
here that His name is still Abram and we would understand the impact.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.539
And I wonder this evening as I would think about this particular passage of Scripture

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:00.340
and I would think...

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:07.260
about this greeting. Can you imagine being Abram? Can you imagine God appearing

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:14.260
to you and saying, I am the Almighty God? What a great introduction. Have you ever

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.980
met anyone? You've never met them before and you're gonna meet them for the very

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.520
first time and they tell you who they are. And maybe it's somebody that you had

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.900
longed to meet, someone of some prominence, of some stature, of some

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.540
position, and you meet that individual and you're thankful for the opportunity

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.620
to have met them. God says to Abram, I am the Almighty God.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.900
El Shaddai. And I wonder this evening as I consider the impact that this must

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.180
have had upon Abram, I wonder this evening in his days ahead in his life as

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.060
he would go through a number of more years of living, I wonder how often he

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:01.100
was mindful of the way in which God greeted him. I wonder how impactful that

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.280
truth that he's the Most High God, El Elyon. I wonder how often the truth when

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.620
God said, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. I wonder when he

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.260
says, I am the Almighty God, how did this impact Abram? But a far better question

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.940
for us this evening is how does it impact you? How does it impact me? When we

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.060
take the Word of God and we read the truth that God has given and we begin to

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:34.060
seek to apply God's Word in our lives, do we understand that the promises that He

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.340
has given us and the truth that He has revealed to us is certain, it stands, it

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:45.780
will not be overthrown. Why? Because of who He is. Because of who He is. You know

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:53.060
God wants you to know who He is. This book reveals God to us. The Lord Jesus

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.060
Christ, of course God in flesh, manifested God to man and we find that

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.860
as we study the Word of God and as we dig in and we begin to gather this

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.380
information, the reality is that I'm never going to fully understand God and

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.900
all of His wonder. I'm simply going to stand in awe of Him. And the same is true

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:20.340
of you. Why? Because He transcends us. His ways are not our ways. His thoughts are

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.700
not our thoughts. But He has given us this book so that we know about Him and

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.620
we know what He wants us to know about Him and He uses these names and this

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.660
evening as we think about this revelation, this declaration of what God

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.660
is declaring and giving this truth to Abram, I believe it must have had an

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:46.700
impact in his life. But for us this evening, how often do we go through life

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:53.020
facing challenges and difficulties and uncertainties? How often are we mindful

00:12:53.020 --> 00:13:00.900
of the fact, I serve the Almighty God. He's the Almighty One. He's El Shaddai.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:08.580
There's nothing too hard for Him. When God will ask Abraham that question

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.860
in just another chapter, is anything too hard for me?

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.540
Abraham's already, it's kind of a setup question so to speak, you know what I

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.500
mean? Because God's already said, I'm the Almighty God. And then He says, is anything

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.460
too hard for me? Well, no. You've already told me that you're the Almighty God. In

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.540
your life, in my life, He's the Almighty God. He is, as the book of Revelation says,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:40.060
the Lord God Omnipotent. And He reigns and He rules. I remember speaking with

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.500
somebody a number of years ago, and as I was sharing the gospel with this

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.180
individual, they began to share with me about a relative of theirs that claimed

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.180
to be an atheist. And it really was just using it as a diversion tactic so that

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.260
the attention would get off of the conversation that I was having with them

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.820
as to their need for Christ. And they were seeking to just, you know, use this

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.980
distraction and diversion, if you will, so that we could talk about someone else.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:09.060
And they said, you know, you could never convince them of this truth. And I said

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.380
something like this to the individual, it's not my duty to convince them. That's

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:20.060
the work of God. And God is the Almighty Omnipotent One that can do all things.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.420
There's nothing too hard for Him. And as God would reveal this to Abram in

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:32.620
Genesis 17.1, I hope this evening that we, in 2021, as we're living and dealing

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.500
with the uncertainties of life and dealing with the trials that vary from

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.940
pew to pew within our congregation, that we would be mindful this evening that we

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.300
serve the Almighty God. And there's nothing too hard for Him. You say, well,

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.420
you just don't know, Pastor. You don't know this situation. You don't know that.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.940
The reality is that we got to know who God is. And we have faith that God is

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:04.060
able. That God is able. We need to meditate upon who our God is and truly

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.180
allow the revelation that He's given us in His Word with regard to who He is and

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.860
what He's capable of doing. We need to allow it to impact our lives. No doubt in

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.300
my life, or in my mind, as you read through the words of Scripture, you

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.540
read through the pages of God's Word, and you read of some individuals that we

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:29.020
might tonight refer to as being heroes of the faith. Perhaps the ones that you

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.420
could go to and read of their lives in Hebrews chapter number 11, and you can

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.940
read of some of those great wonders that took place. You know, those individuals

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:45.180
understood something about who God is. They understood what God was able to do.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:51.540
I mentioned this morning about David in 1 Samuel 17. He knew something about

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:58.420
God, did he not? He knew what God was able to do. He had proven himself to David on

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:04.340
multiple occasions. And David had some knowledge, and he had some belief, he had

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:10.100
some faith that God was able. As we look at Genesis 17 and verse number 1, we

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.540
notice what God declares. Number 2, we notice what God demands. And so that's

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:20.700
strong language. Well, the Bible says this, I am the Almighty God. Look at the

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:30.340
last phrase in verse 1. Walk before me and be thou perfect. Walk before me and

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:36.380
be thou perfect. If we would say that the declaration of God is revelation, we

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.300
would say that the demand that is mentioned at the end of verse number 1

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.780
is responsibility. The reality is that the verb that is used here, walk, we find

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.420
that in the original that it would be a verb that is an imperative. It is a

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.860
demand, a command, if you will. And God is giving this command. He says, walk before

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.420
me. We've understood as we've studied the book of Genesis that there are some that

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.940
are noted as being those that walked with God. You'll be mindful of Enoch. Enoch

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.420
walked with God. Is that not what the scriptures tell us? And he was not, for

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.900
God took him. He was translated. And in an amazing portion of scriptures, you read

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.340
in the early page of the book of Genesis, and you begin to understand this great

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.020
translation that took place with Enoch being translated

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.980
from earth to heaven and given to us there in

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:36.220
chapter number 5. And Enoch walked with God. And then in chapter number 6,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:42.700
you'll remember that there's a man by the name of Noah. And Noah, as God is

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.740
giving us the condition of the world and the wickedness of the world and all that

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.500
was taking place, and the fact that God was going to destroy man whom he had

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.340
created, the Bible says that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. And the

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.140
Bible tells us that he was a just man and perfect in his generations. And Noah

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:09.780
walked with God. Enoch walked with God. Noah walked with God. And here we find

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:17.580
that God is speaking to Abram and he says, I am the Almighty God. Walk before

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:26.740
me and be thou perfect. The idea of be thou perfect, it has this idea, and it's

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.700
absolutely true, that it's this idea of having a complete walk with God. In other

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:37.460
words, not being double-minded. Completely, entirely. It's not carrying with it the

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.700
idea. Sometimes we think about perfect and perfection and we think about this idea

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.059
of sinless perfection, that I'm going to be perfect. But the reality is that so

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:53.220
long as we have this flesh, so long as we live upon this earth, there's going to be

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.540
sin, and I'm thankful that we have an advocate with the Father. Amen? But the

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.220
reality is that here he's speaking about this completeness and the idea that

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.980
you're going to walk before Him, before God. Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:15.180
Completely, wholly, without division. No double-mindedness. As I look at this

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.500
passage of Scripture and think about here what God is really demanding and what

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.460
the responsibility is of Abram. He's received this revelation and now there's

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.980
this responsibility that is given. And by the way, I will say this, the Bible says

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:36.580
to whom much is given, much is required. When God makes revelation, when He gives

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.980
truth to His people, He expects that His people would respond in obedience. The

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.700
Bible says that we're to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. We allow the

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.220
truth of the Word of God to impact and influence our lives. And here, as God

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.580
would reveal to Abram that He is the Almighty God, El Shaddai, that no doubt it

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.300
should have the result, the response of

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.100
with Abram walking with God,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.320
walking before Him.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.360
This evening, as we think about this truth

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.000
and I wonder about Abram and his life,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.180
and I wonder about that which had been

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.320
given to him and revealed to him,

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.560
and I begin to think about our own lives

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.220
and think about that which God has revealed to us,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.520
I wonder this evening if we've ever had

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.560
some folks that have asked us some questions

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.040
about maybe our walk with God.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.020
Does anyone ever ask you why you do the things you do?

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.580
Why do you go to church?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.240
Why is it that you...

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.160
I mean, you went to church this morning.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.880
You've got to go back tonight?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.920
People don't really sometimes understand.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.300
They don't comprehend.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.360
They begin to wonder and maybe they begin to think

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.000
why is it that you have this desire,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.720
this need to serve God?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.840
Why is it that you do these things

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.100
and so on and so forth

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.060
and we could go through all sorts of examples

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.740
and illustrations this evening

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.780
as to what someone might ask.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.680
But the reality is that when I understand

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.200
who God is and I understand what He's done for me,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.700
out of an appreciation for who He is

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.800
and what He's done,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.220
I want to walk before Him.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.680
And I want to serve Him.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.600
And I want to please Him.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.900
I believe that as you look at this passage of Scripture,

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.060
certainly it carries with it the idea

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.700
walk before me and be thou perfect

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.740
and it would have this complete walk,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.180
this wholehearted walk.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.820
God's not interested in half-heartedness.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.940
He wants all of you.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.620
He wants all of me.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.500
Aren't you thankful that He paid it all

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.300
on the cross of Calvary?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.420
I mean, what would we be,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.260
where would we be if He paid for like 90% of it?

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.340
It'd be a difficult situation, would it not?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.860
But He paid it all.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.660
Paul says, I'm bought with a price

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.380
in 1 Corinthians 6.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.340
And I believe this evening that as we

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.980
look at this passage of Scripture

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.340
and think about this truth of being holy

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.900
and completely get in, if you will,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.180
and follow the Lord, walk with Him,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.620
we find also that it can carry with it

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.340
that idea of the impact

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.580
that walking with God would have in our lives.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.220
As we walk with Him, as we sup with Him,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.460
as we commune with Him.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.300
You remember this morning,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.140
we looked at a passage in Revelation 3,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.340
you don't need to turn there,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.940
but remember it was in verse number 20

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.060
when he says that I stand at the door

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.700
and knock, if any man hear my voice

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.580
and open the door, I will come into him

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.220
and he, excuse me, and will sup with him

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.020
and he with me.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.420
That fellowship that we can have with God

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.580
as we walk with Him.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.860
This idea of be thou perfect,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.580
the idea of being complete,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.780
and we understand our theme

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.900
as we've studied through the book of Colossians this year,

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.060
to be complete in Christ.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.100
Complete in Him.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.580
Complete in Thee as we sing the song.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.180
And we find that as we look at this truth

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.540
and begin to understand the days ahead

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.580
and the events that will transpire

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.900
in the life of Abram

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.620
and this impact of this truth

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.860
of who God is,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.500
what He declares and then what He demands.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.140
I have found in my life

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.660
that when someone will ask me a question

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.860
about my walk with God

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.820
or my desire to serve God,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.980
I typically would be able to acknowledge

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.700
that the individual that's asking the question

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.660
really does not have a full understanding

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.220
of who our God is.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.740
This evening, we find that God makes this declaration,

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.620
but then He gives this demand to Abram.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.740
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.620
You know, the reality is that our walk with God matters.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.060
Our walk with God matters.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.940
By the way, I hope this evening

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.100
you would understand and desire to walk with Him.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.340
To walk before Him.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.820
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.020
We're gonna do a jump from here

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.220
in this truth in Genesis

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.580
and look over the book of Ephesians

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.060
and make some application for the New Testament believer

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.460
from this portion of Scripture.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.740
There are really several chapters here

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.660
in the book of Ephesians.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.580
Quickly, just overviewing this principle

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.660
and this truth with regard to our walk with God.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.860
If you understand the book of Ephesians,

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.740
and two years ago, it was in 2019

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.060
that I preached through the book of Ephesians

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.540
on our Sunday morning services,

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.340
but if you understand the book of Ephesians,

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.220
you'll find it in the first three chapters

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.260
of the book of Ephesians

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.620
that God is establishing

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.780
through the Apostle Paul

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.620
to these believers in Ephesus

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.740
their position in Christ.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.860
He begins in the first chapter

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.700
speaking about their redemption,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.060
speaking about their salvation.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.460
He begins teaching them and sharing with them

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.980
the fact that God has a plan of redemption.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.020
By the way, aren't you thankful

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.900
that God has a plan of redemption?

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.580
He then reveals to the people in Ephesus

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.060
that there's a price for redemption.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.460
And that price is the precious blood of Christ.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.700
Aren't you thankful that He paid the price?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.060
And then He deals with the proof of redemption

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.300
that He gives us the Holy Spirit of God

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.820
that we're sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.900
that He is the earnest of our inheritance.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.660
What a joy. What a blessing.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.980
What a joy to know that we belong to Him,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.940
that we are secure in Christ,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.980
that we are kept by the power of God as Peter says.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.580
We find that He deals with

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.380
in the second chapter of the book of Ephesians

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.300
the truth that we're saved by grace through faith.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.500
That we're not saved by our good works.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.020
In fact, all of our good works,

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.940
according to what Isaiah said, are as filthy rags.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.860
There's nothing I can do,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.220
not by works of righteousness, which we have done,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.100
but according to His mercy, He hath begotten us.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.060
We find here Ephesians 2, 8, and 9,

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.100
familiar verses of Scripture,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.820
for by grace are you saved through faith

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.980
and that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.420
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.220
I spoke with a young man just this past week,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.660
shared Christ with this individual,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.620
began to talk to him about his need for the Savior,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.620
and shared with him the price of sin, the penalty for sin,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.660
and talked to him about how the Lord Jesus Christ

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.060
paid it with His precious blood.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980
And he looked at me and he said,

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.580
well, there's just gotta be something that I have to do.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.460
I mean, I have to be a good person.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.260
I have to do some good things.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.740
I said, sir, with all due respect,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.660
there's nothing you can do to get to heaven.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.580
You remember the truth of the book of Colossians,

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.020
as we've been studying through that book this year,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.140
that the Bible tells us in Colossians chapter number one,

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.180
that He hath made us meet to be partakers

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.180
of the inheritance of the saints in light.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.300
In verse number 12, that word meet

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.500
means that He's made us qualified.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.860
I can't make myself qualified for heaven.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.580
There's no good work that I could do

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.180
to be qualified for heaven.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.380
And so God is using the apostle Paul

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.220
to share with these believers in Ephesus

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.700
in chapter number two of this book,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.940
the fact that they are saved by grace through faith.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.180
And as we look at these first three chapters

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.740
and deal with in chapter three,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.780
Paul's gonna pray for them and share with them

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.540
the truth of the church and what have you.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.180
But as we look at these three chapters

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.180
of the book of Ephesians,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.980
really what God is doing is He is helping these believers

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.340
to understand their position in Christ.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.180
Who am I in Christ?

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.300
I'm a child of the King.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.500
I'm a son of God.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.300
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.540
But as many as received Him,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.700
to them gave He power to become the sons of God.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.420
I'm a child of the King.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.940
I've been adopted.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.940
He's my Father.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.260
Remember on Wednesday evenings

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.700
as we're studying through Luke 11,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.740
and looking at the instruction that Jesus gives

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.380
as the disciple says, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.220
And Jesus looks to all of the disciples and says,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.740
when you pray, say, our Father.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.820
We studied two weeks ago,

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.380
really just spent a bunch of time

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.820
dealing with that simple phrase,

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.100
our Father, which art in heaven.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.860
He is the God of the universe,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.580
but because of Calvary, because of redemption,

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.300
He's my Father.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.860
And I have access to the throne room of heaven

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.940
because of this relationship that I have with God.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.420
That's what God is establishing in Ephesians 1-3,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.580
your position in Christ.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.740
I hope this evening that you know

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.300
that you're a child of God,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.740
that you've trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.180
that you have 100% assurance

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.500
that if you die tonight, that heaven is your home.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.740
These things have I written unto you

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.260
that believe in the name of the Son of God,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.420
that you may know that you have eternal life.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.020
And I'm so thankful for the truth that God gives us.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.820
As you enter into chapters four, five, and six,

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.580
the book becomes much more practical.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.140
Really, those first three chapters

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.020
deal with some doctrinal things and deal with this truth.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.380
And as we get to chapters four, five, and six,

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.980
it's the outworking, the practical aspect of our salvation.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.460
Now that we've established who we are in Christ,

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.820
we've established our position in Christ,

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.260
we find that Paul begins chapter number four

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.860
in verse number one, and he says,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.100
I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.980
beseech you that ye walk worthy

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.900
of the vocation wherewith ye are called.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.020
This is the first of five mentions

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.140
in the book of Ephesians about the walk of a believer.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.300
And we find that it would be summarized

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.020
by this statement, walk worthy.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.140
And you find in here in Ephesians four,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.300
in verse number one, that it's important that we

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:06.400
understand that Paul is not saying to these believers that this is the way in which you

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400
get saved.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:13.820
No, no, that's already been established, that's already settled in chapters 1-3.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:20.740
Nor is he saying to these believers, this is how you stay saved.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:27.780
Rather he's saying because you are saved, walk worthy.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:33.880
Because of our relationship with Jesus Christ, because we are a child of the King, it should

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.800
impact how I walk.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:44.920
You know, the reality is that we shouldn't get mad at sinners for sinning.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
They're born sinners.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.920
You were born a sinner, I was born a sinner.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.380
We're going to give them the truth of the gospel.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:31:01.420
But because we are saved, we are to have a walk that is worthy, that is pleasing to God.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.500
God says to Abram, I am the Almighty God.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.940
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:12.140
As God would give revelation, He has to make this declaration to Abram as to who He is.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.180
He then makes this demand, what is the responsibility of this knowledge that you now have and this

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:22.360
truth of walking with Him and we as the people of God as we make the New Testament application

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.200
and what great position we have to know the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.120
Our walk matters to God.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.720
He's concerned about our walk.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.720
Walk worthy.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.560
Number two, he says this in verse number 17 of the same chapter in Ephesians 4 and verse

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.280
17, this I say therefore in testifying the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.480
Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.480
Why would you not walk as other Gentiles?

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.960
Because you've been saved.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.480
Because you've been adopted in the family of God.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.040
And so therefore remember the truth that Paul shares with the believers in Corinth, therefore

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.520
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.640
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.920
And so we sing the song with the children in Sunday school and junior church and vacation

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.680
Bible school, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680
Why?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.080
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.120
The things I used to say, the places I used to go, I mean, you fill in all the verses

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.280
that you sing with those kids and you just rejoice in understanding that there's been

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.440
a great change since I've been born again.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.920
And so he says, listen, don't walk as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.680
He'll go through in the next several, really all the way to the end of the chapter of Ephesians

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.360
chapter number four, giving illustration of what that means.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.600
Stop lying.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.000
Stop stealing.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.960
I mean, it's what he says.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960
Why?

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.360
Because you're different.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360
Things are different now.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360
I've been saved.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.880
I've been born again.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.480
He says in verse number 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation, the old

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:10.240
man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.800
mind and that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800
true holiness.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.480
This is a truth of God's word of putting off and putting on.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.480
Putting off the old man, putting on the new man.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:31.040
Again, Paul is not saying to these believers in Ephesus that they are to do these things

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.480
to get saved or to remain saved.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.200
No, he's saying because of your position in Christ.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.800
The third aspect is found in chapter five in verse number one.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.880
Really in verse number two it says, be ye therefore followers of God as your children.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.160
Notice verse two, and walk in love.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160
Walk in love.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.640
What did Jesus say in John 13?

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:57.000
He said that we're to love as Christ loved.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.440
By this shall all men know that you're my disciples.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.160
Paul speaking to the believers in Thessalonica, he says to them, he says, listen, you know

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.400
how to have charity, you know how to love the brethren, and I encourage you, I exhort

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.040
you to increase more and more.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.360
What a joy to know the love of God and then to show the love of God.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.320
To walk in love.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.180
To walk in love.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:30.800
We find that as we continue to study through the book of Ephesians and deal with these

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.320
truths that we find that we come to verse number eight and the Bible says this in Ephesians

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:40.000
five and verse number eight, for ye were sometimes darkness.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.720
But now are ye light in the Lord.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.840
Walk as children of light.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.880
I remember when I was lost.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.360
I remember when I did not know Christ as my Savior.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.080
Some of you remember that as well.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.920
Some of you are saved at a young age and you do not remember walking in darkness.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.920
But there are some among us that remember what it was to walk in darkness.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.400
We understand that great transformation that took place and Paul says this is what you

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.880
were but this is what you are.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.640
Aren't you thankful for that change?

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.640
I'm thankful that I'm no longer in darkness, that I've been born again.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.560
He's really referencing what he says in chapter number two there about the fact that we've

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.320
been quickened, we've been made alive.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.000
We were dead in our sins and our trespasses and so on and so forth and now he says to

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.440
these believers here in chapter five and verse number eight, walk as children of light.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:46.480
Again, not to get saved or to stay saved but because you are saved, walk in this manner.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.960
The final reference, Ephesians chapter number five and verse number 15.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:01.880
The Bible says this, see then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:09.080
We understand really the imagery of this verse of Scripture and the truth of walking circumspectly

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.000
and we understand that there is much that is going on around us and the importance of

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.080
us having discernment and being vigilant and remember that Peter would say to the believers

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.480
that he's writing to in the book of 1 Peter that were to be sober, be vigilant.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480
Why?

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:32.160
Because your enemy, your adversary as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.840
This importance of walking circumspectly.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.760
You ever watch somebody walk and they're not paying attention?

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.200
Have you ever walked and not paid attention?

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.040
I'm sure that many of us have received the email video of the guy walking into a pole

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.400
because he was on his cell phone and we've gotten lots of laughs at his expense.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.440
Perhaps you've seen the individual driving in northern Virginia while they're looking

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.920
at their phone and they're completely distracted.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.360
They're not looking where they're going.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:10.640
As believers, we need to walk circumspect, being vigilant, being aware of our surroundings

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.600
and what's going on, looking for those traps that the enemy would like to set.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.400
As we think about these truths and we understand what Paul is saying to the believers in Ephesus

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.080
and take the application for our own lives and we begin to understand this evening that

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.200
our walk matters to God.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.700
I can't expect a lost person to walk with God.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.480
The first step is to be born again.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.120
But after salvation, God is interested in our walk.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:47.160
And it's not so that we get saved or stay saved, it's because we are saved.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.400
I'm not sure if any of you ever had a parent tell you or maybe for the parents that are

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.800
in the room this evening, you've said to your children that they represent the family name.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.760
Hey, be on your best behavior.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.240
Maybe somebody says something like this to a child, maybe your parents said to you, don't

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.240
embarrass me.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.440
What do you mean by that?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.300
Hey, listen, we're going somewhere, you better not be an embarrassment to me.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.820
I heard someone say, don't embarrass me because I'll embarrass you.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.860
I'm thankful that I don't know how that all worked out because neither one embarrassed

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.860
either of the other.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:27.340
But the reality is that we're the children of the king, we're the people of God, we behave

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.100
a certain way and walk a certain way.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.020
And if you go back to the book of Genesis in the 17th chapter and the passage which

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:38.500
we're studying just to really as an introductory to the entire chapter that we're going to

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.900
study in the next couple of Sunday evenings, we find that God is giving, He's making this

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:52.740
declared statement of who He is and then He says to Abram, walk before Me and be thou

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.900
perfect.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:01.780
This idea of having this complete, single-minded, no double-mindedness, wholehearted walk with

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.860
God.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:12.860
Because of that which has been revealed to us, we too should walk with God.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.180
We should desire to walk with Him, to really know Him.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.060
Paul says that I may know Him in the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:26.820
sufferings being made conformable unto His death in Philippians 3 and verse number 10.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:33.140
This evening, as we think about this passage of Scripture, really this verse of Scripture,

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:39.100
I wonder this evening, how often do you meditate upon who God is?

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.500
I understand that we're living in the time of great chaos.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.740
A lot of things going on in our world today.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:55.460
And if we're not careful, we can begin to think that maybe God isn't in control.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.580
Maybe things are kind of falling apart.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.340
I've said to a number of people recently on the...

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.640
phone that really the best way to describe, I believe, biblically speaking, as you look

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.520
at the biblical timeline, is not to say things are falling apart, but things are falling

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.160
in place.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160
Things are falling in place.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:19.560
When you think about the timeline, the eschatology that God gives us in His Word and the timeline

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.240
of future events, you begin to see how things are falling in place.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.160
There's a huge push in our world today for a one-world government.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.640
Have you read Revelation 16 through 18?

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.200
Yeah, it's going to happen at some point.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.520
The Antichrist, it's going to happen.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.960
I don't know when it's going to be, but I wonder that in the midst of all of the chaos

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.720
and all of the confusion and all the things that are going on, how often do we spend,

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.920
how much time do we spend really meditating upon who God is?

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.600
Maybe just get alone with God and His Word and just looking up the names of God, as we

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:05.780
find here in Genesis 17.1, El Shaddai, the Almighty God, and just spend some time meditating

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.040
upon that truth.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.360
What does this mean?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:16.800
How does this apply in my life, in these circumstances, in this situation?

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.600
Is God really able?

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600
Yes!

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.240
A hundred times, yes!

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.120
We serve the Lord God Almighty.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.240
I referenced already Ephesians 3.20, unto Him that is able to do exceeding and abundantly

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.060
above all that we ask or think.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.000
You know, God works in amazing ways.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.940
I wish I could share with you the specifics of a prayer request that was answered this

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:46.120
week in a very distinct, I mean, amazing way.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.120
You say, God is able.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.620
He's able.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.000
God is able to do all things.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Why?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.240
Because He's the Almighty God.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:01.200
And He's going to say to Abram, I will do this, and I will do that, and I will bring

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.120
this to pass.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.000
There are certainly times in our lives that we make declarative statements such as that.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.320
Have you ever told somebody, I will meet you tomorrow at this time?

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.000
Do you know that with all of your best intentions, there are things that could come up that would

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.580
prevent you from being able to do that?

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:30.100
You might be dead before that time, just being very direct about it, right?

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.180
But when God says, I will, He's God.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.460
He's the Almighty One.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.660
He will.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:44.920
How often do we really spend some time meditating upon how God has revealed Himself to us?

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:51.760
And then I'll ask this question, how's our walk with God?

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.720
Not how do we present our walk with God to be.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:05.600
See, the reality is that there are times in our lives where we know how to give the right

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.360
answers.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:16.160
The reality is that on the outward, people can look like they have it all together, but

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.200
on the inside, they could be falling apart.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:26.960
I heard a man, I do not know the man personally, I know the man that was speaking with this

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960
individual.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.440
He was a pastor up in New England.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:37.480
He was a pastor of a church, but he was invited really to do the work of what an evangelist

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.960
would typically do and hold some special meetings in this other church.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.760
As he went and held those special meetings in this other church on a Monday and Tuesday

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:54.260
evening, he and his wife, along with the pastor of that church and his wife, went out to eat.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.720
When you went to that church, you would really think that the pastor had it all together,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.880
so to speak.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.340
That pastor said to that visiting pastor, can I talk to you separate from our wives

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.420
for just a few minutes?

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:15.020
As they had this conversation over at another table, he revealed to this pastor just how

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.020
far he had gotten from God.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.900
It began to pour his heart out to this pastor.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.060
He said to this pastor, I haven't read my Bible in a year.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.780
I don't know how you could be a pastor and not read your Bible in a year, but that's

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.820
what he said.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.940
But you know, the reality is that nobody in his congregation, and probably not that

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.340
visiting pastor from his own admission, would have ever known that that man had not read

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.660
his Bible for a year.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:52.180
The first question that the visiting pastor asked that man is, how have you preached?

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.020
Well, I go online and I find other people's sermons.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.020
It was a sad affair.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:04.180
I mean, just a sad state for this individual.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.220
I'm not seeking to criticize the individual.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.180
I'm simply using it as an illustration of saying, sometimes we know how to give the

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.460
right answers.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:19.180
We can put on the smile, so to speak, and act like everything's okay, but our walk with

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.900
God really is non-existent.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.500
God says to Abram, I am the Almighty God.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.460
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.220
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.460
That complete walk with God.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.080
I am his and he is mine.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.180
What a joy it is.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:47.140
Do you understand the depths of the privilege that is ours to walk with God Almighty?

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.620
Isn't it amazing?

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.360
I am the Almighty God.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.540
Walk before me and be thou perfect.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.620
Hold on a minute.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:46:01.780
I'm just a peon of a human being and you're Almighty God and I get to walk with you.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.780
It's amazing.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:09.140
And unfortunately, there are times in our lives where we get so preoccupied with other

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.260
things that our walk with God suffers.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:19.880
And this evening, I hope that we would take two truths from this passage, that we'd meditate

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:26.280
upon who God is and that we would evaluate our walk with him.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.960
I'm not asking you to tell me what your walk is with God, but you know how your walk is

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.400
with God.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.560
And I'm just asking that you'd be transparent with God tonight, that I'd be transparent

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.720
with God tonight.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.880
How close are we to God?

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:45.000
Brother Tony reminds me often that I made this statement many years ago, that you are

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.240
as close to God as you really want to be.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240
Your walk with God.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.640
You spent as much time reading your Bible today as you really wanted to.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.240
You spent as much time praying today as you really wanted to.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.960
And what a joy to be able to walk with him.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.960
Let's pray.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.080
Father, we love you tonight.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:10.560
Thank you for revealing in your Word who you are.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.640
Indeed, to whom much is given, much is required.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:25.880
I pray that tonight we would stand in awe of you, understanding that you are the Almighty

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:38.840
God, the Lord God Omnipotent, the Creator of all things, the Sustainer of all things,

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:44.360
our Redeemer, our Savior.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:51.240
Thank you for the privilege of being able to draw nigh to God, to walk with you.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:57.200
I pray that as we would meditate upon who you are, you'd help us also to evaluate our

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.760
walk with you.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.280
We understand, and I hope that it's been clearly communicated this evening, that our walk with

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.920
you does not get us saved and it does not keep us saved.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:18.400
It's the result of being saved, understanding that we've been bought with a price, understanding

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:25.240
the great privilege that is ours to commune with you and to walk with you.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.680
I pray, God, that during this time of invitation that you would take and the Holy Spirit would

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.880
minister to each heart as only He can.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:42.320
I don't know the needs of the individuals within this group, but, God, you do.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.840
I pray that you'd work in a distinct way.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.720
Would you help us to respond tonight?

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.600
Would you help us, God, to not quickly leave this place and forget that which we've heard,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:01.280
but, God, that we'd truly be doers of the Word and not hearers only?

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.520
We commit these moments to you, for it's in Christ's name we pray, would you stand

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:04.520
