1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,719
Chapter number six this evening, and we will continue our study here through the life of

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,600
Elisha, and it's been a tremendous blessing.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,880
You'll recall from last Wednesday evening that we looked at the first seven verses of

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,559
2 Kings 6, and I preached a message that I simply entitled, The Iron Did Swim.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,319
What an amazing miracle that was.

6
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:24,920
I could imagine being there and being the guy that's cutting down the tree, and the

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,440
axe head falls in the water.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,680
Everybody cries out for the man of God, and they throw in a stick, and the iron did swim.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
Amen.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
And what a blessing.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,080
As we continue looking and tracing the steps of Elisha, we come to the eighth verse of

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
2 Kings 6.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,919
We'll be looking at verses eight through 23 this evening, and I do trust that it'll be

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:50,159
a blessing to you, and no doubt part of this passage of Scripture, if not the entirety

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,799
of it, but at least part of it would be very familiar to most of you.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,840
And we'll get into that in the midst of our lesson this evening, but we know as we study

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,680
this era of Israel's history over these past several chapters, and even back to the reign

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:17,239
of Ahab and the end of his life, and the life and ministry of Elijah, we've had the opportunity

19
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,779
to really read some of the historical setting with the Syrians going to battle against the

20
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:23,779
children of Israel.

21
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,620
And you see these things taking place.

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,980
You'll recall with me the name Ben-Hadad, he's the king of Syria.

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,620
And as we look at our text of Scripture this evening, we see another one of those times

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,180
in which the Syrians are going to war against the nation of Israel.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,500
And the Bible tells us in verse 8, then the king of Syria warred against Israel and took

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,300
counsel with his servant, saying, And such and such a place shall be my camp.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,059
And we'll get through the entirety of the text down to verse number 23 this evening,

28
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:01,459
but I want to read to you verse number 16.

29
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,459
I'll share with you the title.

30
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,500
We'll get right into the message this evening so that we can get to that video.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,779
And verse number 16 says, And he answered, this is Elisha speaking back to his servant,

32
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,160
and the servant here is not named.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,080
We do not believe that it's Gehazi any longer.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Of course, we trace the steps of Gehazi in chapter number 5 with the miracle with Naaman

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
and what have you.

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
And now we find that there's a servant.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,080
The servant of the man of God is given to us here in this passage of Scripture.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:39,679
And Elisha says to him in verse 16, Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they

39
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,880
that be with them.

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm going to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, More With Us Than

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,160
With Them.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,000
More with us than with them.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,360
As we look at the text of Scripture and we see what's taking place, we find that the

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,860
king of Syria, Ben-Hadad, no doubt he was perplexed as to all that was going on.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:10,520
As a military leader, his strategy was being put on display and he's developing his plan

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,320
of attack and yet it seems as if it just keeps falling apart on him and it's not producing

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,679
the results that he's expecting to produce.

48
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:25,779
In fact, it seems as if those plans are spoiled on more than one occasion and Ben-Hadad comes

49
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:30,279
to the conclusion that there must be a traitor in their midst.

50
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:36,440
Notice with me in verses 8 through 12, as we're taking notes this evening, I want you

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,720
to see that the king is informed.

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,080
When I speak about the king here in this passage of Scripture being informed, I'm speaking

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,160
about the king of Israel and that of course at this time is Jehoram.

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,080
We notice in verse number 8, the Bible says, Then the king of Syria warred against Israel

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:04,039
and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.

56
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,479
He's making his plans.

57
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,919
The Bible says in verse number 9, And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,

58
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,679
Beware that they'll pass not such a place, for thither the Syrians are come down.

59
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:23,799
Now you understand the man of God in verse number 9 that's being referred to as none

60
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:28,760
other than Elisha, the prophet that we have been studying.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,640
I do have a bottle of water somewhere.

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Thank you.

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Jared, leading those songs, you know I need some water.

64
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,760
I remember you the other night, you know.

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,119
And give me just a moment.

66
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:45,160
For those of you that are worried on live stream, I'm not sick, amen.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,880
Got me leading songs and right into the preaching, amen.

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:58,640
But this man of God, this is Elisha, and it tells us in verse number 9 that he sent unto

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,559
the king of Israel.

70
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,679
And this is Jehoram.

71
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,480
He is the king of Israel.

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,440
And notice what here the man of God, Elisha, says to Jehoram.

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:17,399
He says this, Beware that thou pass not such a place, for thither the Syrians are come

74
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
down.

75
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,839
Now in verse number 8, it was Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, that took counsel with his

76
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,040
servants and he said, In such a such a place shall be my camp.

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,920
And now Elisha is informing King Jehoram as to the plans of Ben-Hadad.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,440
These plans have been made known to Elisha by the Lord God Omnipotent, and he is not

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,399
only omnipotent, but he's omniscient, and he knows all things, and he reveals the plans

80
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,399
of Ben-Hadad to Elisha.

81
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,519
And now Elisha informs the king of Israel, and the Bible says in verse number 10, And

82
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,600
the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him, and warned him of,

83
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,399
and saved himself there.

84
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,339
Notice what it says at the end of verse number 10, Not once nor twice.

85
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,679
So this happened several times.

86
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:17,440
Now can you imagine Ben-Hadad, I mean, in his military campaigns, his military career,

87
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,040
and all the strategy that he had developed over the years, and all of the military advancements

88
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,040
that he made, and all of these things that took place, and he's strategizing, he's developing

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,200
his plan of attack, and multiple times it's thwarted.

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,679
The plan seems as if it's spoiled, and he's scratching his head.

91
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,119
I believe that there's a level of perplexity.

92
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:46,440
I believe that he's troubled and frustrated at those things that are taking place.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,160
As we see in verse number 11, it says, Therefore the heart of the king of Syria, notice, was

94
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
sore troubled for this thing.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can you imagine Ben-Hadad?

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,720
I mean, he's wondering, how does he know?

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Who's telling him?

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,040
I mean, what's going on?

99
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,720
And we find that the Bible says that he was sore troubled for this thing, and he calls

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
his servants.

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Now, it's interesting as we find that he calls his servants together, and he says to these

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,980
servants the same ones that are mentioned in verse number 8, that he had taken counsel

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,859
with them and gave them in such and such place shall be my camp, and now he calls these

104
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:30,940
servants and says, will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?

105
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,619
In other words, there's a traitor amongst us.

106
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:40,299
I'm sharing the plan, and somebody's taking it and giving it to the king of Israel.

107
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,299
Who's doing it?

108
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,779
He's troubled.

109
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,540
He's perplexed.

110
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,299
He's frustrated.

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,779
He is absolutely confident.

112
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:49,579
There's a traitor amongst them.

113
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:55,179
I notice that as we come to verse number 12 that one of the servants speaks up, and notice

114
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:59,299
what the servant says, none, my lord, O king.

115
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:06,660
No, there's not a traitor, but notice the next words, but Elisha.

116
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,019
But Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that

117
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,619
thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

118
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,459
Now, that's got to make Ben-Hadad feel very uncomfortable.

119
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:27,420
We find that Ben-Hadad has taken all of the steps necessary to ensure that his plan is

120
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,940
good from a military perspective and the strategy and all of these things, and we find that

121
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,619
Elisha knows the secrets that this one is speaking, even in his bedchamber.

122
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,619
That's got to be unnerving.

123
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:48,619
We find that the king of Israel is informed by Elisha, and here we find that Ben-Hadad,

124
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:55,059
the king of Syria, he finds out about really what's going on and how it's Elisha that is

125
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,380
telling the secrets, how it's Elisha that is informing, giving the information to the

126
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,979
king of Israel, and therefore his plan is being spoiled on multiple occasions.

127
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:09,099
We find that as we move through the text of Scripture, not only do we find that the king

128
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:15,700
is informed by Elisha, but number two, the Syrians invade Dothan.

129
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,340
The Bible tells us in verses 13 through 15 that now the Syrians will invade the city

130
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,580
of Dothan.

131
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,179
You understand why as the Bible tells us in verse number 13, and he, Ben-Hadad, said,

132
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,059
go and spy where he is.

133
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:35,700
He's heard about Elisha and he's heard that Elisha is telling his secrets, he's telling

134
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,179
that he knows the words that he, Ben-Hadad, speaks in his own bedchamber, and he says,

135
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:46,539
go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him.

136
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:51,099
And it was told him, saying, behold, he is in Dothan.

137
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:58,539
And so what does Ben-Hadad do, the king of Syria, after he learns of Elisha's location?

138
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,020
The Bible tells us that he sends a...

139
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,380
great host, and they compassed the city." Notice what it says here in verse

140
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,860
number 14, it says here, "...therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:19,260
host, and they came by night and compassed the city about." It's interesting

142
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,300
that he says that he sent hither, thither, excuse me, horses and chariots, and then

143
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,860
says this, a great host, a great host. It says that they came by night and they

144
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:39,140
compassed the city about. We find that the city is now surrounded. In verse

145
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,940
number 15 it tells us, "...when the servant of the man of God was risen early and

146
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,700
gone forth," notice, "...behold and host compassed the city both with horses and

147
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,060
chariots." Elisha's servant now observes this great host of Syrians that have

148
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,020
compassed the city, and the horses and chariots that are there, and we see that

149
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:10,660
he cries out to Elisha. He says this, "...alas, my master, how shall we do?" Can you

150
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,020
imagine being the servant of Elisha? The Bible says that he rose early in the

151
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,820
morning. We don't know at what time it was, but we know that whenever, as we look

152
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,700
at the text of Scripture, it would seem that when they retired for the evening,

153
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,980
the Syrians were not there. Why? They came by night. When this one rises early, he

154
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,860
goes out and he sees that there's a great host, the horses, the chariots, the

155
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:42,260
Syrians compassed the city, and we find that he cries out to Elisha, and he asks

156
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,860
this question, "...how shall we do?" Why were they there? For Elisha. Because Ben

157
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,260
Hadad said, I want this guy. Remember, he said, find out where he is, go and spy

158
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,140
where he is that I may send and fetch him. He didn't necessarily want to kill

159
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,660
Elisha, according to what we can see here. He desired for Elisha to be returned to

160
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,340
where he was, and we find that now Elisha is called on the scene to his

161
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,860
servant at the end of verse number 15. Early on that morning, when he sees the

162
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,780
host that's there, he cries out, "...alas, my master, how shall we do?" Notice not only

163
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:30,020
that the king is informed by Elisha that the Syrians invade Dothan, but as we

164
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,460
look at verses 16 through 23, we find that Elisha instructs his servant. I'm so

165
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,220
thankful for the instruction that God gives us in His Word. I'm thankful that

166
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,340
God regularly instructs His people. We've been studying the book of Joshua, and

167
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,500
we've mentioned multiple times how God would instruct Joshua, and God was giving

168
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,780
the information. We spoke on Sunday evening, life after the flood. As we look

169
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,540
at those first seven verses of Genesis 9, and we consider life after the flood, and

170
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,660
how there was some instruction that was needed by Noah and his

171
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,020
wife, and his three sons, and their wives. They needed to be instructed. They needed

172
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,420
some direction for life after the flood, for that which they were required and

173
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,580
responsible for doing, and we find that God was faithful to give that

174
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,220
instruction. And oh, even still today, as we mentioned on Sunday evening at the

175
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,740
conclusion of the message, that God has given us instruction. The Word of God is

176
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,380
profitable. The Bible tells us that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

177
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,620
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction

178
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,060
in righteousness. Why? That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto

179
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,980
all good works. And we find that God gives instruction, and here in this text

180
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,060
of Scripture, we find that Elisha is the one instructing the servant. This is his

181
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,020
servant. Again, there's no name that's ascribed to this man, but we find that

182
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:09,340
Elisha is going to instruct him and give him valuable lessons, valuable truth. The

183
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:15,740
truth that Elisha would give to his servant on this day is truth that we

184
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,540
need to be aware of and hold dear to our hearts, even still to this very day. I'm

185
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,180
so thankful that our God is immutable. It's the theological word that we use to

186
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,980
describe the fact that our God never changes, that He is the same yesterday

187
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:38,700
and today and forever. He said there in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not. There

188
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,060
are things changing all around us, but God never changes. He's the same. And what

189
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,900
a joy that is. And when we consider the instruction that Elisha would give to

190
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,900
his servant on this particular day, when the servant sees, he observes the

191
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,940
great host that's compassed the city and he cries out and he says, how shall

192
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,860
we do? And Elisha says, let me give you some instruction. Let me give you some

193
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,660
instruction. Number one, we find in verse number 16 that he tells him, we've used

194
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,900
it for our title this evening, notice he says, fear not, fear not, for they that be

195
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,340
with us are more than they that be with them. Now there are times in our lives

196
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,220
where we struggle with the emotion of fear. We find that here, it would seem

197
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,220
obvious to me that Elisha says fear not, because he understands that the servant

198
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,820
was fearful. The servant, as he observed the great host of people that compassed

199
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,340
the city, he comes and he cries, how shall we do? And Elisha immediately responds

200
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,340
and says, first of all, fear not. I'm so thankful that God has not given us the

201
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,340
spirit of fear. There's a lot of fear going on in our society, in our world

202
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,660
today. God's not giving us the spirit of fear. We know who holds tomorrow. We know

203
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,060
that our God is in control, that He is the Lord God omnipotent, that He reigns

204
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,340
and He rules and He has a purpose and a plan. And the reality this evening is

205
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,740
that it does not mean that we go through life haphazardly. It does not mean that

206
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,260
we tempt the Lord our God, but we do not have to fear. Remember, the Lord is my

207
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,100
helper. He's the one that made heaven and earth. He is the Creator God, and I'm

208
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
mindful of what Hebrews says. In Hebrews chapter 13, and it's interesting,

209
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,860
it's the same, in the same vein of Scripture where we find that the truth

210
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,580
is given of the immutability of God in Hebrews 13 and verse number 8, where it

211
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,580
says, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever. But back in verse

212
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,540
number 5, the Bible says, let your conversation be without covetousness and

213
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,620
be content with such things as you have. For He has said, I will never leave thee

214
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,460
nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper and I will not

215
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:02,620
fear what man shall do unto me. He says, fear not. Fear not. And then He tells them

216
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,220
this, what great instruction. He says, for they that be with us are more than they

217
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,660
that be with them. Hold on, Elisha. It's just two. Did you see all of them? Can you

218
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,060
see? Get yourself in the mind of the servant, right? The servant's the one that

219
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,620
went outside. The servant's the one that saw the Syrians compass the city. He's

220
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,740
seen the great host. He's seen the horses and the chariots, and he runs into

221
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,620
Elisha and says, alas, my master. He says, how shall we do? And Elisha says, fear not.

222
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,660
There's more with us than with them. Elisha, I know it's early. You haven't

223
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,380
had your coffee yet. I don't think they drank coffee. Maybe they did. But the

224
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,820
reality is that Elisha, there's but two. Have you seen them? See, Elisha had vision

225
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,420
that this man did not have. Elisha understood something about God and about

226
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,420
God's plan that this man could not see, and he needed some instruction. He needed

227
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,020
some enlightenment. He needed his eyes to be open, and that's exactly what Elisha

228
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,620
prays in verse number 17, when the Bible says that Elisha prayed and said, Lord, I

229
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:18,420
pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. Open his eyes that he may see, and the

230
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,540
Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And the Bible says this,

231
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:33,460
behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

232
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,100
Now, I'm wondering how this servant must have felt at this particular moment. He

233
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
saw the host of the Syrians. He saw that they compassed the city. He saw the

234
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,700
horses and the chariots, and Elisha prays and says, Lord, open his eyes that he

235
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,860
would see. And the Bible says that God answered that prayer, and he opened the

236
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,020
eyes of this man, and he saw. And what does he see? He sees that the mountain is

237
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,580
full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. That had to be

238
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,100
encouraging. Amen? The perspective of this servant is changed in a hurry. Why?

239
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,780
Because he understands something that Elisha had understood. He has this

240
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,980
spiritual awareness that prior to his eyes being open, he was just not aware of.

241
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,540
He now has this spiritual awareness. Last year, as we taught and preached through

242
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,619
the book of Ephesians during our Sunday morning series, Be Strong in the Lord, I

243
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,460
often dealt with the fact that we are engaged in a spiritual battle, spiritual

244
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,100
warfare. We're not dealing with a cultural war. I understand that people in

245
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,700
the media and people in our society want to speak about culture wars and various

246
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,140
class wars and what have you. We're dealing with a spiritual battle. We're

247
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,940
dealing with spiritual wickedness in high places, and when we understand this

248
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,340
spiritual battle, when we understand that it's a battle between good and evil, the

249
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,100
enemy of God, Satan himself,

250
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,900
is doing all that he can to attack the plan of God

251
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,400
and the purpose of God,

252
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
and he hates the people of God.

253
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
He wants to destroy you.

254
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,200
He wants to destroy us.

255
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
He wants to destroy the church.

256
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
But we know that God says that He is greater.

257
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,400
We know that God has said,

258
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,900
I will build My church,

259
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,700
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

260
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,700
We have great promises from God Almighty,

261
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,700
and here we find that the man's eyes are open,

262
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,900
and he's made aware through the instruction of Elisha

263
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,900
of the protection of God.

264
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
We find that throughout the Word of God,

265
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,400
there's truth given to us

266
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
with regard to the power of God

267
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,900
and the work of God.

268
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
In Psalm 118 v. 6,

269
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,900
I'll read just a few verses for you quickly this evening,

270
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
and I'll give you the reference.

271
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,900
Psalm 118 v. 6, the psalmist says,

272
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
The Lord is on my side.

273
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,400
I will not fear what can man do unto me.

274
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
The Lord is on my side.

275
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I will not fear what can man do unto me.

276
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,400
Consider with me a couple of verses of Scripture

277
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
in the book of Romans in the New Testament.

278
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,900
In Romans 8, we find that the Apostle Paul

279
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,900
is giving great truth here to these believers,

280
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,900
and we find in v. 31 of Romans 8,

281
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
he says, what shall we then say to these things?

282
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,400
If God be for us,

283
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,900
who can be against us?

284
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,400
V. 37, Nay, in all these things

285
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
we are more than conquerors

286
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
through Him that loved us.

287
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,900
In 1 Corinthians 15 and v. 57,

288
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,900
a passage of Scripture that we often go to

289
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,400
and speak about the resurrection of our Savior,

290
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,900
and it is the great chapter

291
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,400
dealing with the resurrection.

292
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,900
It's about Christ's victory

293
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
and the impact of His victory

294
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,400
and the truth that we too will rise.

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,900
And what a blessing that is.

296
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,400
But we notice in v. 57 that he says,

297
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
But thanks be to God,

298
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,400
which giveth us the victory

299
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

300
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,900
Therefore, my beloved brethren,

301
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,400
be you steadfast, unmovable,

302
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
always abounding in the work of the Lord,

303
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,900
for as much as you know

304
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,400
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

305
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,900
We sing victory in Jesus.

306
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
What a great song.

307
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Old Curtis Hudson with the Lord now.

308
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,900
He was with the Lord before I was ever saved.

309
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,400
And I have read some of his things

310
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
and I've understood that often

311
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,900
when he'd preach, he would sing that song.

312
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm on the winning side.

313
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,900
And what a joy to know

314
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
that we are more than conquerors.

315
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
See, this servant is receiving

316
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
some instruction from Elisha.

317
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
He's being informed with regard

318
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,400
to the plan of God and the power of God.

319
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
We notice that here in v. 18

320
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,900
that Elisha prays a bold prayer

321
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,400
and we find that this thing comes to pass.

322
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
And we find that he, the servant,

323
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
would understand the fact that God hears

324
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
and answers prayer.

325
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Notice in v. 18,

326
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,900
And when they came down to him,

327
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said,

328
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Smite this people, I pray thee,

329
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
with blindness.

330
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
And he smote them with blindness

331
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
according to the word of Elisha.

332
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,400
That's good instruction, right?

333
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,900
The servant sees that God hears

334
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
and answers prayer.

335
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
What a joy to know that we have a God

336
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
that hears and answers prayer.

337
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
To understand that the effectual,

338
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
fervent prayer of a righteous man

339
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
availeth much, the Bible tells us in James 5.

340
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
We find that there are prayer promises

341
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,900
throughout the Word of God,

342
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
many of which we've quoted,

343
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,900
we've committed to memory.

344
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,400
Jeremiah 33 v. 3,

345
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Call unto Me and I will answer thee

346
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
and show thee great and mighty things

347
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,900
which thou knowest not.

348
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
We find in the book of Ephesians

349
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,400
in v. 20 of chapter 3,

350
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,900
unto Him which is able to do exceeding

351
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,400
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

352
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
We have this confidence

353
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
that if we pray according to His will,

354
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,900
He heareth us.

355
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,400
We find that in 1 John 5.

356
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,900
What a joy.

357
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,400
What great instruction

358
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
that this servant receives

359
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
with regard to the power of prayer.

360
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,900
Elisha prays and it's done.

361
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
It says in v. 19,

362
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,400
And Elisha said unto them,

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Notice, it's interesting what happens.

364
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,900
Elisha prays that this great host that comes,

365
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,900
he says, Lord, smite him with blindness.

366
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
God smites him with blindness.

367
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,400
And then Elisha says to them in v. 19,

368
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
This is not the way,

369
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
neither is this the city.

370
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
Follow me and I will bring you

371
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
to the man whom you seek.

372
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,400
This is comical.

373
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
This is hilarious.

374
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Elisha says you're in the wrong place.

375
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Let me lead you to where you need to go.

376
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,900
After God had smitten them with blindness,

377
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,400
and answering the prayer of Elisha,

378
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
and Elisha leads them to Samaria,

379
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
the Bible says that they came to Samaria

380
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
in v. 20, when they were coming to Samaria,

381
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
that Elisha said,

382
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Lord, open the eyes of these men

383
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
that they may see.

384
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,900
And the Lord opened their eyes.

385
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,400
Again, answered prayer.

386
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,900
And they saw.

387
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,400
And behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

388
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,900
Notice in v. 21, the Bible says,

389
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
The king of Israel said unto Elisha,

390
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
when he saw them,

391
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
My father, shall I smite them?

392
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,900
Shall I smite them?

393
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Elisha says, thou shalt not smite them.

394
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,400
What dost thou smite those

395
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,900
whom thou hast taken captive

396
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
with thy sword and with thy bow?

397
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,400
Set bread and water before them,

398
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,900
that they may eat and drink

399
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
and go to their master.

400
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,400
And he prepared great provision for them.

401
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
When they had eaten and drunk,

402
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
he sent them away.

403
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,400
And they went to their master.

404
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,900
The Bible doesn't tell us

405
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,900
what happens when they get back to their master.

406
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,400
But I'd love to have been there.

407
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,900
Right? Wouldn't you?

408
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,900
They come back and Elisha's not with them.

409
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Why is the whole purpose

410
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
that Ben-Hadad sent them?

411
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,400
He knew where Elisha was.

412
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
He's in Dothan.

413
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
The spies told him they were aware of his location.

414
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Go and fetch him. Bring him to me.

415
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
They come back.

416
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
What's he expecting?

417
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
Where's Elisha?

418
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,400
He's not here.

419
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
What happened?

420
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Well, let me tell you what happened.

421
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,900
Can you imagine these servants

422
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,400
telling the story of what happened?

423
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,900
I mean, they were smitten with blindness.

424
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,400
They were led to Samaria.

425
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,900
Their eyes were opened.

426
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,400
They now could see.

427
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,900
They were fed by the King of Israel.

428
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Then they go back to their master

429
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,400
empty-handed.

430
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
The Bible says at the end of v. 23,

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,900
so the bands of Syria

432
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
came no more into the land of Israel.

433
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,400
This obviously didn't last

434
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,900
a lengthy period of time

435
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
with the conflict ended

436
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
between the Syrians and the Israelites,

437
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,900
for we see that as we continue

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,400
moving through the passage of Scripture,

439
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
there's a period of time between v. 23 and 24.

440
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
We don't know how long.

441
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
But then we find that there's another event

442
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
that is given to us

443
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,400
with regard to the Syrians

444
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,900
besieging the city of Samaria.

445
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,400
But we find that these Syrians

446
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
are led to Samaria.

447
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,900
Their blindness is miraculously healed.

448
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
And then they are fed and returned

449
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,400
to Ben-Hadad empty-handed,

450
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
all the while Elisha's protected.

451
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,900
He's protected miraculously.

452
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,400
This is wonderful instruction

453
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
for this servant.

454
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,900
See, Elisha understood many of these things

455
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,400
obviously in his life.

456
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
He'd experienced the mighty power

457
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
of God in his life.

458
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,900
He'd experienced the miracles

459
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,400
and the answered prayer.

460
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
But now this servant,

461
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,400
when he first goes out on that early morning,

462
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
and he sees the great hosts,

463
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,900
the horses and the chariots,

464
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
and he says,

465
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,400
the city is compassed about

466
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
with these Syrians.

467
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
There's a great host.

468
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Alas, my master, how shall we do?

469
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,900
Fear not.

470
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,400
There are more with us than with them.

471
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
All he needed to do

472
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,900
was be able to see properly.

473
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,400
To be enlightened.

474
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Elisha was aware of the presence of God

475
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,900
and of the power of God.

476
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,400
And this servant that is given to us

477
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
here in 2 Kings 6,

478
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
he was instructed,

479
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,400
and the instruction that he received

480
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
is the instruction that we still need today.

481
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,900
Our God is in control.

482
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Our God is able to protect us.

483
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
He is able to do exceeding abundantly

484
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,400
above all that we ask or think.

485
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
He has a plan and His plan is perfect.

486
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
He makes no mistakes whatsoever.

487
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
And we can rejoice in understanding

488
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,900
that He hears and answers prayer.

489
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
He extends to us that invitation

490
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
to call unto Him.

491
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,400
And this evening,

492
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,900
we find that Elisha says to this servant,

493
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,900
there are more with us than with them.

494
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
If God be for us,

495
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
who can be against us?

496
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,400
We are more than conquerors.

497
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,900
More than conquerors.

498
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
I'm so thankful for victory

499
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

500
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,900
And that we can sing with Curtis Hudson,

501
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
I am on the winning side.

502
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Don't leave us.

503
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
We're going to pray

504
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
and then we're going to watch the update video.

505
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
And let's pray.

506
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,400
Father, we love You.

507
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Thank You for loving us.

508
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Thank You for this account

509
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,400
that You gave us in Your Word.

510
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,900
We thank You for the historical truth

511
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,400
of the record.

512
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,900
Just the miraculous events that transpire

513
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,400
and how through these circumstances,

514
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
You were allowing this servant

515
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,900
to be instructed.

516
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,400
You were allowing this servant

517
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,900
to learn truth about Your plan

518
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,400
and Your power and Your protection.

519
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,400
About the privilege and answer to prayer.

520
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,900
What a joy.

521
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,400
God, I pray this evening

522
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
that as we've observed some of the instruction

523
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,900
that this servant has received,

524
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,400
that we too would be instructed

525
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,900
and that we would be encouraged

526
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
and strengthened in our walk with Thee.

527
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
We thank You for the missionaries

528
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
that You've given us the opportunity to support.

529
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I pray that as we watch this update video

530
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,900
that You'd help us to be encouraged and strengthened.

531
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,400
I pray that You would just continue to use us

532
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
to be a blessing to these missionaries

533
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
around the world.

534
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
And we'll thank You for it.

535
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
In Christ's name we pray.

536
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Amen.
