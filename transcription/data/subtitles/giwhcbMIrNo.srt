1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
2 Corinthians 2, we'll be looking at verses 12 down through verse 17 this morning and

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,460
finishing up this second chapter as we're studying through the book of 2 Corinthians.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,479
And last week we looked at the preceding text of Scripture in verses 5-11 and in that passage

4
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:23,399
we dealt with the subject matter that Paul was giving this counsel to the believers in

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,079
Corinth and we titled the message forgiveness and the importance of understanding that this

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:35,599
one that had offended had responded to the church discipline.

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:42,000
They had, as we could look through the Scriptures and as best we can tell, they had repented

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,159
and God gave through the Apostle Paul instruction to this church with dealing with this individual

9
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:55,400
and to comfort him and to, well to forgive him and to comfort him and then to confirm

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,479
your love toward him.

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,880
It was the threefold process that God gave and Paul then said this at the end of verse

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,400
9 that he wanted to know whether they'd be obedient in all things.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,000
See the matter was serious and Paul was concerned about the unity of the church in Corinth and

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,319
Paul understood that the church was a church, if you read the first letter, that was known

15
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,480
for its divisions and contentions and all that was going on.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,519
It was a carnal church that the enemy was having his way and we find that the Apostle

17
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,519
Paul desired for these believers to be strong in the faith, that he desired that they would

18
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,839
grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and they would not make

19
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:46,599
decisions that would make them vulnerable to the attack of the enemy.

20
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,319
As he ends in verse number 11, lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we're not

21
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:58,120
ignorant of his devices and Paul provided that counsel to the church and what good

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,040
counsel it is and as we continue through the text of Scripture we find in verse 12 he says,

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,800
furthermore, and so Paul is actually going to pick up a thought that he had kind of left

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,639
off for a period of time and begin to address again the situation with him not being in

25
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:21,520
Corinth as he had given them with regard to his travel plans and he says, furthermore,

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:30,080
when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the Lord.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,600
And what a blessing to just think about the truth of verse number 12 where Paul was traveling,

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,880
he had this purpose in his travel to what?

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,039
To preach the gospel because he understood that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

30
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,839
There's a man delivering Amazon packages on the same road that we were distributing literature

31
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:52,720
yesterday and I said, hey, you're delivering packages and I'm delivering the gospel here,

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,520
this is for you and he said, man, I love the gospel.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,320
And we got to chat just for a moment and praise the Lord for that opportunity but we are the

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,720
bearers of the truth of the gospel and Paul said there was a door that was opened but

35
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,800
I want you to see that Paul dealt with situations and struggles just as we do and he said in

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,000
verse 13, I had no rest in my spirit.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,240
There was something that was troubling the Apostle Paul, there was something that was

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,000
of concern to the Apostle Paul and I believe this morning that as we study the Bible that

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,320
God records certain things for us like this verse of scripture to help us understand that

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Paul was a man like we are and he had the same struggles that we deal with and he said,

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,279
I had no rest in my spirit, why?

42
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:47,679
Because I found not Titus my brother and he had been looking for Titus and of course with

43
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,919
regard to the letter that had been sent to the church in Corinth and understanding how

44
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,839
would they receive and how would they respond and Paul was concerned about that.

45
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:02,279
That was a heavy thing on the heart of Paul and he could not find Titus and therefore

46
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,639
because of the inability on Paul's part to find Titus, notice what it says he did, but

47
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,360
taking my leave of them I went from Fence into Macedonia.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,160
He went looking for Titus, now it's kind of interesting because then Paul's going to give

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,720
us some truth in the next several verses that will be the text in which we'll be studying

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,480
this morning but what Paul says in verse 12 and 13 triggers a thought in his mind about

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,320
the leadership of God and about the ministry that God had called him to that's literally

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,839
going to take the next several chapters of space in our Bibles before he gets back to

53
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,480
the meeting with Titus.

54
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,559
He doesn't actually reference him finding Titus until 2 Corinthians 7 verses 5 and 6

55
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:53,440
and so if you want to call it a parenthetical, it is a big parenthetical that Paul is about

56
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,320
to elaborate on the ministry and I'm so thankful that God called the Apostle Paul and that

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,480
God used the Apostle Paul and that we have the opportunity to be able to look at the

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,399
perspective and philosophy that God gives to us through these pages of scripture with

59
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,920
regard to the ministry.

60
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Notice that Paul says this in verse 14, now, now thanks be unto God which always causeth

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:33,519
us to triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every

62
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,839
place.

63
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,320
As we look at this portion of scripture this morning, I want to preach a message that I've

64
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,079
simply titled Victory in Jesus and we're all familiar with that song, that song that we

65
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:52,040
sing, a familiar hymn, Victory in Jesus and I'm so thankful this morning that Paul experienced

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:06:00,559
victory and that we understand that we too are victors, we have victory because our Savior

67
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:06,839
is victorious, because he conquered sin, death and the grave, because he's alive forevermore,

68
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,600
because he rules and reigns and because he is victorious, then we as his people, as his

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,119
children, we too are victorious.

70
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,920
You know what I find in life?

71
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Not every Christian lives victorious.

72
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,600
There's some Christians that are living defeated lives.

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:36,320
There's some Christians that are living like they're not victors, like they've lost.

74
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,799
There's some Christians that are not experiencing victory regularly in their lives.

75
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh, they're experiencing defeat after defeat.

76
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
Can I remind you?

77
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,640
The Bible tells us that we're more than conquerors.

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,399
We're going to look at the verse in just a moment.

79
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,359
Can I remind you that the Bible tells us, as John is writing in 1 John, yes, we have

80
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:03,899
many things that we face, but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

81
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,160
We are overcomers.

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
We are victors.

83
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,739
We're on the victory side.

84
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:16,019
We find here this morning that Paul is rejoicing because of this victory.

85
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,100
Notice he says, now thanks be unto God.

86
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,260
I mean, he's rejoicing.

87
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,019
And by the way, we ought to rejoice in the victory that is ours.

88
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:29,980
We ought to rejoice in the fact that we serve a God who is victorious, who always wins,

89
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:37,619
who is the victor, and he's our Savior.

90
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,940
I'm on the winning side.

91
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
How many of you know that song?

92
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
I don't know if you've heard that song before.

93
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,459
I never got to see or hear Curtis Hudson preach in person, and I didn't get saved until after

94
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,940
he went home to be with the Lord, but I've heard and read a lot of things about Curtis

95
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Hudson.

96
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,299
And God used Curtis Hudson in a great way.

97
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:55,700
He was a pastor for a number of years, and then he was the editor of the Sword of the

98
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,859
Lord, and he traveled all around this country and abroad as well, and he would preach and

99
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,820
preach and preach, and God used him in a great way.

100
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,339
And I'm told, and I've heard audio, where he would start singing, I'm on the winning

101
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,339
side.

102
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,540
It is a great thing to know victory in Jesus.

103
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,779
As we look at the text of Scripture this morning and think about this thought for just a few

104
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,380
moments, consider with me, number one, the source of victory.

105
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,980
The source of victory.

106
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,619
It is imperative that we as the people of God acknowledge and always remember the source

107
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,059
of victory.

108
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:41,179
It says in verse number 14 very plainly, now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us

109
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,460
to triumph in Christ.

110
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,580
You don't have victory because of you.

111
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,979
You have victory because of Jesus.

112
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:55,820
And it's important that we understand the source of victory.

113
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,979
It's important that we acknowledge, see, when we acknowledge that He is the source of our

114
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:08,900
victory, that I can have victory in Jesus because of what He's done, then it helps me

115
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,979
to keep a humble perspective in life.

116
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:16,619
It helps me to stay reliant upon Him, and we find that throughout the Scriptures that

117
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:22,179
we're encouraged and we're reminded that He is the source of victory.

118
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,659
And we find that the Apostle Paul, notice how he says it, and I've read it already,

119
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,900
but it's so important to reiterate, now thanks be unto God.

120
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:39,380
Notice this, which always causeth us to triumph, literally to have victory in Christ.

121
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,739
Did you catch that little phrase, which always?

122
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:50,419
Listen, we ought to always be experiencing victory.

123
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:55,619
We talk about, we use the pass of the Old Testament from the book of Joshua to talk

124
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:59,979
about the picture, if you will, of the victorious Christian life.

125
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,739
and the desire that we have as the people of God

126
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:08,479
to have that victorious Christian life.

127
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,679
We don't want to live in defeat.

128
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,559
We don't want to live in discouragement.

129
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,019
We want to live in victory.

130
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,999
And we find that the source is Jesus.

131
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,759
Notice in Romans chapter eight,

132
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,159
and we'll look at a couple of verses of scripture here

133
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,959
that just no doubt you're familiar with them,

134
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,999
but it's important for us to see them

135
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:29,099
and understand that Paul, as he was a man

136
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,239
that experienced victory in his life.

137
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,639
In fact, I would say that Paul's life

138
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,039
was marked by victory.

139
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,279
Paul understood what it was to serve the conquering Christ

140
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,999
and understood that Christ was the source

141
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,279
of victory in his life.

142
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,879
In verse 31 of Romans eight, the Bible says this,

143
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,439
what shall we then say to these things?

144
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,439
If God be for us, who can be against us?

145
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,239
He that spared not his own son,

146
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,099
but delivered him up for us all,

147
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:04,099
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

148
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,899
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?

149
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,219
It is God that justifieth.

150
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,259
Who is he that condemneth?

151
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,379
It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again,

152
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,419
who is even at the right hand of God,

153
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,279
who always maketh intercession for us.

154
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,139
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

155
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,899
Shall tribulation or distress or persecution

156
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,359
or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,

157
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,239
as it is written, for thy sake,

158
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,919
we are killed all the day long.

159
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,519
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

160
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,519
Nay, in all these things we are more

161
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,239
than conquerors noticed through him that loved us.

162
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,079
Who is that?

163
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,759
Well, that's Jesus.

164
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,959
Through him that loved us, for I am persuaded

165
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,119
that neither death nor life nor angels

166
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,859
nor principalities nor powers nor things present

167
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,019
nor things to come nor height nor depth

168
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,899
nor any other creature shall be able to separate us

169
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,899
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

170
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,419
Paul understood what it was to face opposition.

171
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,559
Paul understood what it was to be ridiculed,

172
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,179
to be misunderstood, but Paul understood

173
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,819
he was on the winning side.

174
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,139
Paul understood that he had victory in Jesus.

175
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,099
He understood that though there would be circumstances

176
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,759
and situations that he would face,

177
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,599
he said, who, God is for us and so who can be against us?

178
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:35,039
He said, in all these things we are more than conquerors

179
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,719
through him that loved us.

180
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,079
He says this in 1 Corinthians chapter 15

181
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,579
as we consider that great passage of scripture

182
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,159
dealing with the resurrection

183
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,319
and oh, what a wonderful glorious truth it is

184
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,479
that Jesus is the first fruits,

185
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,599
that he conquered sin, death and the grave,

186
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:55,419
that he rose from that buried or that borrowed tomb

187
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:58,819
and he lives forevermore and what a blessing

188
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,219
to know the truth of the resurrection.

189
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:04,219
Remember that Paul in this passage of scripture,

190
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:06,539
there were some that were denying the resurrection

191
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,539
and they were uncertain of the resurrection.

192
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,059
He said, if Christ be not risen,

193
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,879
then our faith is in vain, our preaching is in vain,

194
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,219
but now is Christ risen from the dead.

195
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:19,139
I mean, it's an awesome passage of scripture

196
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,159
that proves the truth of the resurrection,

197
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,479
but we understand that with the truth of the resurrection

198
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:30,279
brings hope to God's people, for he's the first fruits

199
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,939
and I will rise and you will rise and what a blessing.

200
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,599
And he says at the end of all of this dealing

201
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,719
with this truth of the resurrection in verse 51

202
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,479
of 1 Corinthians 15, behold, I show you a mystery.

203
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:47,239
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

204
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,179
See, here's the truth, we're not all going to die, why?

205
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,659
There's gonna be a generation that's going to be,

206
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,979
that's gonna be raptured out of here.

207
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:58,059
I hope it's my generation, amen, hallelujah.

208
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:01,779
It'd be wonderful, but we all shall be changed.

209
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,539
Notice, in a moment, the twinkling of an eye,

210
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:08,579
the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound

211
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,619
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible

212
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:13,299
and we shall be changed.

213
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,259
For this corruptible must put on incorruption

214
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,839
and this mortal must put on immortality.

215
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,199
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption

216
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,599
and this mortal shall have put on immortality,

217
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,599
then shall be brought to pass the saying

218
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,959
that is written, death is swallowed up,

219
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,439
what does it say?

220
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,739
In victory, hallelujah.

221
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,959
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

222
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,079
Oh, grave, where is thy victory?

223
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,219
The sting of death is sin,

224
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,219
the strength of sin is the law,

225
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,579
but thanks be to God,

226
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,579
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

227
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:59,019
He giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

228
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,699
He is the source.

229
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,379
It's not that I got the victory on my own,

230
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,019
it's not that you get, in fact, we can't.

231
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,099
We can't.

232
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,399
Your flesh will fail you.

233
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,399
The Bible says walk in the spirit

234
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,799
and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

235
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,159
You know why we're fulfilling the lust of the flesh?

236
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,159
Because we're not walking in the spirit.

237
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:26,279
The Bible truth in Galatians chapter five.

238
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,959
But he says, but thanks be to God,

239
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,359
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

240
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,559
Notice in 1 John, I referenced already

241
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,879
the fourth chapter of 1 John,

242
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,699
but I want you to look at a couple of verses

243
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,219
there in the fifth chapter.

244
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,259
The Bible says, and as you're turning to 1 John five,

245
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,499
in 1 John four and verse four,

246
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,379
you're of God, little children,

247
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,419
and overcome them because greater is he that is in you

248
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,559
than he that is in the world.

249
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,359
I'm thankful that I am a child of God.

250
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,259
In fact, the third chapter begins

251
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,979
by talking about what manner of love

252
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,539
the Father hath bestowed upon us

253
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:02,459
that we should be called the sons of God.

254
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,179
What a blessing.

255
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,479
In chapter five of 1 John,

256
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,639
the Bible says this in verse number four,

257
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,119
for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.

258
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,759
And this is the victory that overcometh the world,

259
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,499
even our faith.

260
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:21,179
Who is he that overcometh the world,

261
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,919
but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God.

262
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,939
We sing the song, faith is the victory.

263
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:29,679
Faith is the victory.

264
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,919
It's a familiar song that we sing.

265
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,299
It's found in this verse of scripture,

266
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,779
the truth, the biblical truth

267
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,699
that led the songwriter to write the song.

268
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:44,059
And we find that it says that we are overcomers,

269
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:47,579
that we are victorious, that we are conquerors.

270
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,919
The apostle Paul, as he begins writing,

271
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,659
and he mentions about this situation

272
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,199
where he was traveling and this opportunity came

273
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,259
as he went to Troas to preach the gospel,

274
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,239
the door was open, but he had no rest in his spirit.

275
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,319
And he was looking for Titus.

276
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,699
And then as he remembers how God brought all that together,

277
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,379
and even before he pens it in the seventh chapter,

278
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:16,239
he starts rejoicing in the fact

279
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:19,319
that God causeth us to victory.

280
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,319
He always causeth us to triumph in Christ.

281
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,559
We see the source of victory to begin verse number 14.

282
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,759
But then as we continue through the text

283
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,819
in 2 Corinthians chapter number two,

284
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,399
we find the scene of victory.

285
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:36,499
It's actually pretty awesome what the apostle Paul

286
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,499
begins to illustrate for us here.

287
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,299
Notice in the end of verse number 14,

288
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,299
and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge

289
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,819
by us in every place.

290
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,819
For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ

291
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,739
in them that are saved.

292
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,919
And in them that perish.

293
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,999
To the one we are the savor of death unto death

294
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,999
and to the other, the savor of life unto life.

295
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,239
He ends verse 16 in who is sufficient for these things.

296
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,299
I'll deal with that in just a moment.

297
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,279
But I believe in this passage of scripture

298
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,159
that the apostle Paul begins to reference something

299
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,599
that the people in Corinth would have been

300
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,319
very familiar with.

301
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,659
What is it that Paul references is the Roman triumph.

302
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,879
And in there, I believe that he references

303
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,599
this Roman triumph in order to assist the believers

304
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,599
in Corinth to understand the victory that we have in Jesus.

305
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,559
The Romans had this Roman triumph that would be given

306
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,339
really like a parade that would be given

307
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,000
to successful generals as they returned from their conquest.

308
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,119
And it was a big deal.

309
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,679
I mean, there was a lot of fanfare,

310
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,559
all sorts of things that were going on.

311
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,459
And when they would do this, they would bring with them,

312
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,179
of course, the soldiers that were fighting

313
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,260
with that Roman general, along with the captives

314
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,579
that they had taken, along with the loot

315
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,779
that they had brought back with them, the bounty,

316
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,479
along with, it is recorded, it is understood,

317
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:20,019
that the sons of the general, the one that had

318
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:24,899
that Roman triumph on his behalf because of his conquering,

319
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,239
that his sons would be there with him.

320
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,799
It's kind of an interesting picture.

321
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,799
Now, of course, we are so far removed

322
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,919
that we have to simply look at history

323
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,279
and begin reading and trying to understand.

324
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,159
But these people, these original recipients in Corinth,

325
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,760
they would have been very familiar.

326
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,199
Some of the things that they would do

327
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:47,199
is they would parade through the town.

328
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:50,839
They would have this incense that would be burned.

329
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,079
And it's interesting that he makes reference to that

330
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,820
with regard to the savor that is mentioned

331
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,859
in verse 14 and again in verse 16.

332
00:19:58,859 --> 00:19:59,699
And he begins to.

333
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,499
to help the people of God understand the victory

334
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,499
that we have through Christ.

335
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,219
The scene of victory.

336
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:11,539
Christ is the victor.

337
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,459
And we as His people are walking along with Him.

338
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:15,859
But as many as received Him,

339
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,419
then gave He power to become the sons of God.

340
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,539
If you're saved this morning, you're a child of God.

341
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,419
And you're on the winning side.

342
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:28,779
We find that the Apostle Paul is making known here

343
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,819
this truth and helping us understand the scene.

344
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,539
Notice at the end of verse 14,

345
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,739
and maketh manifest the savor of His knowledge

346
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,499
by us in every place.

347
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,019
I'm thankful that God uses us

348
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,979
to make Him known in every place.

349
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,379
You know, we're to make Christ known.

350
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:51,039
That's what our job is.

351
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,899
That's what our duty is.

352
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,519
And we find that as we understand

353
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,039
that He always causeth us to triumph in Christ,

354
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,399
that He's making manifest,

355
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:04,039
making known Himself,

356
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,679
the savor of His knowledge,

357
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,559
notice, by us in every place.

358
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,919
Isn't it amazing that God would use us?

359
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,319
It's amazing that God would use us

360
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,279
to make Him known.

361
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,999
Those that know Christ are the ones

362
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:21,999
that can make Him known.

363
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,439
So that's kind of a simple statement.

364
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,919
It is, but you know how many know Him

365
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,039
that don't take any time to ever try to make Him known.

366
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,239
We can't expect a lost person to make Christ known.

367
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,559
He doesn't know Christ.

368
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,419
It's saved people.

369
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:39,919
I sent a text to somebody this week.

370
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,259
I don't know if they're saved or not,

371
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,839
but I had some interaction with them,

372
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,839
and I sent them a text,

373
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,999
and I said to them, I said,

374
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,719
I'd love to connect with you,

375
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,879
and I went through a number of things,

376
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:48,959
and then I said this.

377
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,599
I'd love to be able to sit down and talk to you

378
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,279
and let you know how Christ changed my life.

379
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:55,959
Why?

380
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,239
Because I can talk to that person personally

381
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,799
about what Christ did for me

382
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,239
and what He could do for them.

383
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,599
See, Paul says we're understanding this truth of victory.

384
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,439
We are more than conquerors through Christ,

385
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:15,639
and He's using us to make Himself known in every place.

386
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,519
Notice this in verse 15.

387
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,079
He says, for we are unto God a sweet saver of Christ,

388
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,079
and them that are saved and them that perish

389
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:26,319
unto the one, we're the saver of death unto death,

390
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,879
and to the other, the saver of life unto life.

391
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,479
Interesting verses of Scripture,

392
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,679
but the reality in verses 15 and 16

393
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,999
is we understand that the gospel is the power of God

394
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,919
unto salvation to every one that believeth,

395
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,399
but we understand that not everyone will believe.

396
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,479
Not everyone will believe.

397
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,519
John chapter one says He came to His own,

398
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,839
and His own received Him not,

399
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,279
but as many as received Him.

400
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,319
To them gave He power to become the sons of God,

401
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,079
even them that believe on His name.

402
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,919
Not everyone that hears the name of Jesus

403
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,519
is going to be saved.

404
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,599
You can read through the Old Testament.

405
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,199
You can think about New Testament truth.

406
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:15,999
You can look at lives throughout the pages of history.

407
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:20,399
You can look at even modern, our contemporaries,

408
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,119
and we can understand that not everyone

409
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,959
is going to accept the truth of the gospel.

410
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,439
We can understand that you can have children

411
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,759
that are raised in the same home,

412
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,479
with the same parents, with the same teaching.

413
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,519
You can have people that can sit in a church

414
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,639
with the same pastor, with the same preaching,

415
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,319
and you can take one that is going to accept it

416
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,799
and believe it and live it,

417
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,699
and you can take another one that says not for me, sorry,

418
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,759
but I want you to understand

419
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,079
that's because God gave man a free will.

420
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,679
God gave man a free will.

421
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,399
It is not God's will that any man should perish,

422
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:56,999
but that all should come to repentance.

423
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,439
We see that clearly throughout the scriptures,

424
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,439
and we find that God makes that known to us,

425
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,399
and we understand that,

426
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,159
and therefore, His sacrifice is sufficient

427
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,119
for all of humanity.

428
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,559
We can be absolutely confident

429
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,279
that when we share the gospel with an individual

430
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,839
and say to them that Jesus is the only Savior

431
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,159
and that He can save you,

432
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,439
we can understand that His atonement

433
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,999
and His sacrifice is still sufficient

434
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,399
to save sinners today.

435
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,159
I said to that young man yesterday,

436
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:32,639
right in the driveway as I talked to him,

437
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,199
I said, listen, for whosoever shall call upon

438
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:38,799
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

439
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,679
We believe it,

440
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,879
but I was confronted yesterday with the truth

441
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:50,079
that though that young man understood he was lost,

442
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,119
he understood that what he had believed for years

443
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,919
about his works getting him to heaven

444
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,319
was not true biblically,

445
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,479
and yet he was still not ready to accept Christ

446
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,199
as his Savior.

447
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,599
I can't make Him, and you can't make Him.

448
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,759
In fact, if we force them,

449
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,839
it's probably not really genuine,

450
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,559
and they're probably gonna die and go to hell

451
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,859
having a false hope until they die.

452
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:19,859
The reality this morning is that our God is victorious,

453
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,379
and we see this scene,

454
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:25,779
and we see the work that God is doing in every place.

455
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,419
I love the way verse number 14 ends,

456
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,379
in every place.

457
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:34,619
See, Paul had this passion to go to the regions beyond.

458
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,579
Paul had this passion to go into all the world

459
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,059
to be able to preach the gospel.

460
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:39,899
Why?

461
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:44,059
Because he understood that souls needed to hear the truth.

462
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,699
I said this back in December

463
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,979
as I considered some of the truth

464
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,579
from John 1, verses 11 and 12

465
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,259
about those that received Him not

466
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,859
and those that did receive Him,

467
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,799
that the reality is that there are far too many people

468
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,679
in our community today that do not even know

469
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,299
that they have a choice to receive Him or not.

470
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,419
They're not even aware of the very truth

471
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,979
that Jesus died for them and He loves them,

472
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:11,939
and we have an opportunity in every place

473
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:13,339
to make Christ known.

474
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,579
And as Paul would paint this scene for us,

475
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,339
reminded this morning of this truth,

476
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,819
look at Colossians 2.

477
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,739
I love this portion of scripture in Colossians 2,

478
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:28,779
dealing with the resurrection and all that Christ did,

479
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:33,779
and we find that His sacrifice was sufficient.

480
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:36,859
It says in Colossians 2, in verse 14,

481
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,499
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances

482
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:42,979
that was against us, which was contrary to us,

483
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:47,979
and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross.

484
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,659
Man, hallelujah.

485
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,899
But then notice verse 15.

486
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:57,739
And having spoiled principalities and powers,

487
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:00,779
He made a show of them openly,

488
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:05,179
triumphing over them in it.

489
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,699
The devil was defeated at Calvary.

490
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,459
I believe that the devil thought

491
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,299
he was victorious at Calvary.

492
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:16,419
He did everything he could.

493
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,139
I mean, for centuries, he did everything he could

494
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,459
to destroy the line, the Messianic line.

495
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,219
He did everything that he could to corrupt the line.

496
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:30,219
You look at all the various aspects of the Old Testament,

497
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:32,339
you look at all these things that are going on,

498
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:35,579
and you find that Satan is trying to infiltrate

499
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,259
and to annihilate and to cause the fact

500
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,259
that Messiah would not be able to come.

501
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,019
But all of those plans were, they were just fruitless.

502
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,419
I mean, they could not.

503
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:55,499
I think about the events of Christ's life

504
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,819
and many times in which the religious leaders

505
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,179
sought to stone Jesus and kill Jesus

506
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,099
in a storm that was so violent

507
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,979
that the men who had been fishermen all their lives

508
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:10,539
said, Master, carest thou not that we perish?

509
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:15,339
But through all of that, Jesus was gonna go to that cross.

510
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:16,859
And in the Garden of Gethsemane,

511
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,339
as He's in great affliction

512
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,419
and dealing with all of that pressure,

513
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,979
I believe that when He prays,

514
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,299
to let that cup pass,

515
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,259
and when He says, let thy will be done,

516
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,179
I don't believe that Jesus was praying

517
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,579
for one moment to not go to the cross.

518
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:47,459
Because Jesus knew that He came to go to the cross.

519
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:50,459
He talked about it openly.

520
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:55,619
He knew that was necessary.

521
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:00,739
In fact, as you read Hebrews chapter number 12,

522
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:04,459
He went to that cross willingly,

523
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,419
understanding what would be accomplished

524
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:09,859
through that substitutionary atonement.

525
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,419
In verse number two, it says this,

526
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,179
excuse me, verse number, yeah, I'll use verse number two,

527
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,739
who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross.

528
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,579
The joy that was set before Him.

529
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,659
He wasn't praying to get out of going to the cross.

530
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,579
I believe Satan was trying to kill Him in the garden

531
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,499
before He could ever get to the cross.

532
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:31,219
But He went to that cross,

533
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,899
and He was buried in that borrowed tomb,

534
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,819
and He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave,

535
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:45,819
and our enemy was defeated once for all.

536
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,019
And according to Colossians chapter two,

537
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,739
God, the Lord Jesus Christ,

538
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:55,699
spoiled principalities and powers,

539
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:59,059
and He made a show of them openly.

540
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:03,559
triumphing over them in it.

541
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,559
I think Paul had the same thought in mind here

542
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,039
as he did in 2 Corinthians 2.

543
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,599
I'm reminded of 1 John 3 in verse number eight.

544
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,679
I'll read the verse for you

545
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,799
and we'll get back to our passage in 2 Corinthians.

546
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,799
But the Bible says this

547
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,839
in 1 John 3 in verse number eight.

548
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,359
He that committed the sins of the devil

549
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,959
for the devil sinneth from the beginning.

550
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,959
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested

551
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:30,479
that he might destroy the works of the devil.

552
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,739
We see the source of victory.

553
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:35,919
We see the scene of victory.

554
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,939
But as we go back to 2 Corinthians chapter number two,

555
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,059
I believe that we see the strategy for victory.

556
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,419
The strategy for victory.

557
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,459
Now, before you get too ahead of yourself,

558
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:46,679
I'm not being contradictory.

559
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,819
The source is Jesus.

560
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,399
But understand that if we want to experience the victory,

561
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,299
we must do it his way.

562
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,419
God's work must be done God's way.

563
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,819
It's a truth throughout the scriptures.

564
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,379
So vitally important.

565
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:04,779
We come to this passage and we find that in verse 16,

566
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,739
as we consider the strategy for victory,

567
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,459
that Paul ends the verse of scripture by saying this,

568
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:14,119
who is sufficient for these things?

569
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,699
Apart from Christ, none of us are sufficient.

570
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:20,459
He does not answer the question until the third chapter.

571
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,279
We'll look at it in more detail next week.

572
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,899
But notice in verse number five of chapter three,

573
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,319
not that we are sufficient of ourselves

574
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,559
to think anything as of ourselves,

575
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,439
but our sufficiency is of God.

576
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,459
Our sufficiency is of God.

577
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,119
Then notice what he says in verse 17.

578
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,959
As we think about this strategy here,

579
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,559
the Bible says that for we are not as many

580
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,419
which corrupt the word of God,

581
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,139
but as of sincerity, but as of God,

582
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:54,539
in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

583
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,439
You know what Paul's saying in verse number 17?

584
00:31:56,439 --> 00:32:00,599
He's making a contrast and a distinction

585
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,319
between the ministry that Paul was engaged in

586
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,699
and the ministry that he's going to be speaking about

587
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,279
for several chapters now.

588
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,999
And what a joy it is, again,

589
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:12,519
to understand the philosophy and perspective

590
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,619
of ministry that is outlined in these chapters

591
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:17,119
in the book of 2 Corinthians.

592
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,319
But he's making this contrast and this distinction

593
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,319
between his ministry and the ministry of false teachers.

594
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,699
The ministry of those that were corrupting the word of God,

595
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,139
the ministry of those that were going out

596
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,819
and they were trying to use the scriptures

597
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:35,779
to say something that they did not say

598
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:39,699
in order to have some level of control over individuals

599
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:43,459
and in order that they might profit with all.

600
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:46,039
And Paul says, no, no, no, that's not me.

601
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,619
That's not us.

602
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:50,299
We don't corrupt the word of God.

603
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:55,079
We understand that Paul taught and was very plain

604
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,119
in giving the instruction of the importance

605
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,439
of preaching what?

606
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,279
The word.

607
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,479
He was not one that was going to try

608
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,479
to manipulate the word of God

609
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,639
and make it say something that it did not say

610
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:08,039
so that he might profit.

611
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,399
No, that was not his approach to ministry.

612
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,879
Why was that not his approach to ministry?

613
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,639
Well, because he stood before God.

614
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,359
Remember we talked about in our study

615
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,619
in chapter number one when you're misunderstood

616
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:23,139
and we talked about the fact that Paul

617
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:25,339
had this clear conscience, he examined himself,

618
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,179
he understood what it was to live in the presence of God.

619
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:31,339
He understood what it was to be accountable to God.

620
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,499
We find that Paul says, no, that's not how we do ministry.

621
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:35,619
In fact, when he's there

622
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,459
and during the first missionary journey,

623
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,779
if you read through the scriptures,

624
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,419
they're ready to make sacrifices on the behalf of Paul.

625
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,219
I mean, they're ready to worship Paul

626
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,059
and they're ready to get,

627
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,659
I think they could give Paul whatever Paul asked for

628
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,479
and Paul says, no, no, no.

629
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,739
I mean, I'm here to declare the real, the true God,

630
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,359
the living God, that's what I'm here for.

631
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,059
God used Paul to see many people saved.

632
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,319
God used Paul to see many churches established.

633
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,899
God used Paul to see people healed of infirmities

634
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:06,339
and all that took place.

635
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:10,539
And yet Paul never sought to benefit from those things.

636
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:13,039
He simply pointed people to Jesus.

637
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:16,019
And that's where you see the strategy.

638
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:18,039
Why was Paul, why did he,

639
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,019
why was his life a life that was marked by victory?

640
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,019
Well, he understood that the source of victory

641
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:25,499
is the Lord Jesus Christ.

642
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:26,819
And now thanks be unto God,

643
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:30,139
which always causeth us to triumph in Christ.

644
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,019
But he understood that there was an important aspect

645
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,759
of ministry and how we serve the Lord

646
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,359
and the victory that we can have.

647
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,899
And he says in verse 17,

648
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,719
we are not as many which corrupt the word of God,

649
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,339
but as of sincerity,

650
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:47,079
the reality is that we must live in full dependence,

651
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,499
as he said, who is sufficient for these things?

652
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:54,159
Not me, not you, our sufficiency is of God.

653
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,699
But we also understand that there must be integrity,

654
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,319
there must be sincerity.

655
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,519
What does God's word say?

656
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:04,819
That's what we're gonna live by.

657
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:07,859
Let God be true and every man a liar.

658
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,659
The Bereans are commended, why?

659
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,719
Because they search the scriptures daily,

660
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,139
whether these things be.

661
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,519
Listen, we're in a place where I encourage people

662
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,199
to read their Bibles.

663
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,499
We give you a daily reading Bible schedules,

664
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:25,359
we provide you with an admonition,

665
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,919
an instruction, an encouragement,

666
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:31,919
read the scriptures, dig in the Bible, read God's word.

667
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,719
If I was preaching something contrary

668
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,899
to what this book taught,

669
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,399
I wouldn't encourage you to read the Bible

670
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,459
because I'd be exposed as a fraud.

671
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,719
You know, there are some denominations historically

672
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:48,919
that would forbid their people from reading the Bible.

673
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,259
Why?

674
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,459
Because as long as they could keep a distinction

675
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:56,499
and a separation between them and the people,

676
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,139
they had a level of control.

677
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,259
You read it historically, I'm not making it up.

678
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,859
You can read it historically.

679
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:07,019
In fact, I made this statement years ago.

680
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,379
It was probably 12 and a half years ago, 13 years ago.

681
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:11,899
I was teaching right down here on a Wednesday evening

682
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,679
and I was teaching on sound doctrine

683
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,159
and I made this statement about denominations

684
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,879
that simply did not encourage people to read the Bible.

685
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,479
That was the terminology that I used.

686
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:24,839
And Marianne Cook came up to me after the service

687
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,659
and she said, pastor, I want you to understand,

688
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,359
it wasn't that they didn't encourage us,

689
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,179
they forbid us from reading the Bible.

690
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:34,399
She said, I remember as a little girl,

691
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,759
I remember mentioning in my school that I read the Bible

692
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:41,259
and I had my knuckles smacked with rulers.

693
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,159
Because I read the Bible.

694
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,919
No, no, we encourage you to read the Bible.

695
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:50,839
You need to read the Bible.

696
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,679
You ought to get a good Bible message from this pulpit

697
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,639
every time I open the Bible.

698
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,679
It's my job to feed the flock of God.

699
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,239
But what I give you from this pulpit

700
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,799
is not enough for you all week.

701
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:04,959
It's just not.

702
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,999
And Paul says that he understood at the end of verse 17

703
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:15,659
that in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.

704
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:18,539
Paul understood who the authority was.

705
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,579
Paul understood that he was in submission to God Almighty

706
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:25,979
and that God was the one that had called him.

707
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:27,779
He mentions it in chapter number one,

708
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,059
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

709
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,219
And he understood that it was God who equipped him.

710
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,699
It was God who had taught him.

711
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,139
You read Galatians one.

712
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:37,779
This teaching that he was giving

713
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:39,499
was not something that he learned of many,

714
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,319
but he learned it by Jesus Christ,

715
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,079
of the revelation of Jesus Christ

716
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,359
is the way that he mentions it in Galatians one.

717
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,879
And the reality this morning is that he says,

718
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:53,059
in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.

719
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,679
That's a heavy statement if you're manipulating someone.

720
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:02,059
But if you're not manipulating,

721
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,879
if you're preaching with sincerity,

722
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:06,719
you're not corrupting the word of God,

723
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,879
you freely let people know,

724
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,079
listen, I'm doing this in the sight of God.

725
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:14,059
We know it's true whether you're corrupting or not.

726
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,419
God sees and knows everything.

727
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,339
But the reality this morning is that Paul says,

728
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,179
listen, this is the strategy for victory.

729
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,379
He's the source of victory.

730
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,539
I must live in full dependence upon him.

731
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:27,019
I must operate with integrity and with sincerity.

732
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:30,659
And I must trust him for the victory that only he can give.

733
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:33,419
Can remind you this morning

734
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:36,359
of two Old Testament passages of scripture.

735
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:41,159
Joshua chapter number seven and Judges chapter number seven.

736
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,019
Oftentimes we look at the book of Joshua as being,

737
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,259
again, as I mentioned earlier in the message this morning,

738
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,899
being a picture of the victorious Christian life.

739
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:51,919
And certainly it is.

740
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:54,419
I understand there's some hymns from old years

741
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:56,259
and there's some preachers from old years

742
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:57,619
that would say that the book of Joshua

743
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:58,739
is a picture of heaven.

744
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,839
I cannot disagree with that more

745
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,659
than I'm disagreeing with it right now.

746
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,499
It's not a picture of heaven

747
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,199
because there is sin in the book of Joshua.

748
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,999
There is no sin in heaven.

749
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,859
There is war in the book of Joshua.

750
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:13,719
There is no war in heaven.

751
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,159
It is not a picture of heaven.

752
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,479
You say, but so-and-so pastor said it was.

753
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,719
I'm sorry, okay?

754
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,359
This is not a picture of heaven.

755
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,639
It is a picture of the victorious Christian life.

756
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,559
You know what happens in the victorious Christian life?

757
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,399
You have victory,

758
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:37,339
but you have constant enemies coming after you.

759
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,619
You can have victory.

760
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,899
You know, the only defeat they had was an AI.

761
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,859
You study the whole book of Joshua,

762
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,899
the only defeat they had was an AI.

763
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:50,979
And I believe there's one main reason for that defeat,

764
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:53,059
but there's also a secondary reason.

765
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:56,599
The main reason is sin in the camp.

766
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,459
That's a great example for all of us.

767
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,299
If we're sin,

768
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:04,659
We're not going to have the victory that God has provided for us.

769
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:09,899
But we see also that there was a measure of self-dependence.

770
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:13,299
In Joshua chapter 7 and verse number 3, the Bible says that they returned to Joshua.

771
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:17,979
Joshua sent them out to go and to spy out, to check out what was going on, to view the

772
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:19,499
country according to verse 2.

773
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:23,539
And the Bible says that they come back and here's what they say, let not all the people

774
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:31,139
go up, but let about 2,000 or 3,000 men go up and smite AI, and make not all the people

775
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,979
to labor that thither, for they are but few.

776
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:38,859
Can I tell you, that was a mistake.

777
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,599
Sin in the camp is the primary reason for defeat.

778
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,099
But the secondary reason was self-dependence.

779
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,539
Joshua, don't make all of us go, I mean we can handle this one.

780
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,259
You know what happens in your life?

781
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:55,219
You start getting self-dependent.

782
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,219
You experience some victory.

783
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,499
You know what happened in the life, in the book of Joshua?

784
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:01,019
They had experienced some victory.

785
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,859
They experienced some victory.

786
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,859
You know what happens in your life when you experience victory?

787
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:09,419
All of a sudden you think, I can be victorious.

788
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:14,339
And I forget the fact that it was God who made me victorious.

789
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,699
I forget the source.

790
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:20,479
And I violate the strategy.

791
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,759
And I suffer defeat.

792
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:28,759
If you look through the Scripture, some of the most difficult days for God's people

793
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:31,239
were on the heels of victory.

794
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,519
On the heels of victory.

795
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,919
Why is that so?

796
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:38,639
Because it's when we become most self-dependent.

797
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,799
Look at what we were able to see done.

798
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:40,799
I mean, look at this.

799
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:41,799
This is awesome.

800
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:49,159
And we start thinking, we did this.

801
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:55,039
And then we enter the next one and we find out real fast.

802
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,319
Defeat.

803
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,639
See Joshua 7 is an important reminder for us.

804
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:09,479
Judges chapter 7, the life of Gideon, we're familiar with again, two passages that we're

805
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:10,479
familiar with.

806
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:21,039
I just want to remind you of what the Lord says to Gideon in Judges chapter number 7.

807
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,519
In verse number 2, the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Gideon, the people that are

808
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,319
with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands.

809
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,319
Why?

810
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,199
Why was it too many?

811
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:39,119
Lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

812
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:43,759
You know what a danger is for us?

813
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,559
We think we did it.

814
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,879
Forget the source.

815
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:56,519
Verse 7, the Lord said unto Gideon, by the 300 men that lapped will I save you and deliver

816
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,079
the Midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place.

817
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,999
You know what God did?

818
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:11,799
God gave them a victory that could only be explained as God did it.

819
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:16,679
There's no other way to explain it but to say God did it.

820
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,779
And that's what God wants in our lives.

821
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:25,679
He wants us to have victory, but He wants us to acknowledge as Paul did, we are more

822
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,279
than conquerors through Him that loved us.

823
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:33,879
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

824
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:40,879
You see, Paul was opposed, Paul was misunderstood, yet he knew victory came through Christ and

825
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:43,679
he was rejoicing.

826
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,239
He started the passage with thanks, with rejoicing.

827
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:53,119
He says, now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ.

828
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,359
I wonder this morning, are you experiencing victory in your life?

829
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,159
Are you experiencing victory in your life?

830
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,719
I mean, day by day, you're experiencing victory.

831
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,559
You've seen the song, Victory in Jesus.

832
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:13,119
And we understand that one day we will see Him face to face and what a glorious day that

833
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,119
will be.

834
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,319
But understand with me here today, God wants you to be victorious today and tomorrow and

835
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,519
the next day and He wants you to have victory.

836
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,679
He's provided for you.

837
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,619
He is the source of victory.

838
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:30,439
He does not want His people to live defeated lives.

839
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,999
You say, but pastor, we have an enemy.

840
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:32,999
Yes, we do.

841
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:36,759
The Bible says that we can quench all the fiery darts of the enemy with that shield

842
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:37,759
of faith.

843
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,759
Is the Bible true?

844
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,759
Absolutely.

845
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:40,759
It's what it says.

846
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:49,239
The Bible says we're to take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.

847
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,719
We have victory through Jesus.

848
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,039
He's given us all that we need to have victory.

849
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:03,919
But what makes me so sad is I know so many Christians.

850
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:13,439
I know so many Christians that are living lives of defeat and yet victory is available.

851
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:16,259
Victory is available.

852
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:18,319
They're not surrendering.

853
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,119
They're not yielding.

854
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:30,119
They're walking in the flesh, not in the Spirit, and they're living defeated lives.

855
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,959
Can I tell you this morning, that's not what God intends for you.

856
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,599
He intends that you'd be victorious.

857
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,359
Victory in Jesus.

858
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:39,359
Let's pray.

859
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,359
Father, we love you.

860
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:43,399
We thank you for loving us.

861
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:53,719
I pray, God, that you would help each of us to regularly experience victory in our lives.

862
00:45:53,719 --> 00:46:03,279
Or maybe somebody this morning, just living defeated, defeated lives, oh, God, would you

863
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:05,279
help them?

864
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:11,879
Would you help them this morning to understand that we're more than conquerors through Him

865
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:12,879
that loved us?

866
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:19,279
Would you help them this morning to understand the source of victory and the strategy, the

867
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:27,159
importance of surrender and dependence and integrity and sincerity?

868
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,319
We no longer would live defeated lives.

869
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,199
God, would you work in hearts and lives as only you can?

870
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,239
Maybe there's one that's not saved.

871
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:43,799
Maybe one day they need to come and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to be their Savior.

872
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:49,559
And I pray that you'd move and work in that life as only you can.

873
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,599
I pray that in these moments, that you would have your will and way, and we'll thank you

874
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,599
for it.

875
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:57,599
In Christ's name we pray.

876
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,599
Would you stand with me?

877
00:46:58,599 --> 00:46:59,919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

878
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:03,799
Holly's going to play quietly on the piano.

879
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:05,799
As Holly plays, the altar is open.
