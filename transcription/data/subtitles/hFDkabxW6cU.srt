1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
if you would, and turn with me to Luke chapter 18. Luke chapter 18. I'll read the

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,360
scripture in just a moment. Let me start off with just a few comments and it'll

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,040
be a little bit of a different message. I'm going to preach a topical message

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,680
instead of just from one passage tonight. But I want to say, and I believe what I'm

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,959
about to say is true for all of us in this room and true for those who are

6
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:38,040
listening by live stream, I think we could say that all of us want to have

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,360
power with God. We want to have the power of God on our lives. But I've used that

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,319
phrase so often and I hear it so much that sometimes it becomes a phrase

9
00:00:53,319 --> 00:01:00,439
that we use that we don't know exactly what is meant by it. So when I say I

10
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,400
want to have the power of God, power with God, let me say what I mean. Just a few

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,559
things. Number one, I mean that I want to have people drawn to me because they see

12
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:21,720
Christ in my life and then have influence in their lives to see them

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:30,639
trust Jesus as their Savior. When I say I want power, the power of God, I mean

14
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:39,199
that I want to have the strength to say no to sin, to say no to habits, and have

15
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:47,760
victory over them instead of them having victory over me. When I say I want the

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,080
power of God, I mean that I want to open this word and read it and understand it

17
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:03,000
and be able to communicate it and have a rich life in the word of God. When I say

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,639
I want the power of God, I want to have children that grow up not only knowing

19
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,559
the Lord, and I'd be glad if they knew the Lord, but I want them to love the

20
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:21,639
Lord, and I want them to serve the Lord. Whatever God calls them to vocation in

21
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,160
their life is fine, but I want them to serve the Lord. When I say I want power

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,520
with God, I mean I want the grace of God on my life so that even in the deepest

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:45,759
trials, my life is a testimony of deep and settled trust and joy that God

24
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:53,559
knows where I am, and God knows what I need, and God will meet my need. When I

25
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:59,199
say that's what I mean by the power of God, I think most believers would say,

26
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:07,160
yes, that's what I want. That's what I want my life to be. Well, I'll say this, if

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,800
we are ever to have that kind of power with our Lord, if we're ever going to

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,639
have that kind of real revival spirit in our homes, in our churches, in our

29
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:30,639
communities, it will only come when we from committed hearts have a consistent

30
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:41,479
time of prayer, both private and community, with our God. The missing

31
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:48,839
element in our lives today, the weakest element in our lives today, if we were

32
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:56,240
absolutely transparent, is our prayer lives. We know how to go to church. We

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,960
know how to give. We know how to go through the motions. We know how to do

34
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,160
church stuff. We're very good at it. And please do not hear me denigrating,

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,839
diminishing, minimizing anyone's service to the Lord. I just know a truth. I know

36
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,839
that in each of our hearts, that deep there really beats this desire for it

37
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:28,320
not just to be outward form, but for it to be vital and vibrant and real. And the

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,700
only way it will happen, as I said, is if we will find our ways back to our prayer

39
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,000
closets. Most people don't even know what that term means anymore, but to

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,959
find that time of consistent, committed prayer, both meditating upon His Word and

41
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:56,959
communing with Him, listening to Him, asking Him, and communicating with Him. So

42
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,239
the purpose of my message tonight is simply this. If that's the key to power

43
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:09,679
with God, and prayer is the answer, I just want to give you three simple glimpses

44
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:17,679
of why you and I ought to dedicate ourselves to a consistent and committed

45
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:22,880
life of prayer. Now to do that, I'm going to go to three different sets of

46
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,279
scripture. We're going to start here in Luke chapter 18, and let's begin our

47
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:37,239
reading in verse 1. And He spake a parable unto them to this end. I'll stop

48
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:43,480
there just a moment. We're going to read a parable, and a parable usually

49
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:50,480
expresses one great truth. Now here's the great truth that this parable

50
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,760
expresses. He's giving it to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to

51
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,640
faint. And now He's going to give us the illustration in the parable. The point is

52
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:09,679
that men ought always to pray and not to faint. They ought to be committed to it.

53
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:15,279
They ought to be consistent with it. They ought to pray. It's a command. Now notice

54
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:22,040
the illustration, verse 2, saying, There was in a city a judge which feared not

55
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,720
God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto

56
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,799
him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for a while. But

57
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:42,880
afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet

58
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,359
because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming

59
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:58,440
she weary me. Now that's the illustration of the truth, men ought always to pray

60
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:07,279
and not to faint. The story tells us that this woman, who was a widow, and let's

61
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,079
understand that a widow was perhaps one of the most helpless people in the

62
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,320
culture in Bible times. She had no means of support unless she had children, and

63
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,959
they were supporting her. It was a, it was a very precarious thing to be, a widow.

64
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:32,040
And she had a need, she had a real need, and she understood that the only way

65
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,359
that her need could be met was for her to appeal to this certain judge, this

66
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:46,239
man of prominence. And so because she knew her need, and knew that her

67
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:52,679
need could only be met this way, she went to that man. Perhaps when she first went,

68
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,160
she had an audience with him, and he didn't respond to her, but maybe she made

69
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,839
a second appointment, and he didn't respond to her. I don't think it's out of

70
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,440
the question that maybe he finally told her, stop coming here, I'm not going to do

71
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
anything. And maybe she stood outside of his window, and just continued to call

72
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,799
upon him, and to call upon him, and to call upon him. And the great end of the

73
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:23,399
story is, is that with fervor, and constancy, and perseverance, she finally

74
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:33,559
had her need met by this man because of her perseverance. Now you say, preacher, I

75
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,440
get that, what's so deep about that? Well let me, let me say this, did you know that

76
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,320
no one had to coach that woman on what to ask for? She did not have to attend a

77
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,479
seminar so that she would understand how she should ask for this thing. Nobody had

78
00:08:54,479 --> 00:09:00,200
to coach her on who to go to, nobody had to coach her on what days of the week, or

79
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:08,039
what hours of the day. She had a need, and there was only one person, one place that

80
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:15,919
that need could be met, and she went over, and over, and over again until that need

81
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:22,599
was met. Did you know that no one had to coach blind Bartimaeus on what to pray

82
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:32,039
for? He had a need. He knew what his need was. He was blind, and he needed to see. No

83
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,760
one had to have a seminar for women with issues of blood. The woman that had the

84
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,679
issue of the blood knew some things. She knew that she had gone to all the

85
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,200
physicians, and expended all that she had trying to get this disease healed, and

86
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,679
there were none that could heal her, and there was nothing she had else to offer.

87
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,880
But she knew there was one man that if she could get to him, even touching the

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,799
hem of his garment, no one

89
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,999
had to tell her who to get to, or what to say, or what to do. Did you know that no

90
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,519
one had to tell Jairus when his daughter lay dying that he needed to appeal to

91
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:22,799
this one named Jesus? You say, preacher, does all of this have a point? Yes. All of

92
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:29,919
these people who we saw successfully ask the Lord for something and get an answer

93
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,199
had one great thing in common. It wasn't that they had the same issue, wasn't that

94
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:41,199
they had the same background, wasn't that they had the same means. It was that they

95
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:50,919
knew they had a need that no one else could answer. Now what I just said is

96
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:59,039
incredibly profound. Not because I said it, but because I think therein lies the

97
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,439
reason that the weakest part of our Christian lives is our prayer life. You

98
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:13,919
know why? Our problem is we don't know how needy we are, and we don't understand

99
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:21,619
that only God can give to us and supply for us what we need in our lives as

100
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:32,419
believers. We don't pray as we should because we think we can get by without

101
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:40,219
it. Let that sink in for just a moment. I don't mean to sound scolding or harsh,

102
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:48,539
but I believe it's true. You see, praying is very hard work, and it's not work that

103
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,699
anyone truly sees. I've learned over the years it's a whole lot easier to preach

104
00:11:53,699 --> 00:12:00,179
than it is to pray. Hey, I've gone to Bible college. What's that mean, preacher? It

105
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:06,139
means I've learned where to find good outlines. No, it means I've learned how

106
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,739
to outline Scripture. It means I've learned laws of hermeneutics. It means

107
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:15,939
I've learned where great resources, reference resources are. It means that

108
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,099
I've learned how homiletically to put an outline together and hermeneutically

109
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:27,019
that is sound and correct. And I want to tell you, that's hard work, but I know how

110
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:35,499
to do that, and I can do that. But all of my homiletics and all of my hermeneutics

111
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:44,979
that are a work of my intellect are just exactly that, without the power and the

112
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:52,139
Spirit of God. And here's the truth, and again I don't mean to be mean-spirited

113
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,699
in what I say. Folks, there are thousands of pulpits in America every Sunday

114
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:05,419
morning that has a man walk to that pulpit and lay his notes down and preach

115
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:14,699
a sermon that may be biblically correct, but has not had one ounce of prayer

116
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:21,499
asking God to take his word and apply it to the hearts of men. You know why?

117
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:27,979
Because it's easier to preach than to pray, and it's more rewarding in the

118
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:34,859
short term to preach than to pray. Did you know it's easier to go visiting than

119
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:43,139
to pray that God will lead you to a soul? I'm just saying to you that prayer

120
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:51,139
is hard work, and yet how can we expect to have God's power if He sees in our

121
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:58,779
lives what we know to be true in our lives, that our work for Him is religious

122
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:06,139
work? It's work that we put together. It's work that our intellect created. I'm not

123
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,139
saying that there's not a part for our talent, our gift, our intellect, but my

124
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:18,619
friend, no revival will come through anything that Mike Edwards does without

125
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:26,579
the imprint and the power of God on it. I don't understand how Sunday school

126
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:32,299
teachers teach Sunday school lessons without prayer. I don't understand how

127
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:37,019
junior church workers, well they're just kids, yeah they're just kids with an

128
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:43,220
immortal soul. They're just kids that need the gospel, and they need the

129
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,859
entrance of the gospel into our heart, and we take it so lightly, we are so

130
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:52,940
flippant about it, we think that a flannel graph and a story that we

131
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,899
present is what's necessary and what is vital for eternity, and I'm just simply

132
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,179
saying to you that our work can accomplish some things, but it can never

133
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:10,259
accomplish what God's power on that presentation can accomplish, and yet

134
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,539
millions of Sunday school classes are taught without a moment's prayer. Many

135
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:23,419
junior churches are preached, business meetings, out in the secular world, job

136
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:31,099
interviews, family time, family things. I'm just telling you that on and on and on we

137
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:38,139
have come to the place where we think we can do it on our own, where we think that

138
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:44,539
what we bring to it is enough. Hey, we want revival, we want to have revival, and

139
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:51,459
we schedule a meeting, and we preach the sermons, and we put out the brochures, but

140
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:58,179
revival has never come from a pulpit.

141
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:07,819
Revival has never come from a preacher where first there was not prayer, bathing,

142
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:18,059
preparing, begging God to work. And by our lifestyle, by how we operate in our

143
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:25,699
lives, do you know the message we send to God? I've got this. I've got this. Well, of

144
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:31,940
course we pray. We pray gratefully over our food, and I'm glad of that. Hey, we

145
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:38,419
love our children, and we pray for our children, and we pray for family and parents, but

146
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:44,299
I'm telling you, it is so much bigger than the three-foot circle that surrounds us.

147
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:51,059
There is a world that needs believers to find the time and the discipline of life

148
00:16:51,059 --> 00:17:01,619
to beg God to do what none of us can do without Him. And we say we want that, but

149
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:10,739
the manner in which we live says, I've got this. I'll come to you when I really

150
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:16,979
need you. And unlike this little woman, we don't understand that we are just as

151
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:27,220
desperate, just as destitute, just as unable by ourselves to accomplish spiritually what

152
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:34,099
we need to accomplish without pleading and knowing and walking with God and

153
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:40,299
having His power. Men are always to pray. Turn with me to James chapter 5 and verse

154
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:53,819
16. James chapter 5 and verse 16. Very familiar passage. There the scripture says

155
00:17:53,819 --> 00:18:01,699
this, confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be

156
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:07,699
healed. Here's the phrase I want to concentrate on, the effectual fervent

157
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:16,059
prayer of a righteous man availeth much. I don't suppose there's any more motivating

158
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,659
verse in my mind in the Word of God for right living in prayer than that phrase

159
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:29,979
in that verse right there. That if I will pray and my life is in a place

160
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:39,099
where it is walking with the Lord that I can pray fervently and my prayer can

161
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:51,459
impact what I pray about. Is that what God is saying? I want to say it again, I didn't say it well. I can pray and because God is

162
00:18:51,459 --> 00:19:21,380
working through my prayer, I can impact what needs to be changed or impacted. That's what the Bible says. That is a promise of God that says, hey, you see a hurt? Did you know that if you can pray about that hurt, I can work in that hurt? Hey, you see something that you're fearful about in someone's life? Hey, pray about that and I can impact that. Hey, you have

163
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:39,219
a need? Hey, you have a fear? Hey, you have a hurt in your heart? Pray! Pray! Pray! I can work in that, but it's hard work to pray, and it takes time to pray. There's a word called

164
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:48,179
intercession, and the truth is we rejoice in the fact that Jesus stands in the

165
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,059
presence of the Father as our advocate, and when the accuser of the brethren,

166
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:58,940
Satan, comes before the Lord, and by the way, in our lives there is plenty to

167
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,140
accuse, wouldn't you say?

168
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,260
we rejoice in the fact that our Advocate, Jesus, stands up for us and intercedes

169
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,020
for us, and pleads the blood for us, and God sees the blood of His Son in us,

170
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:22,660
forgives us, restores us. Hey, I am glad that in me, you don't see it, I don't see

171
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,780
it in you, I see the effect, we have the Holy Spirit within us, and I rejoice in

172
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,020
the fact that the Holy Spirit intercedes for me, that He

173
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,900
pleads to God with me in groanings that I can't utter, can't understand, but He

174
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:47,740
pleads for me, thank God He intercedes for me. But we never catch the view that

175
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,580
as Christ and as the Holy Spirit intercede for us, we ought to be an

176
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,420
Advocate and intercede for others. Let me walk through the scripture just a

177
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,540
moment, don't turn to these for the sake of time. I love in Numbers chapter 11

178
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:11,180
verse 1, just listen as I read, it's about Moses. It says, And when the people

179
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:18,740
complained, it displeased the Lord. And the Lord heard it, and His anger was

180
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,700
kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were

181
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,940
in the uttermost parts of the camp. And the people cried unto Moses. And when

182
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:45,980
Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched. Well, we're not Moses. Hey, Moses

183
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,180
was created out of the same dust that you and I are created. Stop letting

184
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:59,860
ourselves off because our name doesn't appear in the Bible. Moses was a meek man,

185
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,020
Moses was a flawed man, Moses was a man that God had to put on the backside of

186
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:12,260
the desert for 40 years to teach him this, but Moses got it and became a man

187
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,060
who walked with God, who was able to offer an effectual, fervent prayer, and he

188
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:28,220
interceded for his people, and the fire stopped. Every pastor ought to have a

189
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:34,940
burning in his soul to be able to pray for the fire to stop in the families

190
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,420
that he pastors, in the lives of those teens that he pastors, in the attacks

191
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,740
upon the church. He ought to be an intercessor. It ought to be a vital part

192
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:55,420
of every ministry. Yet, we don't have time for it. Every parent ought to be an

193
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:03,220
intercessor, ought to be praying for that fire to stop, for that to stop before it

194
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,540
gets to that child, before it gets to that home. Every parent ought to have

195
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,180
time because he needs to intercede for his children, for his home, and he

196
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,500
ought to understand that no matter how loudly he cheers on the soccer sideline,

197
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,500
or how cool a dad he is when he does this or that, or how many activities they

198
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,940
have, the devil doesn't care about that! He is after your home! And I don't care

199
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,700
how many activities you schedule, and how sweet you are, and how many gifts you buy,

200
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:48,300
only the effectual, fervent prayer and God's intervention will stop that work.

201
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Hey folks, we need to wake up. Hey God, how do I got three kids? I got this, going to

202
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,620
the soccer game. Hey God, I got this! We got a program at church that'll take

203
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:18,940
care of that. God looks at us and says, well, we'll see if you got it. I read

204
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:29,300
about Elijah, 1 Kings chapter 18, Lord God of Abraham, he begins to pray, and of

205
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am

206
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,340
thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. And when he

207
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,420
prayed that brief prayer, you know what happened? Fire fell. And you know what

208
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,820
the purpose of that fire falling was? So that Israel would know who the real God

209
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:03,540
was. For hours and hours, the prophets of Baal had danced around that sacrifice, cut

210
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:09,820
themselves, and plead for their God to throw fire. Baal is not real. He couldn't

211
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:18,420
throw fire down. But in that prayer, Elijah showed the world who was God. I

212
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,540
don't want to be true dramatic in this, but I want to be able to demonstrate to

213
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:34,020
this world who God is. Our churches ought to be places where people find God. Our

214
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,500
living rooms ought to be places where people find God. When somebody

215
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,020
fellowships with us, they ought to be able to find God, because we make God

216
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:56,860
known through the way we live and through what we are. I got it, God. We've

217
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,940
got a visitation program. That'll work. And it will work. I'm glad for it. But I'm

218
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,140
telling you, all the distribution, letterboxing, all the programs and all

219
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:21,220
the seminars, without the power of God to make Himself known, we work so hard at

220
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:31,340
all the stuff, and we forget the most vital aspect, God's power. I think of

221
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:38,540
Hezekiah. Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it.

222
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,260
Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, spread it before the Lord, and

223
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,180
Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said, O Lord God of Israel. And he went on and

224
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,300
read that letter of how they were going to destroy the city. And God's

225
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,900
answer came just a few verses later. God answers and says, Therefore, thus saith

226
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,380
the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into this city, nor

227
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,100
shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

228
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:20,580
Would to God we could stop Satan in his tracks. Every father and mother needs the

229
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,900
power to pray Satan away from the walls of their home and the hearts of their

230
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:33,540
children. I don't want to over dramatize this, but I'm 70 years old, and I'm

231
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,900
telling you, I ain't never seen it like this. There's always been sin, but it has

232
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,020
never been so obvious. And our teenagers, our children, I'm not saying they can't

233
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,700
succeed. They can. They can have marvelous testimonies, but it's not by saying, I got

234
00:27:51,700 --> 00:28:02,260
this. Taking them to Disney, that'll do it. Hey, I'm not against that, but if you

235
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:12,380
think being a cool dad, being a cool mom will stop Satan from their hearts, you're

236
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:20,740
wrong. And you and I need to be intercessors. Well, I pray for my children.

237
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:31,580
Well, how long do you pray? What do you pray for? How often do you pray? You pray

238
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,380
when the test? You pray when the crisis? Or is it a part of your life where every

239
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,460
day, significant time in intercessory prayer for each and every one of your

240
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,900
children, for your spouse, for your extended family, for your church? Are you

241
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:57,500
an intercessor? And I'm saying to you, we read the effectual, fervent prayer of a

242
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,980
righteous man availeth much, and never put it into practice. We're glad it's

243
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:16,380
there. We hope the preacher's doing it, but we never put it into practice. It takes

244
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:26,140
time. You see, power with God is not microwavable. Power with God isn't

245
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,900
something we shake up and pour out and cook. Power with God is commitment of

246
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:39,020
time, commitment of energy, not just physical, mental energy. And saying, I'm

247
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,580
going to do this. Power with God requires not only the discipline of time, but the

248
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,140
discipline of thought. We've got to write things down. We've got to

249
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,299
know what we're praying for. We've got to know when we prayed for it last, and when

250
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:56,220
we're going to pray for it again. We've got to be specific about it. It takes

251
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:04,100
time, but if we can't put it in a microwave, I gotta work, oh we gotta...

252
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:11,180
this activity oh we got I got a God I'll get with I'll catch up with you and we

253
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:18,560
think we can do it by ourselves one last scripture would you look with me at

254
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:35,760
Matthew 26 Matthew 26 and verse 36 I'll be quick Matthew 26 and verse 36 and we

255
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,320
begin reading we're going to read about 10 verses then cometh Jesus with them

256
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,040
unto a place called Gethsemane and sayeth unto the disciples sit ye here

257
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,280
while I go and pray yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of

258
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,200
Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my

259
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,880
soul is exciting sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me

260
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,980
pray with me others passages will reveal and he went a little further and fell on

261
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,620
his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from

262
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,700
me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto his

263
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:34,540
disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter what could could could

264
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:45,140
you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into

265
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,980
temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again

266
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,660
the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cup may not pass away

267
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:02,380
from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep

268
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:10,220
again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went again and prayed the

269
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:20,380
third time saying the same words I just give me a moment and I'll be done Jesus

270
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,980
brought his inner disciple his inner circle those that he felt he was closest

271
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,260
to those he felt that would truly understand and and they come to the

272
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,060
garden of Gethsemane and understand what night this is this is the night of

273
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:43,620
his passion he is only hours away from arrest hours away from the cross and as

274
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,700
they come to this place his soul is heavy and he looks to his disciples and

275
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:56,340
he says I want you to watch with me in other words be aware with me and pray

276
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,060
with me and and I'm gonna go over here and pray but I want you to pray here and

277
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,780
they looked at him and they could tell that it was heavy he was sorrowing he

278
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,940
was really deeply distressed over what he was talking about he went over and we

279
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,900
know the story prayed and he prayed and he prayed he looked into the cup of our

280
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,420
sin and and knew that he had to drink that cup if we were ever to be made one

281
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:29,180
again with God and and to be honest with you it was a decision point is he going

282
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,020
to go to the cross or is he going to say no it's it's too heavy I don't want to

283
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:47,220
carry it and he comes back to his disciples and he finds them asleep and

284
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:58,420
he says to them and I'm going to put some words in his mouth what you saw how

285
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:07,420
heavy this was you saw how in distress I was you saw me fall down you may have

286
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:15,900
even heard the cry of my heart and and what you're asleep could you could you

287
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:26,340
not give me an hour the greatest spiritual battle the world has ever

288
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:37,700
known is going on 20 feet from those disciples and in that proximity of the

289
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:47,620
greatest spiritual battle the world has ever known the disciples slept I think

290
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:54,020
there's a lesson there for us we have come to this place in our nation in our

291
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,180
culture in our world folks I don't know I don't know that it's ever been more

292
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:10,340
serious certainly sin is abounding and hearts are getting colder certainly the

293
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:22,740
need is greater and and we think that this is the time to say I got it I'll

294
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,620
pray when I need to you know what I'm fearing I'm fearing that a great

295
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,740
spiritual battle is right outside our office door and we don't have time to

296
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,220
pray I'm afraid that a great spiritual battle or maybe a great spiritual

297
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:45,860
opportunity is afoot in this community but we don't have time to pray I fear

298
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:52,180
that that there are teenagers who are moments from an onslaught from the devil

299
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:59,140
and his hordes and there's dads who don't have time to pray and moms who

300
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:07,980
think it's time to take a nap and I think the Lord looks at us and says in

301
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:19,540
our vernacular dude don't you get it it's time to pray the spiritual battle

302
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:30,180
of your life surrounds you and you can't find time to plead with God to

303
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:40,020
work through you to work in the hearts of those you love hey I'd say it's time

304
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:46,940
that Christians have to stop messing with it and have to say if there's gonna

305
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:56,340
be revival in my heart if there's gonna be revival in my marriage if there's

306
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:06,020
gonna be revival in my home in my church in my community I've got to stop saying

307
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:13,980
I've got this I've got to stop thinking that our program is all we need I've

308
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,620
got to stop thinking that my intellect my activity my gift that's all we need

309
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,300
now and I'll ask God to bless it but folks I'm telling you the missing

310
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:34,820
ingredient is not a better program it's not better music it's not new carpet or

311
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:43,260
a bigger building it's prayer and begging God to do what we cannot do but

312
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:58,180
he could do through us men ought always to pray and not quit because the

313
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,700
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and the greatest

314
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,580
spiritual battle that our world our lives have ever seen or known is raging

315
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:20,140
around us can't you pray can't you watch with me can't you be serious about this

316
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:29,220
can't you intercede can't you can't you call upon me to work I'm simply saying

317
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:38,660
it is time for us to pray say preacher what do you mean I mean dedicated

318
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:47,140
committed disciplined prayer times of praise times of thanksgiving times of

319
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:55,900
confession of sin interceding for others making petition for ourselves praising

320
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:03,260
again and and coming with decision from it it is time to pray and this I finish

321
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:11,620
if revival is a set of meetings and it's done on Wednesday night revivals not

322
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:22,020
coming but when a believer will say I'm going to watch and pray with him and I'm

323
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,340
going to plead with my God to work through my life and they become

324
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:38,540
disciplined and committed to pray then revival would you pray with me father we

325
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,660
thank you tonight for your blessing and for your help or I pray that you would

326
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:57,020
create a first hunger we've become so accustomed to doing church how we do

327
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,540
church that we think the powers and how we do church

328
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,460
We've become so accustomed to think that it's what we do that makes a difference,

329
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:16,440
and it really never is. But at our fingertips is the greatest power the

330
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,300
universe knows, the power of God. And Satan really can be stopped. People

331
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,980
really can be helped. Families really can succeed. Teens really can honor you. All

332
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:38,300
of these things can be true. And it's not happenstance. It's not accident. But

333
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:46,780
when we don't sense the need, when we think what we do is enough, Lord, we will

334
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:54,980
never ever know what you can do. And so I pray tonight that you would speak to the

335
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:04,260
hearts of your people and plant in their hearts a desire, a thirst, to have

336
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:13,180
your power. Your power. Power to influence others for the gospel. Power to have

337
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:20,460
victory in their own hearts over sin. Power to see their children honor, love,

338
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:29,020
and serve you. Power, God, to read your Word and be able to communicate it. Power

339
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:41,380
in the midst of the most difficult times to be a testimony of joy. Lord, please put

340
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,780
in our hearts that desire. Wherever you are tonight, whether in this room or

341
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:54,140
listening to us by live stream, I pray that you understand that you're not

342
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:02,980
enough. I'm not enough. But with God, we can see great things that honor Him

343
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,340
accomplished through our lives. But it takes commitment. And my prayer for you

344
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,620
is at this moment, you will allow God and you will make the commitment to God, God

345
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:21,380
teach me to pray. Help me to be disciplined. Start disciplining your

346
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:27,620
prayer life. I'm sure a pastor could help you with perhaps helps to get that done.

347
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:36,380
But make the commitment tonight. Prayer will become real and vital in my life.

348
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,860
Let's stand together, our heads about, our eyes are closed.
