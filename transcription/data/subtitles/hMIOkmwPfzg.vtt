00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
This evening, Genesis chapter number 30,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:03.819
we'll begin in verse number 25

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.900
and really go all the way down through chapter 31

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.939
in verse number 16 as we continue our journey

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.420
through the book of Genesis

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.000
and studying in this particular section of the book

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.700
through the life of Jacob.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.299
And of course, in our previous two studies

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:20.459
through the book of Genesis,

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:23.340
we have learned of the sons of Jacob

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.459
as God has recorded for us 11 of those 12 sons

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:31.040
that are born here, that are mentioned, of course,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.840
in chapter number, the end of chapter number 29

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.599
and then in chapter number 30.

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:37.900
Of course, Benjamin the 12th son

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.360
is not recorded his birth until chapter number 35.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.880
We'll study the sons of Jacob

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.840
and of course mentioned many things

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.119
with regard to the events surrounding the birth

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.560
of these 12, 11 sons that are mentioned here

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.299
in this portion of scripture.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.919
And of course, I believe that we're able to learn

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.939
valuable lessons of the importance

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.860
of keeping our eyes on the Lord

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.959
and walking with him and not allowing others

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.480
to influence our walk with the Lord

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.940
and to avoid, of course, as we looked at the carnality

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.900
and the envy that was present

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.059
within the relationships of Rachel and Leah

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:17.940
and how we need to avoid those things

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.099
and seek to honor the Lord with our lives.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.660
And so we studied that portion of scripture.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.180
Now, as we lead into the end of chapter number 30

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:28.360
and really into the beginning of chapter number 31,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.639
we now find that the word of God is going to record for us

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.819
some of the events or circumstances, if you will,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.720
that lead to Jacob's return to Canaan.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.879
You'll remember that at the end of the conversation

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:47.279
between Jacob and his mom prior to leaving,

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.440
remember Rebecca said, and Terry with him a few days

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.720
in Genesis 27 and verse number 44,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.620
we've made note that those few days turned into years

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.220
and was a situation in which she had never really expected

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.059
that it would result in the way that it did.

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:07.540
But now we find that these circumstances that are recorded

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.020
are really going to lead back to that time

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.139
in which Jacob would return to Canaan.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.300
In fact, in verse number 25, he makes that known.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.580
It says this in verse 25 of Genesis 30,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.139
and it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.160
that Jacob said unto Laban,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.600
send me away that I may go unto mine own place

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.039
and to my country.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.320
And we find that that request is made.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.860
I want you to notice verse number 43.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.639
The word of God says that the man increased exceedingly

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.320
and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.360
and camels and asses.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.000
I've titled the message this evening

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.240
really from verse number 43 there,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.399
that Jacob increased exceedingly.

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.399
As we look at this passage of scripture again,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.740
we'll see some of the circumstances

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.699
that are surrounding his eventual return to Canaan.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.619
We know that he's in this place for a purpose

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:59.979
and for a time.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.619
In fact, we find that Jacob received that blessing

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.320
from his father Isaac in Genesis chapter number 28

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.699
with regard to leaving and going to Paddan Aram,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.059
and we find that that's exactly where he is.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.179
But notice as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:15.580
if you're taking notes, first of all,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.600
his interaction with Laban.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.539
We find that this interaction is recorded

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.720
in the portion of scripture.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.559
We've read about the, of course, marriage

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.639
in chapter number 29 of Jacob,

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.160
and then of course as the sons are born

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.639
and all of that is provided to us.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.559
And now we find that the text of scripture

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.279
focuses in on this interaction

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.759
that Jacob is going to have with Laban.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.979
It begins with a request.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.919
I've read verse 25 already,

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.059
and you find that at the end of verse number 25,

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.240
the request is given.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.220
It's really straightforward.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.440
It's a plain request.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.500
He says, send me a way that I may go

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.899
into my own place, into my country.

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.100
He says, give me my wives and my children

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.179
for whom I have served thee,

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.259
and let me go for thou knowest my service,

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.740
which I have done thee.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.179
And so the request is made.

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.539
It's a simple request.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.919
We find that Laban responds,

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.940
and in his responses, it's recorded to us

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.460
in verse number 27.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.500
We really find that Laban recognizes

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.539
the favor of God in the life of Jacob,

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.339
and even how it's impacted Laban's own life.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.799
Notice what he says, and Laban said unto him,

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.119
I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes,

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.000
tarry, and then notice what he says here

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.600
at the end of verse 27.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.559
For I have learned by experience

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.059
that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.399
In fact, Jacob would reiterate this

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.660
as he has this interaction.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.959
It says in verse 28, and he said,

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.079
appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.799
And he said unto him, thou knowest how I have served thee,

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.839
and how thy cattle was with me.

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:47.899
For it was little which thou hadst before I came,

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.980
and is now increased unto a multitude,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.059
and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming.

00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:00.019
And now, when shall I provide for mine own house also?

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.459
And so we find that this interaction

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.779
begins with a request of departure.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.880
It is followed up by this recognition of the favor,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.420
the blessing of God that's been upon Jacob,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.579
but that also has impacted Laban,

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.619
and he's recognized this blessing of God,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.200
and as we notice the interaction,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.160
we find that there's an agreement made

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.739
in the text of scripture.

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:23.600
Remember, there in verse number 28,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.359
that Laban said, appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.480
And we find that as you begin to look

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.959
through the passage of scripture,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.079
that there's an agreement that is made.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.720
In verse 31 through 34,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.480
the terms of the agreement are laid out to us.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480
It says, and he said, what shall I give thee?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.339
And Jacob said, thou shalt not give me anything.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.160
If thou wilt do this thing for me,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.059
I will again feed and keep thy flock.

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.019
I will pass through all thy flock today,

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.179
removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle,

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.140
and all the brown cattle among the sheep,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.059
and the spotted and speckled among the goats,

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.179
and of such shall be my hire.

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:59.899
So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come,

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:02.739
when it shall come for my hire before thy face.

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:05.660
Everyone that is not speckled and spotted among the goats,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.019
and brown among the sheep,

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:09.619
that shall be counted stolen with me.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.459
Notice what the Bible says in verse 34,

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:13.600
and Laban said, behold, I would,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.279
it might be according to thy word.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.519
There's an agreement that is made.

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:20.359
The terms of the agreement are spelled out.

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.040
We find that in the next several verses,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.179
the Bible talks about the removal of those cattle

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:27.600
and the livestock, and we begin to read about

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.559
the process of breeding in which Jacob employs,

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.540
and all that takes place,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.339
and it tells us in verse 35, that he removed that day,

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.200
that the he goats that were ring-streaked and spotted,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.399
and all the goats that were speckled and spotted,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.260
and everyone that had some white in it,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.380
and the brown among the sheep,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.700
and gave them into the hands of his sons.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.660
I'm not gonna continue to read all of the passage

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.940
of scripture here, but we find that there's some practice

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.119
that is used, that is employed by Jacob

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:55.839
with regard to the selective breeding,

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:59.899
and we see that he obviously had some knowledge from God

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:01.660
with regard to those things,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.339
but I want you to understand that as we look at

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.040
all of that process, that it really leads us

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.100
to our second thought this evening,

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.279
and that's not just the interaction with Laban,

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:13.600
but it's the increase from God,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.019
the increase from the Lord.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:18.760
We find that here as we get to verse number 43,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.880
the Bible says, and the man increased exceedingly,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.380
and had much cattle, and made servants,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.959
and men servants, and camels, and asses,

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.200
and I want you to see where the scriptures tell us

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.799
that his increase is from the Lord.

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:34.440
In fact, in chapter number 31,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.000
if you look down at verse number nine,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.500
in this particular verse, we find that Jacob here

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.700
is speaking to Rachel and Leah, and he says this,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.140
thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.980
and given them to me, and he's speaking specifically

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.980
about all of that breeding process,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.200
and all that was taking place in verse 36,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.980
down through verse number 42,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.260
and as we think about the increase from the Lord,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.299
we find really that this is fulfilled promise.

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:04.940
Go back, if you will, hold your place here,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.619
and go back to chapter 28.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.000
One thing that we can rejoice in

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.359
as we look at the word of God,

00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:10.640
and as we study the scriptures,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.160
and begin to examine the lives of those

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.399
that have gone before us,

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.600
and as we begin to think about our own lives,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.160
is that we have a book that God has given us

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.480
that is full of promises.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.480
When we think about the promises of God,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.160
and we understand that Peter says this,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.799
that they're exceeding great and precious promises,

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:33.400
and we sing songs such as Standing on the Promises,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.059
and we think about the promises of God,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.559
and the reality this evening is that we ought

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.919
to rejoice greatly for every promise

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.520
that God has given us.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.760
In fact, we find that the Bible says this

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.960
in 2 Corinthians 1, in verse number 20,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.000
for all the promises of God in him are yea,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and in him, amen, unto the glory of God by us.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:59.039
God's made some promises.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:02.200
Here, as we think about the life of Jacob in particular,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.039
and we see back in the 28th chapter,

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.380
as he would depart from his home,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.799
not knowing all that would befall him,

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.739
it's Isaac that speaks to him.

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:14.859
Notice in verse number one,

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:16.659
the Bible says that Isaac called Jacob,

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:19.020
and blessed him, and charged him,

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.039
and said unto him,

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:23.460
thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.260
Arise, go to Paddan Aram,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.419
and to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father,

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:30.539
and take thee a wife from thence

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:33.820
of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.880
And notice what he says in verses three and four.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.599
And God Almighty bless thee,

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.559
and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee,

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:44.840
that thou mayest be a multitude of people,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.640
and give thee the blessing of Abraham to thee,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.280
and to thy seed with thee,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.159
and that thou mayest inherit the land whereon thou art

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:56.080
a stranger which God gave unto Abraham.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.799
And at that moment, after those words,

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.320
the Bible says that Isaac,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.520
sent away Jacob, in verse number five.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.120
And as Jacob was sent away,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.480
it picks up and tells us in verse number 10

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.840
that Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.640
We've mentioned already in previous studies

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.960
that Paddan Aram is the chief city of Haran,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.340
and he's going to the place

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.520
where he's been instructed to do so.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.960
And it's during that journey

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.740
that he has that dream, that vision.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.380
And notice as you pick it up with me

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.800
in verse number 13 of Genesis 28,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.560
the Bible says that behold,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.080
the Lord stood above it and said.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.540
As you read verses 13 through 15,

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.440
I would say that you could summarize

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.360
these three verses of Scripture

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.180
by saying God has given Jacob some encouraging promises.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.720
God is speaking directly to Jacob

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.160
and He's giving him some very specific promises.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.240
It says, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.820
and the God of Isaac, the land whereon thou liest.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.460
To thee will I give it and to thy seed.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.620
Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.060
and thou shalt spread abroad to the west

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.200
and to the east and to the north and to the south.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.820
And in thee and in thy seed

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.580
shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.140
Notice, it's interesting because God is giving this promise

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.420
and He says the land whereon thou liest

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.180
in verse number 13, to thee will I give it

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.840
and to thy seed, but He's leaving that land, right?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.400
He's departing from that place

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.040
because He's fleeing because of the circumstances

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.040
of the stolen blessing and all that took place.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.640
And we find that God then says in verse number 15,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.240
and behold, I am with thee

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.880
and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.780
and will bring thee again into this land.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.880
For I will not leave thee until I have done that

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.580
which I have spoken to thee of.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.200
Now, those are some encouraging promises.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.520
Begin to think about Jacob.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.400
Of course, we know as we studied the 28th chapter

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400
and I won't rehash everything that I've recently said

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.680
just a few weeks ago in Genesis chapter 28,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.400
but this was a monumental event in the life of Jacob.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.640
His life was changed.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.200
We've likened this passage of Scripture

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.960
to when we were saved, when we were converted.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.060
And you think about the promises that God gives to Jacob

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.260
in this portion of Scripture.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.780
And then as we come to Genesis chapter number 30,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.700
and we find that the passage ends in verse number 43

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.540
by speaking about the increase.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.620
This man, it says, and the man increased exceedingly

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.600
and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.380
and camels and asses.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.780
And remember the Bible said there

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.700
that God was going to be with him.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.660
He was gonna keep him in all places

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.000
and bring thee again into this land

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.240
for I will not leave thee.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.880
Notice what he says, until I have done that

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.600
which I have spoken to thee of.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.880
God was working and God was doing.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.480
And we find that God is fulfilling his promises.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.300
Can I say this?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.540
God always fulfills his promises.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.000
You have promises that you hold dear

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.640
as we sing the song standing on his promises,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.600
as we take testimonies and we sing about

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.420
and testify about the promises of God,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.100
we hold dear to those promises.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.220
And we understand that God is faithful

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.180
and that God will honor his word.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.380
I'm so thankful as we look at the word of God

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.720
and consider the promises.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.140
Of course, there are some promises

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.800
that we look to in the word of God

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.900
that are promises that we would categorize

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.260
as being conditional promises.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.500
Often when we speak about conditional promises,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.720
we speak of promises that are oftentimes

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.080
the most common way that these promises are referred to

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.360
as if-then promise.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.200
If you do this, then God promises to do this.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.900
And when you think about those promises

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.080
and you consider that God has given us his very word,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.800
if you do these things,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.360
that God promises that he will do this.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.720
And I'm thankful for that

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.480
because God has given us the instruction

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.640
with regard to these promises.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.740
In fact, as you read Proverbs chapter number two,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.940
there's a whole list of them

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.619
in that very passage of scripture of if-then promises.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:30.140
But then as we come to the word of God,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.140
we find that not only do we come across

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.740
conditional promises,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.100
but we find that the word of God

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.020
contains unconditional promises.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.260
Promises that God has made that have no impact

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.300
on what we do or do not do with regard to those promises.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.300
Can I tell you that we sang about one of those this evening?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.960
Coming again, right?

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.800
Did not Jesus give us a promise

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.480
that he was going to return?

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.559
That promise stands as an unconditional promise.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:00.000
God himself has promised.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.399
He said, let not your hearts be troubled.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.480
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.320
In my father's house are many mansions.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.760
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.960
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.320
And he said this, if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.279
I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.779
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.220
We find that the word of God says that Jesus,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.980
as we would think about the truth

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.460
of the promise of his return,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.260
that there are some, according to 2 Peter 3,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.940
that mock that very promise

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.540
that we're speaking of this evening.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.339
And they say, where is the promise of his return?

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.940
And Peter responds and says,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.940
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.760
As some men count slackness.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.220
But his long-suffering to us word,

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.500
not willing that any should perish,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.140
but that all should come to repentance.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.899
Listen, God is not slack concerning any of his promises.

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:01.339
What he hath promised, he will do.

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:02.660
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.980
You know, he told us that his word

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.540
will not return unto him void,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.059
that it will accomplish what he has set forth

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:09.100
for it to accomplish.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.940
He's told us that we're to preach the word,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.580
to be instant in season, out of season,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.059
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:15.580
with all long-suffering and doctrine.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.420
Why?

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.839
Because God's promised to use his word.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.640
And as we take God at his word,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.720
and we take the promises that he's given us,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.200
and we claim those promises,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.880
we can rejoice this evening

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.480
that as we look at the increase from the Lord,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.520
as we look at what's taken place in the life of Jacob

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.720
over these years that he spent in this land,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.960
and we see how God has fulfilled these promises

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.420
that he's made to Jacob.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.720
As we evaluate our lives,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.540
is it not true that we can see

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.740
how God has been faithful to the promises

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.860
that he's given us?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.300
I'm thankful for that promise,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.059
and often as we take testimony specifically

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:57.660
with regard to promises from his word,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.899
we think of the promise of his presence.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.820
We often quote Hebrews 13 in verse number five,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.619
that portion of that verse of Scripture that says,

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.660
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.300
Isn't that precious?

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.960
We find that even in this text

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.600
that Jacob speaks about that very thing.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.839
As we think about the increase from the Lord,

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.960
we find that there are fulfilled promises.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.800
It tells us of much cattle, of maidservants,

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.600
of menservants, of camels and asses,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.200
but we find that due to this increase from the Lord,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880
due to these fulfilled promises,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.399
that we find that there's hostility that he faces.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.080
And we find that here,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.320
as we continue and move into the 31st chapter,

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:46.580
the Bible says that he heard the words of Laban's sons.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.020
Notice what these sons of Laban are saying.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.860
Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.820
and of that which was our father's,

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.020
hath he begotten all this glory.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.540
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.300
and behold, it was not toward him as before.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.899
We find that there's this open hostility, if you will,

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.920
we begin to see how Jacob is going to speak

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.440
with Rachel and Leah with regard to his plan,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.160
and really it goes back to where we started this evening

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.440
in verse number 25, when he says to Laban,

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.600
send me away, that I may go into mine own place,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.480
into my own country.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.160
He asks the question at the end of verse number 30,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.800
when shall I provide for my own house also?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.200
We find that as he would have this increase,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.799
as he would experience this blessing of the Lord,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.020
that there comes some opposition, if you will,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.979
there's some hostility that he faces.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:45.260
You know, the reality is that the enemy

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.020
is always seeking to oppose the child of God.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.960
The enemy is always seeking to oppose the child of God.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.380
You read through the scriptures,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.220
and you read of the men and women of God

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.100
who sought to do something for the Lord,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.500
for the cause of exalting and magnifying

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.080
the name of the Lord, there's opposition that they face.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.940
You think about the Apostle Paul when he speaks

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.119
about the open door that God has given,

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:14.239
but he says there are many adversaries.

00:19:14.239 --> 00:19:17.080
And we face opposition in this life,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.760
but we must understand and we must realize

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.960
that it's important for us to fix our attention

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.179
upon our Lord.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.720
See, if we put too much of our focus upon the opposition,

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.380
if we put too much of our attention and our focus

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.660
upon the adversary, then we become overwhelmed.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.520
We can become defeated.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.640
We understand that our enemy wants to,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.400
not only discourage us, our enemy wants to destroy us.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.359
And there are times in which he will use adversity.

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:50.280
There are times in which he will use

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.359
the opposition of others to devour us.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:58.640
We find here this evening that after Jacob

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.359
is aware of this hostility.

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:02.799
and after he hears the words,

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:05.239
and after he sees the countenance

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:07.439
in verse one and two of chapter 31,

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:10.039
I want you to see something just wonderful

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:12.359
because the Bible, the very next verse that we see,

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:15.999
the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Jacob.

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:19.039
I am thankful that when you hear the words

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.339
of the opposition, when you see the countenance

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:25.639
of the opposition, when you begin to face the hostility

00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:28.879
that Jacob was going to encounter and endure,

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:31.019
that God speaks to his man.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:34.359
You know, God uses his word.

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:39.779
Jacob did not have what we have in our hands this evening.

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:42.959
Genesis had not even been written yet,

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:47.319
for Moses was not yet on the scene, amen?

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:49.239
And the reality is that we have

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:51.919
the complete canon of Scripture,

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:54.319
and we go to this book and we begin

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:56.399
to open the pages of this book,

00:20:56.399 --> 00:20:59.479
and guess what, God speaks to us.

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:02.479
He begins to reveal to us promises

00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:04.159
and to remind us of promises,

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.279
and he gives us direction for our lives,

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:08.319
and when we face the opposition,

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:10.279
when we deal with the adversity,

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.579
oh, what a lesson for us to learn this evening

00:21:12.579 --> 00:21:15.199
how we must run to this book,

00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:17.719
and we must listen for the voice of God.

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:22.939
I've heard people say, God's just not speaking to me.

00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:24.779
How much are we reading of his word?

00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:27.659
Often, I found in my own life,

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:30.419
and I found in those lives of those

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:32.899
that have testified and I've interacted with,

00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:36.159
that oftentimes, the problem isn't with God speaking.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.819
The problem is with us as his servants hearing.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:41.619
Amen?

00:21:42.939 --> 00:21:46.259
Oftentimes, we're not hearing what God is saying.

00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:49.819
We're not listening for that still, small voice.

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:52.659
We're not following the admonition

00:21:52.659 --> 00:21:54.499
of the psalmist to be still

00:21:55.539 --> 00:21:58.099
and to know that he is God.

00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:00.259
And this evening, we find that in the midst

00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:01.839
of all that was taking place

00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:05.259
and all that was transpiring in the life of Jacob,

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:08.499
that the Lord speaks to Jacob.

00:22:08.499 --> 00:22:10.699
How precious that is.

00:22:10.699 --> 00:22:14.499
And it leads us to our third thought this evening,

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.619
the instruction from the Lord.

00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:18.979
I would simply say that the instruction

00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:20.499
is given in verse number three,

00:22:20.499 --> 00:22:22.699
and it's simple instruction,

00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:24.499
and it really follows with regard

00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:26.939
to the desire that he's already expressed

00:22:26.939 --> 00:22:29.379
as he spoke with Laban in verse 25.

00:22:29.379 --> 00:22:30.899
And now here in verse number three,

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:32.499
notice the word of God.

00:22:32.499 --> 00:22:35.439
It says, the Lord said unto Jacob,

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:38.339
return unto the land of thy fathers

00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:39.979
and to thy kindred,

00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:41.739
and I will be with thee.

00:22:41.739 --> 00:22:43.219
Return.

00:22:43.219 --> 00:22:45.139
The divine direction is given.

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:47.019
And it's interesting to me

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:49.199
that in the next several verses of Scripture,

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:50.939
really from verse four all the way down

00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:52.519
to verse number 13,

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:55.959
that Jacob is now speaking to Rachel and Leah.

00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:58.399
As Jacob is rehearsing the instruction

00:22:58.399 --> 00:23:00.159
that he's received from the Lord,

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.839
we find that as we dig in

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:05.959
and we begin to examine that which Jacob

00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:08.139
is communicating to Rachel and Leah

00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:11.239
within the context of this conversation,

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:14.739
we find that we are reminded of some precious truth,

00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:18.199
and really Jacob is reminding not only himself,

00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:20.759
but he's reminding Rachel and Leah of this truth.

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:24.079
Notice as it begins in verse number four,

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:26.599
and Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:29.079
to the field unto his flock and said unto them.

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:31.559
So again, as we look at these next verses

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:34.719
from verse number five here down through verse number 13,

00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:35.959
Jacob is rehearsing.

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:39.879
He's given the information to Rachel and Leah

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:41.079
that he has received,

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:42.439
and notice what he says.

00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:43.959
I see your father's countenance

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:46.759
that is not toward me as before.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:48.879
Notice this first thing that he says,

00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:52.799
but the God of my father hath been with me.

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:56.119
But the God of my father hath been with me.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.639
We find that as we think about

00:23:57.639 --> 00:24:00.519
the instruction that God has given,

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:03.779
and as we think about the way in which Jacob

00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:06.559
is now communicating these things to Rachel and Leah,

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:08.979
we've already seen the plan of God.

00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:10.799
Now we're seeing the presence of God.

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.779
We find that he testifies,

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:16.819
but the God of my father hath been with me.

00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:18.859
Listen, there might be some folks that oppose us.

00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:20.579
He says in the very text,

00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:22.179
I see your father's countenance

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:24.859
that it's not toward me as before,

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:26.739
but God's been with me.

00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:28.139
God's been with me.

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:30.639
Is that not what God promised?

00:24:30.639 --> 00:24:32.619
Remember back in chapter 28,

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:35.539
I don't want to just belabor the point,

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:39.659
but notice in chapter 28 that God said in verse number 15,

00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:41.659
behold, I am with thee.

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:48.439
What a precious promise of the Word of God.

00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:51.219
We rejoice when we read of those

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:52.339
that have gone before us

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:54.139
that have received this same promise.

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:55.099
Think about this.

00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:56.459
Turn to the book of Joshua, if you will,

00:24:56.459 --> 00:24:57.739
in the first chapter,

00:24:57.739 --> 00:25:01.739
and I want you to see how God encourages Joshua.

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:05.479
Moses is dead.

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:08.939
Joshua, the minister of Moses,

00:25:09.879 --> 00:25:11.799
is now receiving instruction

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:14.799
and God speaks to him very plainly in verse number two.

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:17.079
He says, Moses, my servant is dead.

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:19.039
Now therefore, arise.

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.239
Go over this Jordan,

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:21.919
thou and all the people unto the land,

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.000
which I do give to them,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.519
even the children of Israel.

00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:27.079
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon,

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:28.719
that have I given unto you,

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:30.599
as I said unto Moses.

00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:31.799
Notice in verse number five,

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:35.000
there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee.

00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:36.799
All the days of thy life.

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:37.759
Notice what he says,

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:39.879
as I was with Moses,

00:25:39.879 --> 00:25:42.199
so I will be with thee.

00:25:42.199 --> 00:25:43.779
I will not fail thee,

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:45.119
nor forsake thee.

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:47.919
It's on the heels of that promise

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:50.439
that God then says, be strong

00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:52.799
and have a good courage.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:55.679
Man, when we know that God is with us,

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.159
we can be strong and have that courage

00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:00.959
that God requires us to have

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:04.039
and gives us through that great promise.

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.159
Notice, if you will,

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.399
in the book of Jeremiah.

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:08.639
Turn to the book of Jeremiah

00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:11.679
and look in the first chapter of the book of Jeremiah.

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:14.039
Now you understand that Jeremiah

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.119
was called to minister to the nation of Judah

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:20.039
during a very dark time in her history.

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:22.359
A time in which they had forsaken the Lord.

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:23.839
The Bible tells us it's a time

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:25.759
in which they had forgotten the Lord.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:29.279
It's a time in which they followed idols.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:32.359
Jeremiah is to stand and to prophesy

00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:36.479
and to proclaim truth to this stiff-necked,

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:38.059
rebellious people.

00:26:39.159 --> 00:26:41.439
And as God calls Jeremiah,

00:26:41.439 --> 00:26:43.679
He says to him in verse number eight

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:45.399
of Jeremiah 1,

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:47.719
be not afraid of their faces.

00:26:47.719 --> 00:26:49.279
Why?

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.679
For I am with thee

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:53.759
to deliver thee,

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.000
saith the Lord.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.519
Man, I think that goes a long way

00:26:57.519 --> 00:27:00.759
for Jeremiah to stand

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:03.599
to proclaim the messages that he proclaimed,

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:06.000
to face the opposition that he faced,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.439
to be imprisoned as he was imprisoned

00:27:08.439 --> 00:27:09.679
and left for dead.

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:12.959
Even as the people got together

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:14.639
and they counseled among themselves

00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:16.119
that we're gonna kill Jeremiah.

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:18.319
There's no reason for him to live.

00:27:18.319 --> 00:27:21.279
He says, listen, you do with me what you want.

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:22.599
You're accountable to God.

00:27:24.479 --> 00:27:26.879
But he had this promise

00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:30.119
that God said, I'm with you.

00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.959
Turn to Matthew 28, if you will.

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:36.000
I mentioned already that we look at that promise

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.759
in Hebrews 13, and we should.

00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:41.639
I want you to think about this tonight

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:44.279
as we, yes, are looking here at the life of Jacob

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.079
and looking at as he rehearses these things

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:48.759
to Rachel and Leah,

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:51.919
but how we're reminded even in our own lives

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:54.000
how God's promised us some things.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.459
He's promised us His presence.

00:27:56.459 --> 00:27:58.559
Notice in Matthew 28,

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.559
we're familiar with the passage in verse 18.

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.599
Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:06.799
all powers given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.519
Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:10.159
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:11.919
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:13.479
teaching them to observe all things

00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:15.319
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:18.479
And then notice this, and lo,

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:21.079
I am with you always.

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:25.239
Even unto the end of the world.

00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:26.719
Amen.

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:29.159
He promises to go with us.

00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:32.199
He promises His presence.

00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:35.320
And as we learn the reality of His presence,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.799
as we learn the power of His presence,

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.079
it ought to encourage us this evening.

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:41.760
It ought to encourage us to know

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.479
that God says, I'm with you.

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:47.359
It's not just a promise that's reserved for Jacob

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.619
or for Joshua or for Jeremiah

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:52.000
or one of the other multiple people

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.459
that we could look to the word of God this evening,

00:28:54.459 --> 00:28:56.299
but it's a promise that's given to us

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.859
as the very people of God today.

00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:00.979
That God says, I'm with you.

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:01.979
I'm with you.

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:06.859
And as Jacob is rehearsing back in Genesis 31,

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.979
he says to Rachel and Leah,

00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:12.739
he says, listen, I know I can see

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:15.219
that your father's countenance, Laban,

00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:17.419
he's not favorable towards me.

00:29:17.419 --> 00:29:19.179
There's some hostility there,

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:23.260
but the God of my father hath been with me.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.339
What a joy.

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:27.820
It was at the end of verse number three

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.899
when God spoke specifically to Jacob.

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:35.940
He says at the end, and I will be with thee.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.179
And I will be with thee.

00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:40.419
He's not only rehearsing it

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:42.419
for the purpose of informing them,

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:44.539
but you know, when we rehearse the promises of God,

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:47.579
we're also reminding ourselves of those very promises.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:50.659
And it's good for us to remind ourselves

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:52.679
of the promises that God has given.

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:56.299
Notice as we continue, it says in verse six,

00:29:56.299 --> 00:29:58.019
and you know that with all my power,

00:29:58.019 --> 00:29:59.539
I have served your father.

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:02.799
My father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times,

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.419
but God suffered him not to hurt me."

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:08.919
Aren't you thankful that God's in control?

00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:10.759
God suffered him not to hurt me.

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:11.959
You know what that means?

00:30:11.959 --> 00:30:13.639
God didn't allow him to hurt him.

00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:17.099
God did not permit, He did not allow

00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:19.559
for Laban to hurt Jacob.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:23.399
Yes, he dealt with some adverse circumstances

00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:25.859
and changes of wages and so on and so forth,

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:27.939
but God was in control.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:31.679
Aren't you thankful this evening that God's in control?

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.759
Listen, there's nothing that can happen to you

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:37.099
that's outside of God's control.

00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:40.279
When Jeremiah was thrown into that pit,

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:42.899
God was still in control.

00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:44.939
When Daniel was thrown into that den of lions,

00:30:44.939 --> 00:30:47.579
God was still in control.

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.619
When Shadrach, Meshach, you get the point, right?

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:52.879
God's always in control.

00:30:52.879 --> 00:30:54.499
He continues and he says in verse 8,

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.799
if He said thus, the speckled shall be thy wages,

00:30:56.819 --> 00:30:58.239
all the cattle bear speckled.

00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:00.819
And if He said thus, the ring strake shall be thy hire,

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:03.739
then bear all the cattle ring strake.

00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:05.779
Again, we looked at verse 9 a moment ago.

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:07.939
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father

00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:08.939
and given them to me.

00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:11.579
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived

00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:13.799
that I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.579
and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle

00:31:15.579 --> 00:31:17.419
were ring strake speckled and gristled.

00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:20.679
And the angel of God spoken to me in a dream saying,

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:22.419
Jacob, and I said, here am I.

00:31:22.419 --> 00:31:24.019
And he said, lift up now thine eyes

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:26.179
and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle

00:31:26.219 --> 00:31:28.099
were ring strake speckled and gristled.

00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:31.139
For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:32.359
Pause there just for a moment.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:35.939
Aren't you thankful that God's aware of what we face?

00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:41.379
God says to Jacob, which says in verse 11,

00:31:41.379 --> 00:31:43.819
that the angel of God spoken to me in a dream

00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:46.279
and what the angel of the Lord said to Jacob

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.619
at the end of the verse is that God says,

00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:53.619
I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:55.139
You know, sometimes in life,

00:31:55.139 --> 00:31:58.259
we get this kind of approach to life

00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:01.279
and this perspective that no one understands.

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:04.619
No one sees what I'm dealing with.

00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:08.539
No one understands the difficulty that I'm facing.

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:13.219
Can I encourage you this evening that God sees,

00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:18.219
that God knows, that God is aware of what we're dealing with?

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:22.419
And can I encourage you this evening

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:26.219
that I'm more encouraged by knowing that God knows

00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:27.319
than if you know?

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:34.459
Sometimes as human beings, we'd rather each other know

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:35.979
so that we can get some pity,

00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:39.779
so that we can get some whatever we need to get,

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:44.259
but really we find great refuge and great comfort

00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:46.219
in knowing that God is aware.

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.419
Because when God is aware,

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:54.419
He can do more than all of you can do collectively, right?

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:58.339
Think about the children of Israel in the book of Exodus.

00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:00.719
He heard their crying.

00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:04.179
He knew that there was a new Pharaoh that rose up.

00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:07.779
He knew what they were dealing with and He was aware.

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:11.699
And as God comes and He appears and He speaks to Moses,

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:12.859
you know what He says to them?

00:33:12.859 --> 00:33:15.459
I've seen their affliction.

00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:18.019
God knew about it.

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:19.859
He was aware of it.

00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:22.219
Well, then why didn't you step in and stop it?

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:25.339
Because He has a plan.

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:29.179
And as I've often said from this pulpit,

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:31.239
and I think it was adequately said this morning

00:33:31.239 --> 00:33:32.979
from this pulpit,

00:33:32.979 --> 00:33:37.019
there are times in which God will take us through a storm

00:33:37.019 --> 00:33:40.739
instead of delivering us from a storm.

00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:42.439
And as He takes us through the storm,

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:43.279
you know what He's doing?

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:45.579
He's delivering us through that storm.

00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:47.779
And as we're delivered through that storm,

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:50.259
we come out on the other side knowing more about God

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:52.459
than we ever would have known about God.

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:56.259
And God says to Jacob,

00:33:56.259 --> 00:33:59.279
I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:02.499
Sometimes we can just sit around and say,

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.499
nobody understands.

00:34:04.499 --> 00:34:06.179
Nobody knows.

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:09.179
Can I encourage you tonight that God knows?

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.339
God knows.

00:34:11.259 --> 00:34:14.099
That should encourage our hearts tonight.

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:16.099
That should comfort us.

00:34:16.099 --> 00:34:19.139
Verse 13, I am the God of Bethel,

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.019
where thou anointest the pillar.

00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:23.339
He's talking back about chapter 28.

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:26.579
We've looked at that multiple times already this evening,

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:28.559
and He's really looking at verses,

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:29.999
the latter part of the text,

00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:31.979
looking at verses 18 and 19.

00:34:31.979 --> 00:34:33.659
But notice what He says,

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.219
in where thou vowest a vow unto me.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.379
Now arise, get thee out from this land

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:42.699
and return unto the land of thy kindred.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.579
We find that we've been encouraged

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.219
as we've looked at this instruction,

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:49.819
as Jacob is rehearsing these things to Rachel and Leah,

00:34:49.819 --> 00:34:52.219
we've been reminded of God's plan.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.779
I'm thankful that God always has a plan.

00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:58.539
Sometimes we just gotta figure out what God's plan is.

00:34:59.859 --> 00:35:01.979
Sometimes we don't really see all of it,

00:35:01.979 --> 00:35:02.859
we don't know,

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:05.199
and God's not given us all the blueprint,

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.419
if you will, up front.

00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:08.579
He just, sometimes He just calls us

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:10.459
to follow Him step by step.

00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:13.419
Day by day, we sang the song Not Long Ago,

00:35:13.419 --> 00:35:16.979
and you think about how as we walk with God,

00:35:16.979 --> 00:35:19.019
it's a day by day journey,

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:21.999
and He's revealing His plan one step at a time.

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:26.539
I'm thankful that God did not give me

00:35:26.539 --> 00:35:28.659
all of the grace in one day

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.779
that I would need for all of my Christian journey,

00:35:30.779 --> 00:35:33.699
but He gives me the grace that I need day by day.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:36.539
Day by day.

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:38.939
His grace and His mercy

00:35:38.939 --> 00:35:41.859
for the plan that He has for my life.

00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:43.819
We've seen about His presence,

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:46.579
we've understood this evening,

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:48.199
as we've looked at this passage,

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:49.779
that God is in control.

00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:53.579
Laban could not do anything to Jacob

00:35:54.699 --> 00:35:56.579
that God did not permit him to do,

00:35:56.579 --> 00:35:57.899
and then God is aware.

00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:01.339
Aren't those some encouraging realities?

00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:04.219
But these are not realities just for Jacob,

00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:06.619
they're realities for us as well.

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:08.619
And we think about the passage of Scripture,

00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:12.019
and we think about this rehearsing of Jacob

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:12.899
to Rachel and Leah.

00:36:12.899 --> 00:36:15.299
I want you to see that now Rachel and Leah

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:17.739
in the latter part of what we're studying this evening

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:18.999
in verses 14 through 16,

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:21.099
there's a response here from them.

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:21.979
It says in verse 14,

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:24.199
"'And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him,

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:26.519
"'Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:28.239
"'in our father's house?

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.479
"'Are we not counted of him strangers?

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:33.039
"'For he hath sold us and hath quite devoured

00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:35.159
"'also our money.

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.919
"'For all the riches which God hath taken from our father,

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:39.959
"'that is ours and our children's.'"

00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:40.799
But then notice what it says,

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:45.599
"'Now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.'"

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.879
I like the last part of the verse

00:36:48.879 --> 00:36:51.519
because really in verses 14 through 16,

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:53.999
as Rachel and Leah are responding,

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:55.639
they're sharing some things,

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:57.739
they're sharing their perspective,

00:36:57.739 --> 00:37:00.199
but we find that at the end of their comment,

00:37:00.199 --> 00:37:05.199
they say, "'Now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.'"

00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:08.119
Let me say this tonight,

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:11.259
as we think about that statement from Rachel and Leah,

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:14.059
let me say it from two perspectives.

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:15.039
Number one is this,

00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:17.839
when we know what God's told us to do, we better do it.

00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:19.759
Amen?

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:23.759
When we know what God has told us to do, we better do it.

00:37:23.759 --> 00:37:25.539
We better be obedient to God.

00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:28.239
But let me say this also,

00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:33.519
when we can adequately communicate to someone else

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:35.639
what God has instructed us to do,

00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:39.479
we have the ability of convincing them

00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:43.939
that we are convinced ourselves of what God wants us to do

00:37:43.939 --> 00:37:45.939
and we can garner their support.

00:37:47.279 --> 00:37:49.919
Because here, listen, if Jacob says,

00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:51.299
"'Well, you know, I'm not really sure

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:53.159
"'and it's kind of this wishy-washy approach

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:54.819
"'and like, you know, what should we do?

00:37:54.819 --> 00:37:55.879
"'Let's get out some paper

00:37:55.879 --> 00:37:57.299
"'and write down all the pros over here

00:37:57.299 --> 00:37:58.459
"'and all the cons over here

00:37:58.459 --> 00:38:00.959
"'and we're just really gonna kind of put out a fleece

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:02.679
"'and so on and so forth.'"

00:38:02.679 --> 00:38:05.479
No, no, Jacob is communicating to Rachel and Leah

00:38:05.479 --> 00:38:08.919
what God has told him to do.

00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:13.699
God said, arise and return.

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:19.559
And when he was so convinced of what God's plan was

00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:23.119
and he was able to effectively communicate,

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.239
here's what God has instructed me to do,

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:27.559
there's this response,

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:31.719
"'Whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.'"

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:33.440
And I like that.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.559
Because the reality is that

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:37.320
if God's told you to do something,

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.919
if God's told me to do something,

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:40.279
we better obey God.

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:47.279
We think about decisions that we make in our lives.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:51.880
Times have gone in the past where people will come

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.399
and seek to counsel with me.

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:57.279
It's not just me, but obviously,

00:38:57.279 --> 00:39:00.059
people have counseled with pastors over the years.

00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:03.459
And there are times in which I have said,

00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:05.259
and I know others have as well

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:08.299
through conversation that I've had with them,

00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:10.139
something like this.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:12.859
If that's what God's told you to do,

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:13.959
then you better do it.

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:16.779
Why?

00:39:16.779 --> 00:39:19.179
Because I'm not trying to get in the way of God.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.019
Amen?

00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:26.380
And when God gives us that clarity,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.659
when God reveals to us His plan

00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:31.579
and He communicates with us,

00:39:31.579 --> 00:39:35.459
and then we're able to communicate that plan

00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:37.619
that God has for our lives to others,

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:39.059
we can garner their support.

00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:42.500
I think about Brother Baloo this morning.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.779
Do you have any doubt in your mind

00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:45.579
that God's called him to Idaho?

00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:50.419
No doubt in my mind whatsoever.

00:39:51.899 --> 00:39:54.699
I mean, if he got up here and was presenting his ministry

00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:55.539
and just kind of like,

00:39:55.539 --> 00:39:58.179
well, you know, I'm just kind of gonna try it out

00:39:58.179 --> 00:39:59.299
and see this and that,

00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:05.179
know, I'm kind of keeping my, I'm not, I'm not sure that God's clearly communicated

00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:08.499
to you because you're obviously not able to clearly communicate to us what God's called

00:40:08.499 --> 00:40:16.399
you to do. But Jacob is able to stand and rehearse. And it's because in that time of

00:40:16.399 --> 00:40:21.539
difficulty and that time of adversity after the Bible speaks about his increasing greatly

00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:28.979
that the Lord spoke to him. I hope this evening that we'd hold tight to the promises of God.

00:40:28.979 --> 00:40:34.019
I hope this evening that we would understand the reality of His presence and that we would

00:40:34.019 --> 00:40:40.179
be encouraged and comforted through the truth of His presence, that God does have a plan,

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:46.239
that He is aware of your circumstance, of your situation, and that everything that we

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:57.859
encounter in life, God's in control. There are times in which we say, it's all falling

00:40:57.859 --> 00:41:07.419
apart. How in the world? God's in control. God has a purpose. God has a plan. And He

00:41:07.419 --> 00:41:13.379
delivers us through and He strengthens us. And there are times as we look at the truth

00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:22.259
of 2 Corinthians 1 that we are comforted by the God of all comfort so that we then can

00:41:22.259 --> 00:41:28.979
comfort others with the same comfort that we have received. And that's a great truth

00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:35.239
of ministry within the household of faith. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank

00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:42.579
You for loving us. We thank You for this passage of Scripture. And as we overview these circumstances,

00:41:42.579 --> 00:41:52.419
these events that lead to the departure of Jacob from that land to go back to Canaan,

00:41:52.419 --> 00:41:58.919
it's more than just historical fact that is provided. There is precious truth that You've

00:41:58.919 --> 00:42:04.319
revealed that encourages even us this evening. I'm thankful that as we've looked at these

00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:11.479
promises and these realities in the life of Jacob that we can understand that these truths

00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:18.219
are applicable in our lives as well. I pray that You'd help us to rest in Thee. Lord,

00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:32.439
help us to listen for the voice of God through Your precious book that You would reveal to

00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:49.539
us Your plan. That we'd say, even as Samuel of old said, speak Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:56.999
The idea of that word is to hear with the intent of obedience. God, I pray that You'd

00:42:56.999 --> 00:43:01.799
encourage Your people this evening through this passage of Scripture as we've highlighted

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:09.879
some of these wonderful promises. We claim them for our own. We'd go out with renewed vision and

00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:18.679
passion to serve You, to make a difference in this lost and dying world. We commit these moments to

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:22.359
You and ask that You'd move and work as only You can. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
