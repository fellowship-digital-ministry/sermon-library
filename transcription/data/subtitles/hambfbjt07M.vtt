00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
This morning Matthew 28 verses 1 through 10 and you can turn there

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.640
I want to read a passage to you from the book of Revelation and Revelation chapter number one

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.880
I just want to worship the Lord here this morning and thank him for who he is

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.780
He's such a wonderful God a wonderful Savior and in Revelation chapter number one

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.399
We'll get to Matthew here in just a moment

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.719
But Revelation chapter number one in verse number four, it says John to the seven churches, which are in Asia

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.840
Grace be unto you in peace from him

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.439
which is and which was and which is to come and

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:38.639
From the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.400
Who is the faithful witness in the first begotten of the dead?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.919
and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.319
washed us from our sins in his own blood and

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:56.880
And it made us kings and priests and the God and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.240
Amen

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.540
Behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.480
They also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen verse 8

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.360
I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:20.720
The Almighty skip down to verse number 11

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
He says again

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.000
I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.879
Which are in Asia? He lists the churches notice in verse 17 and when I saw him I

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.559
fell at his feet as dead and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.120
He laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.440
I am he that liveth and was dead and behold. I am alive

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.800
forevermore

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.239
Amen and have the keys of hell and of death

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.959
We serve a risen Savior. He is the Lord God Almighty. He reigns he rules

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.919
He sees the storm from the other side why because he's Alpha and Omega

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.020
there are times in which even as that song speaks of we need to remember the word of God and the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.139
Miracles contained therein and the power of God's spoken word. We find the power of his written word

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.979
We're so thankful that he is the Lord God omnipotent there in Matthew 28

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.940
The text for us this morning. It's a familiar passage of Scripture, but we find that as we look at these verses

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.820
I hope that once again it would stir you up that it would bring in your heart a

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:44.259
Level of hope and courage and strength as we're reminded again of the truth that we serve a risen Savior

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.419
I love the songs that we sang today. What a joy

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.419
To sing about our Savior living in every day of our lives

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.779
We ought to be mindful of the fact that we serve a risen Savior

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.539
The glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of our faith

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:07.080
We understand that we believe that we understand that we meet every week on Sunday

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.940
Why because we serve a risen Savior and on this special day in our calendar each year. We've set aside

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:20.460
To commemorate that truth, but really every single week in every day of our lives

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:25.220
we ought to rejoice in the truth that we serve a risen Savior and

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:31.539
We find here that as we gather and we celebrate this day in this truth

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:37.580
We understand that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that he suffered a a horrible death

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.020
But he was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose in victory

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.460
We understand even as I prayed this morning that he conquered sin death and the grave

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.220
What a blessing that is the Lord God omnipotent. He is

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.460
Victorious

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.380
the Apostle Paul said it this way is he's writing to the church in Corinth in first Corinthians 15 and he's speaking to them about

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.380
the cornerstone of our faith and

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.899
Understanding this great truth. He says to them in verse number 12 of that chapter

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.940
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.260
How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead, but if there be no resurrection of the dead

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.100
Then is Christ not risen and if Christ be not risen

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.220
Then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.119
Yay, and we are found false witnesses of God

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.179
Because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.260
Whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:49.140
For if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.899
Ye are yet in your sins

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.820
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.739
We're of all men most miserable notice verse 20

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:07.940
But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:15.899
That sleep for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in Adam all die

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:18.339
even so in Christ

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.540
Shall all be made alive

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:24.820
But every man in his own order notice verse 23 Christ the firstfruits

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.339
Afterward they that are Christ at his coming. I'm so thankful for the truth of

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.980
The resurrection I'm saying I'm thankful this morning that as we meditate and consider this truth

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.299
That is before us and again should be before us on a daily basis that it brings

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:48.220
Joy in my heart that it should cause us as the people of God to be

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:54.660
Strengthened to have hope to have courage to understand that we serve a risen Savior

00:05:54.739 --> 00:06:02.100
He conquered sin death in the grave. No, we're not left in our sins. No, we're not of all men most miserable

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.179
No, we have hope and we have courage and we have faith and confidence why because he lives and what a joy that is

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:15.700
This morning in Matthew 28, I want to preach a message that I've simply entitled he is risen

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.980
He is risen

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.140
The Bible says in verse number one in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.820
Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.339
It says this behold

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:34.059
there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.459
Sat upon it

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:41.380
His countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.619
The keepers did shake and became as dead men the angel answered and said unto the women

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.260
Fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.899
He is not here

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.619
For he is risen as he said

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.019
Come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.459
Behold he goeth before you into Galilee there. Shall you see him?

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:15.540
Lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulcher

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.140
Which with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.019
Behold Jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.779
Then said Jesus unto them be not afraid

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:38.260
Go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:44.380
Shall they see me as we look at this passage of Scripture and I preach this message. He is risen

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.540
I want you to notice first of all the interaction with the angel

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:54.019
We understand that chapter number 27 of the book of Matthew provides us with a record of the trial the scourging the

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:58.339
Crucifixion the death and the burial of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:06.899
The chapter concludes chapter 27 concludes by telling us that they made the sepulcher as sure

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:11.619
As they could in fact there in verse number 65 of chapter 27

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:17.940
Pilate said unto them see they came let me read what they say in verse number 63. It says saying sir

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:25.380
We remember that that deceiver said that's how they referred to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.179
He is the way the truth and the life

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:33.140
He's never deceived anyone, but they call him a deceiver. And here's what they say

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.219
While he was yet alive after three days, I will rise again

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.219
He did say that by the way

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.140
Because he knew that that's exactly what he was going to do. Remember in John chapter 10

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.460
He said that he's the Good Shepherd and the Good Shepherd

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.299
He lays down his life for the sheep, but that he would bring it up again and he had power to do

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:59.700
So we find here in verse number 64 that these that came to Pilate they say these are the chief priests and Pharisees by the way

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.059
Religious but lost the Bible says in verse number 64 command. Therefore that the sepulcher be made sure

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.700
Until the third day

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.299
Lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:18.780
So the last error shall be worse than the first by the way

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.179
The disciples didn't have to come and interact in any way shape or form

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.340
He himself would conquer the grave. He would conquer death

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.539
It says in verse number 65 that Pilate says to these religious leaders. You have a watch go your way

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:36.859
Make it as sure as ye

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.940
can

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.380
So they went and made the sepulcher sure

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:46.059
sealing the stone and

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.340
setting a watch

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.739
but yet

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.539
The Bible tells us as we get into chapter number 28

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:59.340
We begin to read this passage of scripture and we read how that Mary Magdalene and the other Mary that they're going

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.380
they're

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.580
to the sepulchre, and as they're going,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.720
the Bible tells us that there was a great earthquake

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.800
in verse number two,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.020
and the angel of the Lord descended from heaven

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.720
and came and rolled back the stone

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.800
from the door and sat upon it.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.380
If you read the other Gospel accounts,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.440
you find that as Mary Magdalene and Mary are walking

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.600
as they're on their way there to the tomb,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.460
that they actually have conversation

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.320
with regard to how they would move the stone.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.160
They had a certain expectation.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.760
The Bible tells us, if you read the sister passages,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.680
how they went with those ointments to go

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.520
and to deal with those things,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.900
and we find that as they arrive,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.680
that they see this angel,

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.720
and there's an interaction that takes place

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.040
between Mary Magdalene, the other Mary,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.920
as she's referred to here, and the angel.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.760
Notice in verse number three,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.280
the Bible describes this angel as one

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.220
that says his countenance was like lightning,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.800
as raiment white as snow,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.500
and for fear of him, the keepers did shake

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.580
and became as dead men.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.620
By the way, those are the ones that are mentioned

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.880
in verse number 66, that were gonna make it

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.200
as sure as they could, that were gonna secure the tomb,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.080
that no one would be able to get in,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.080
that no way would it be that Jesus would rise from the dead.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.560
In fact, those same keepers are mentioned

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.040
in verses 11 through 15.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.360
We won't take time today to deal with that passage

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.520
of Scripture in detail, but you will find

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.120
that as you read that passage,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.040
that these keepers of the tomb,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.200
that they were offered large sums of money.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.200
They were given a large money to these soldiers

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.760
so that they would say that they would make up a story

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.600
that the disciples came by night

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.780
and stole them away while we slept.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.220
By the way, if you know anything about this time,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.240
this era in history, if you were a soldier

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.620
and you were found asleep on your watch,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.280
you were put to death.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.260
But these guys made up a story.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.000
By the way, it was the religious leaders

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.880
that called our Savior a deceiver,

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.760
yet they were the ones that came up with a deceptive story

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.240
with regard to the resurrected Christ.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.080
We find that here, that it says that now

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.360
there's this interaction in verse number five.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.760
It says, and the angel answered and said unto the women,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.880
notice as there's this interaction between the angel

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.040
and these two Marys, the Bible says that this angel

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.639
gives them an announcement, makes this announcement.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:28.260
Notice it begins, fear not ye.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.419
Fear not.

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:33.820
It's interesting that Jesus says to them

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.740
in verse number 10 as He meets them,

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.460
and we'll get to that in just a moment,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.020
be not afraid.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.220
See, when they departed, they departed with fear

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.580
and great joy.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.540
But here, the angel begins the announcement,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.260
this interaction as it's recorded,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.720
the announcement begins by saying, fear not ye.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.720
Notice how it continues, for I know that ye seek Jesus,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.160
which was crucified.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.320
He was crucified.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.760
He hung upon that cruel cross to pay for your sin

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.880
and to pay for my sin.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.080
He shed His precious blood on the cross of Calvary.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.680
We find that He says there in verse number 46

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.559
as it's recorded in Matthew's account,

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:19.680
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.340
That is to say, my God, my God,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.260
why hast thou forsaken me?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.580
And the sin of mankind was poured upon Him.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.260
You remember our text of Scripture from last week

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.620
in 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.900
where we spoke about the importance of be ye reconciled,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.779
where the Bible says in verse number 21

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:39.540
that He, speaking of God the Father,

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.139
hath made Him, speaking of God the Son,

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:44.620
Jesus Christ, to be sin for us,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.020
who knew no sin, that we might be made

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.020
the righteousness of God in Him.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.120
And we find that the Bible records for us

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.320
if we were to look at the account there

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.840
in the book of John, where He says,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.080
it is finished.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.279
Remember, Pilate was so amazed that he was dead already,

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.919
they came to the other two that were crucified

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:07.880
on that same day, and they broke the legs of those men

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.680
so that they would die, but when they came to Jesus,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.880
they found that He was dead already.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.720
Why?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.160
Because He gave up the ghost.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.119
By the way, it was a fulfillment of prophecy

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.980
and the Old Testament says that not one of His bones

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.820
would be broken, and though He suffered a horrific death,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.260
they did not break His legs.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.100
Why?

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.779
For He was dead already and He paid that price.

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:30.339
Notice what the angel says.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:35.339
I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.739
Notice, verse number six, He is not here.

00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:42.300
Isn't that exciting?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.700
He is not here.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.540
Why?

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.300
For He is risen.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.880
Oh, hallelujah.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.200
He is risen indeed.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.360
We find that that's the statement

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.239
that the disciples on the road to Emmaus

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:59.320
in Luke chapter number 24, as it's recorded there,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.839
as Jesus met them as they were returning home

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.480
and they were down, they're countenance was sad,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.700
the Bible tells us, and Jesus came alongside of them

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.160
and He began to speak to them

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.520
and He expounded all things unto them concerning Himself

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.959
from Moses and the prophets,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.420
and we find that after they were there to break bread

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.140
that He prayed and then He disappeared

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.420
and they said that their heart did burn within them,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.739
they turned around and walked almost seven miles

00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:28.260
back to Jerusalem to deliver a message

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.020
to the other disciples, and that message was this,

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.580
for Christ is risen indeed.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.660
And here, the angel in this interaction

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.820
with Mary Magdalene and the other Mary,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.020
he says, I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.839
He is not here, why?

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.279
For He is risen.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:52.279
Notice this, as He said, as He said.

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.239
We're gonna look at several passages in the book of Matthew

00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:59.399
to see where the Lord Jesus Christ had given this truth

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.200
with regard to His resurrection.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200
Let me just reference,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.839
before we get to the passages in Matthew,

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.839
let me reference and just read for you

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.760
what Jesus said in the beginning of His ministry

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.480
in John chapter number two, in verse number 19,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.420
Jesus answered and said unto them,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.420
destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.980
Then said the Jews, 40 and six years

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.500
was this temple in building,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.260
and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.619
But He spake of the temple of His body.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.239
When therefore He was risen from the dead,

00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:35.980
His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.179
and they believed the scripture

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:41.480
and the word which Jesus had said.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.760
Now notice, back in our passage in the book of Matthew,

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.920
that the angel says He's not here for He is risen,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.040
as He said.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.839
Many years ago I preached a message just on that phrase,

00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:56.119
as He said, from this passage of scripture

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:58.959
and I dealt with the fact that Jesus always does

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.179
what He says He will do.

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:01.720
And I went through a series of things,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.200
I'm not gonna do that this morning,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.000
of things that He said that have come to pass

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.140
and things that He has said that have not yet come to pass

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.020
but we have the confidence and the faith

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.700
knowing that He always does what He says He will do

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.899
and how we can rejoice in that.

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:19.739
Notice here He says, the angel,

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:22.500
He says He is not here, He is risen, as He said.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.339
Turn back a few pages to Matthew chapter number 16.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.500
Matthew chapter number 16

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.360
is a wonderful passage of scripture,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.339
one in which I love going to

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:33.779
and reading the passage of scripture.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.239
There's a great truth, many great truths in this passage.

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:39.600
One wonderful promise that we often quote

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.959
and that is when Jesus said, I will build my church

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:46.760
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.360
Contextually within that wonderful promise,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.640
it was when Jesus came to His disciples

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320
and He asked this question.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.320
He says, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.880
What a great question.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.360
Who do people say that I am?

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:05.820
They answered and said, some say that thou art John the Baptist

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.420
and some say that you're Elijah or Jeremiah

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.580
or one of the prophets.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.860
We find that as this question is asked

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.739
and He receives the response from the disciples

00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:21.059
as to whom men say that He is,

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:24.779
then Jesus turns directly to them and says to them,

00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:28.820
but whom say ye that I am?

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.040
Peter.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.840
He stands up with boldness and confidence

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.960
and He says, thou art the Christ,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.679
the Son of the living God.

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:43.559
Oh, what a powerful declaration of Peter.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:47.479
And we find that Peter receives the response from Jesus

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:50.679
when he says, blessed art thou, Simon Barjona,

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:53.599
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.200
but my Father which is in heaven.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.619
And what a joy to understand that thou art the Christ,

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:00.940
the Son of the living God.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.520
I'd ask you this morning, who do you say that Jesus is?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.780
Oh, we could go through our society today

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.739
and we could ask many people,

00:19:10.739 --> 00:19:13.500
who do you say that Jesus is?

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.799
Oh, you'd have some that would say He was a good man,

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:18.900
He was a prophet, He was fill in the blank.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.940
I mean, all sorts of ideas,

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.380
even within cults and false teachings

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.479
that they have this idea of who Jesus is,

00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:30.359
but we find that Jesus is the Christ,

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:32.440
He is the anointed one, He is Messiah,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.700
He is God in flesh.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.000
There's the Father that makes that known to us

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.880
as we find here in this passage of Scripture.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.479
But I want you to notice

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:45.640
that after Jesus has this interaction

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.960
and He gets the question again,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.080
who is Jesus to you?

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.520
I hope that you understand this morning that He is God.

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.220
That He died for you.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.739
That He was buried in a borrowed tomb

00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:59.739
and He rose in victory even as we celebrate today

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:01.739
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:03.619
He is the Savior of the world,

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.619
but He wants to be your Savior personally

00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:07.779
if you accept Him as your personal Savior.

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:11.039
Understanding that your sin has a penalty.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.319
That penalty is death.

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:14.779
Separation from God and the lake of fire forever.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:17.319
Oh, how terrible that is.

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.659
But Jesus made a way. Why?

00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:20.819
Because He is the way.

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:23.239
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:26.779
And He made the way for you to be reconciled to God

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:28.859
even as I preached last Sunday.

00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:29.979
Be reconciled to God.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.179
Oh, if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:33.639
as your personal Savior today,

00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:35.899
if you do not have that 100% assurance

00:20:35.899 --> 00:20:37.219
that heaven is your home,

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:39.939
would you trust Christ today?

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:41.899
Would you understand who He is?

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:43.419
Oh, He's not just a prophet.

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:45.099
He's not just a good man.

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:46.619
He's God.

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:47.699
What a joy that is.

00:20:47.699 --> 00:20:51.059
But notice in v. 21 of Matthew 16,

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:53.999
it says from that time forth

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:57.299
began Jesus to show unto His disciples

00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:59.759
how that He must go unto Jerusalem

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:01.539
and suffer many things of the elders

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:03.139
and chief priests and stribes,

00:21:03.139 --> 00:21:04.399
notice this,

00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:08.599
and be killed and be raised again

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:09.859
the third day.

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:11.399
What was that message of the angel

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:12.799
during that interaction

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:15.119
with Mary Magdalene and the other Marys?

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:16.699
They had this interaction.

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:17.859
He says, fear not ye,

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:19.979
for I know that you seek Jesus

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:21.199
which was crucified,

00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:22.479
for He is not here,

00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:25.319
for He is risen as He said.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:27.439
Here in Matthew 16 is when He began.

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:29.259
It says from that time forth

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:32.039
began Jesus to show unto His disciples

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:33.279
all of these things

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:35.979
and how that He would be killed

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:38.159
and that He'd be raised again the third day.

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:41.999
Notice in v. 22-23,

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:44.399
it says, and while they abode in Galilee,

00:21:44.399 --> 00:21:45.699
Jesus said unto them,

00:21:45.699 --> 00:21:47.319
the Son of Man shall be betrayed

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:48.659
into the hands of men,

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:50.159
and they shall kill Him,

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:54.499
and the third day He shall be raised again.

00:21:54.499 --> 00:21:56.199
And they were exceeding sorry.

00:21:56.199 --> 00:21:57.559
You can understand their emotion

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:58.759
with regard to the fact

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:00.579
that they now have walked with Jesus

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:01.959
for a lengthy period of time

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:05.139
during His earthly ministry.

00:22:05.139 --> 00:22:07.059
And this caused sorrow.

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.259
You can look at the sister passage

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:11.299
over in John 13

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:12.699
and understand how Jesus

00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:15.059
was revealing these things to His disciples.

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:16.539
And it was there in chapter 14

00:22:16.539 --> 00:22:18.839
when He says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.479
They were saddened by that

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:21.579
which they had heard,

00:22:21.579 --> 00:22:24.359
but we understand that this is the plan of God.

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:25.639
Throughout the book of John,

00:22:25.659 --> 00:22:28.759
we read this reference with regard to the hour.

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:30.659
Jesus says in John 2,

00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:33.499
the first miracle there at Cana,

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:34.659
the marriage,

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:37.699
He says, mine hour is not yet come.

00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:39.579
And you find throughout the book of John

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:41.219
that there are several references

00:22:41.219 --> 00:22:43.519
to this phrase that Jesus would use

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:44.979
concerning the hour.

00:22:44.979 --> 00:22:46.859
We get to John 17,

00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:49.459
and He says the hour is come.

00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:50.739
It was time.

00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:54.079
See, Jesus understood the plan of redemption.

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:56.819
And we sing often this song.

00:22:56.819 --> 00:23:00.059
He was born to die.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.719
Why? So that man could be reconciled.

00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:05.859
So that we could be redeemed.

00:23:05.859 --> 00:23:07.859
Jesus was showing His disciples.

00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:09.579
He was teaching His disciples

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:11.019
that yes, He would be killed,

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:12.899
but that He would be raised again

00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:13.859
on the third day.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.059
Notice in chapter 20 here

00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:17.619
of the book of Matthew.

00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:22.479
In chapter 20 and verses 17-19,

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:24.619
He says, and Jesus going up to Jerusalem

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.799
took the twelve disciples apart in the way

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.259
and said unto them,

00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:30.699
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem

00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:32.339
and the Son of Man shall be betrayed

00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:33.579
unto the chief priests

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.979
and unto the scribes,

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:37.219
and they shall condemn Him to death

00:23:37.219 --> 00:23:39.339
and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:41.859
to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him.

00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:47.859
And the third day He shall rise again.

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:51.979
Again, in chapter 26 and verse 32,

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.159
Jesus is here.

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:56.839
This is really during the betrayal

00:23:56.839 --> 00:24:00.679
and leading up to all that would take place

00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:04.039
with the hearings and the scourging

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:05.199
and the crucifixion.

00:24:05.199 --> 00:24:07.199
And we find that leading up to this,

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:10.239
Jesus says in verse 32,

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:12.879
But after I am risen again,

00:24:12.879 --> 00:24:17.039
I will go before you into Galilee.

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:20.259
See, Jesus had made His disciples aware

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:23.359
of the plan that Jesus would go

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.639
to that cruel cross,

00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.759
that He would suffer greatly,

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:30.039
that He would die.

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:32.579
But then that He would rise again.

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:35.399
See, the angel in this interaction

00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:37.199
that's recorded in the first few verses

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:38.479
of Matthew 28,

00:24:38.479 --> 00:24:39.839
he makes this announcement

00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:43.160
and he encourages these women

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.079
and he says, fear not.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:46.639
I know that you seek Jesus

00:24:46.639 --> 00:24:49.000
which was crucified.

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:50.699
He's not here.

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:53.220
For He is risen as He said.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.239
Notice not only the interaction,

00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:57.160
notice number two if you're taking notes,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.440
the invitation to see the tomb.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.979
It's interesting as you complete

00:25:00.979 --> 00:25:03.419
verse 6, it says in the first part there,

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:05.579
He is not here for He is risen as He said.

00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:07.319
But then notice the latter part

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.339
of verse 6.

00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:10.839
It contains really an invitation.

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:13.079
An invitation that's extended to these two women

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:15.119
to come and to see the place

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:17.039
where the Lord lay.

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:19.739
Can you imagine being there?

00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:21.979
As they arrive there early.

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.699
The Bible records for us

00:25:23.699 --> 00:25:25.579
as you look at various portions

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:27.380
and the record that's given

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.779
through the Gospel accounts

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:31.099
how that they arrive there at the tomb

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:32.459
and you find that here

00:25:32.459 --> 00:25:35.259
that the angel says,

00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:40.660
come, see the place where the Lord lay.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.419
He's not there anymore.

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:43.779
We can read John's account

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:45.220
and see about the folded napkin

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.259
and read all of that.

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:47.599
It's wonderful to do

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:49.000
and to study that.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.799
What great truth is there

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.319
with regard to His plan of returning.

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.919
And we look forward to that day

00:25:56.919 --> 00:25:58.720
when Jesus will come again.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.880
But we find here that this invitation

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.199
that is extended,

00:26:02.199 --> 00:26:04.279
the invitation to see the tomb,

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.079
really what was happening here

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:09.119
is they were going to have evidence

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:11.319
of Christ's resurrection.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:12.959
They were going to go into the very place

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:14.720
where Jesus was laid.

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:18.099
The very place where they laid His dead body

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:20.699
after they took Him off of the cross of Calvary.

00:26:20.699 --> 00:26:22.259
And they go into that tomb

00:26:22.259 --> 00:26:25.380
and they find that the tomb is empty.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.099
The evidence of the resurrection.

00:26:28.099 --> 00:26:29.579
See, this invitation is given.

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:30.899
I'm glad that they go in.

00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:32.619
And they're going to see the place

00:26:32.619 --> 00:26:33.699
where the Lord lay.

00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:35.940
Can I tell you that this evidence

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.739
is very well known.

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:39.579
We mentioned already the way

00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:41.579
in which the soldiers reacted

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:43.539
and the way in which they were paid off

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:45.359
to make up their story.

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:46.359
But I want you to consider

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:47.839
a couple of portions of Scripture

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:50.399
and other areas of the Bible.

00:26:50.399 --> 00:26:51.799
Notice in Acts 1,

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.479
notice what Luke says as he's writing here

00:26:55.479 --> 00:26:58.799
to Theophilus as it's mentioned.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.720
Of course, the record of the early church

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.039
and the works of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:06.720
through the apostles and the foundation

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.639
of the church and all of those things.

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:10.399
But we notice in the very beginning of Acts

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:11.919
in chapter number one,

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.299
that here is what is said in verse number,

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.819
let me just read the first three verses.

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:18.500
The former treaties have I made,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.019
O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:22.940
both to do and to teach.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.579
Until the day in which he was taken up

00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:27.279
after that he, through the Holy Ghost,

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.099
had given commandments unto the apostles

00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:30.619
to whom he had chosen,

00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:33.940
to whom also he showed himself alive

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.139
after his passion by,

00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:37.459
look at these three words,

00:27:37.459 --> 00:27:41.739
many infallible proofs.

00:27:41.739 --> 00:27:43.399
Being seen of them forty days

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:46.720
and speaking of the things pertaining

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.799
to the kingdom of God.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.059
In just a few verses,

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:51.500
the record of Christ's ascension

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.139
will be given to us here in Acts chapter number one.

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:57.000
We can see that in Luke 24 as well.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.380
But we find here that the truth is given

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.959
that he showed himself alive

00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:04.000
after his passion,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.119
after his death,

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:07.440
by many infallible proofs.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.279
Turn to 1 Corinthians chapter number 15,

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.279
if you will.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:13.739
Look at the evidence that Paul gives.

00:28:13.739 --> 00:28:16.299
We mentioned as we read a portion of this Scripture

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.519
to begin this morning in verses 12

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.380
down through verse number 23.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.739
But I want you to notice the beginning

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.179
of 1 Corinthians 15.

00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:24.859
Of course, this is the great chapter

00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:26.259
on the resurrection

00:28:26.259 --> 00:28:28.940
and the impact that that truth has upon us

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.660
as believers.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.119
But we notice in verse number one

00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:33.739
of 1 Corinthians 15,

00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:34.580
Paul says this,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.140
moreover brethren,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.339
I declare unto you the gospel

00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:39.500
which I preached unto you

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.919
which also you have received

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.559
and wherein ye stand.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:45.059
By which also you're saved

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:47.080
if you keep in memory what I preached unto you

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.000
unless ye have believed in vain.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.719
Notice in verse three,

00:28:50.719 --> 00:28:52.599
for I delivered unto you first of all

00:28:52.599 --> 00:28:55.039
that which I also received,

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:58.440
how that Christ died for our sins

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.099
according to the Scriptures.

00:29:01.099 --> 00:29:03.159
Paul's going to outline, define if you will,

00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:04.159
the gospel.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.719
And it begins with that truth

00:29:05.719 --> 00:29:07.320
of the death of our Savior.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.239
Notice here in this passage

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.619
that you'll see the reference

00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:13.539
according to the Scriptures.

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:14.820
You can go back to the Old Testament.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.419
You can study and you can read

00:29:16.419 --> 00:29:19.700
and understand how that the Passover

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.619
and all of those things,

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:22.140
how that they pointed to the fact

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.580
that Messiah would come

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.539
and that He would die a substitutionary death.

00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:29.260
And we find that those offerings

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.500
pointed to Messiah.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.020
They pointed to Christ.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.299
And we find here that He says

00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:34.500
according to the Scriptures

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.339
in verse number four,

00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:38.179
and that He was buried

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.640
and that He rose again the third day,

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.440
again, according to the Scriptures.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.640
Now notice the evidence.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.200
And that He was seen of Cephas,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.559
then of the twelve.

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:54.320
After that, He was seen of above

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.399
five hundred brethren at once,

00:29:57.399 --> 00:29:58.799
of whom the greater part

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.039
remain unto this present,

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:00.959
but some are fallen asleep.

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:01.799
You know what he's saying there

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:06.519
number six, he's saying that not only was he seen of Cephas and the twelve, but

00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:10.739
then he says in verse number six that he was seen of above 500 brethren at one

00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:16.019
time, and many of them were still alive. In other words, you could go speak to

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:21.579
these eyewitnesses of the resurrected Christ. The evidence was there, the

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:24.779
invitation to see the tomb that was extended to these two women, to Mary

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:30.139
Magdalene and the other Mary, that invitation was given, it was accepted, and

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:34.659
they were to see the evidence of Christ's resurrection. We find that Luke

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:39.299
mentions it in Acts 1, now Paul is mentioning it, and he says that of these

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:44.659
500 brethren, above 500 brethren at once, and many of them are still alive. He says

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:50.259
but some are fallen asleep, some have died, but many of them you could still go

00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:57.079
speak to. They could testify of seeing the resurrected Christ. He rose bodily

00:30:57.079 --> 00:31:02.119
from the dead. We find that there, well we'll get to that in just a moment,

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:07.199
notice in verse number seven, after that he was seen of James, then of all the

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:13.439
apostles, and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time.

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:19.079
See, we find the evidence to the truth that is given to us with regard to the

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:24.399
resurrection. This thing, as Paul even said as he stood before the leaders

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:29.719
there and gave testimony, said it was not done in a corner. This thing was well

00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:33.919
known. Why did they devise a plan as they did the conspiracy that's recorded in

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:39.639
Matthew 28 verses 11 through 15? Why did they devise this plan? Why did they have

00:31:39.639 --> 00:31:43.679
to pay off these soldiers? Because they were trying to cover up what had

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:48.639
happened, but the evidence supports, it gives reference to the fact that yes,

00:31:48.639 --> 00:31:53.459
according to the Scriptures, exactly what God said would happen has happened, and we

00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:58.819
find that invitation is extended. Now, we see there's an interaction. We see

00:31:58.819 --> 00:32:02.419
there's an invitation. Notice finally with me this morning, the instruction to

00:32:02.419 --> 00:32:07.019
tell his disciples. Notice in verse 7 that there is instruction that is given.

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:13.139
That instruction is this, and go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:19.339
from the dead. Notice they had the instruction. It contained that they were

00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:25.699
to go, not just go haphazardly or without purpose. No, go quickly, and then

00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:31.179
they were given who they were to go to. Go and tell his disciples. Tell them what?

00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:38.059
Tell them that he, Christ, is risen from the dead. And behold, he goeth before you

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:42.779
into Galilee. We read already in Matthew 26 in verse number 32 how that he said

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:48.579
that when he was risen that he would go to Galilee. But after I am risen again, I

00:32:48.579 --> 00:32:52.739
will go before you into Galilee. And so we find here that he goeth before you

00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:59.459
into Galilee. There shall ye see him. Lo, I have told you. Can you imagine being the

00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:04.299
recipient of this instruction? Can you imagine the emotions that would fill

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:08.619
your soul at this particular time? I mean, they went there with a certain

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:13.099
expectation. They went there believing that they would anoint the body of

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:17.499
Christ with these ointments that they had. They believed that they were going

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:23.019
there. And then they arrived to that place, and the expectations are not what

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:26.819
they thought. And they meet this angel, and they have this interaction, and they

00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:30.819
go into the tomb, and they see the place where he was laid, but he's not there any

00:33:30.819 --> 00:33:34.379
longer. And then they receive the instruction to go quickly and tell his

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:39.659
disciples that he is risen from the dead. Go to Galilee, because that's where

00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:46.419
ye shall see him. Lo, I have told you. Notice they take the instruction that

00:33:46.419 --> 00:33:49.899
had been given to them, and they depart. The Bible says they departed quickly

00:33:49.899 --> 00:33:56.619
from the sepulcher. It says this, with fear and great joy, and did run to bring

00:33:56.619 --> 00:34:01.499
his disciples' word. Can you see? Yes, all of the emotions, the fear, the great joy,

00:34:01.499 --> 00:34:06.179
notice as they're running. I believe there's a level of excitement. They have

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:12.979
a message to give. They were there at the tomb early. They received the truth that

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:21.459
Christ is risen. He's not here. He is risen, as he said. Notice that as they go,

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:27.179
they are intercepted by our risen Savior. Can you imagine? In verse number nine, it

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:31.179
says, as they went to tell his disciples, they were being obedient to do that

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:36.419
which they had been instructed. The Bible says that Jesus met them, and they said,

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:42.819
it's saying, all hail. What do they do? They held him by the feet, and they

00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:47.379
worshipped him. Remember, we read there in Revelation chapter number one, and John

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:55.459
fell before him as dead. We find the importance of worshipping. I mentioned as

00:34:55.459 --> 00:35:00.619
I preached through the book of Hebrews, we looked at the truth with regard to

00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:06.459
the fact that Christ is superior. He's superior to the angels, and we mentioned

00:35:06.459 --> 00:35:11.059
that specifically, and we spoke during that particular message as to why he's

00:35:11.059 --> 00:35:14.859
superior to the angels. What evidence do we have? Of course, he is the creator, and

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:20.379
the angels are created beings, but one of the truths that we shared as we studied

00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:24.220
that passage of Scripture was that angels worship, but they are never

00:35:24.379 --> 00:35:30.139
worshipped. See, Christ is worshipped, and here we find that the risen Savior,

00:35:30.139 --> 00:35:35.739
Christ, receives worship. It says that they held him by the feet and worshipped

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:43.579
him. Can you imagine? I mean, what a time this must have been. What a sweet

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:48.139
encounter. I'm glad. I'm sure they were rejoicing that they were intercepted by

00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:53.619
our risen Savior, that Jesus met them as they were going, as they were obeying, and

00:35:53.619 --> 00:36:00.220
notice that Jesus then would comfort them and instruct them. The instruction

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.699
is that which we find that they'd already been given, but notice in verse

00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:09.739
number 10, then said Jesus unto them, be not afraid. Go tell my brethren that they

00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:15.459
go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. I want you to notice as we skip the

00:36:15.459 --> 00:36:21.739
section there of the conspiracy, as it's given the deceitful plan that those

00:36:21.739 --> 00:36:27.099
folks came up with, and they gave the money to the soldiers to make up the

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:30.699
story about the disciples stealing the body of Christ, and I want you to skip

00:36:30.699 --> 00:36:35.859
over that for sake of time this morning and look at verse number 16. It says this,

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:41.299
then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee. Why'd they go? Evidently, Mary

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:45.019
Magdalene and Mary arrived and gave them the news, right? They obeyed. They

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:51.539
fulfilled that which they were told to do. I can only imagine the interaction

00:36:51.539 --> 00:36:55.220
that must have taken place. I can only imagine the excitement that as they

00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:00.139
began to speak and to share their experience that they had there at the

00:37:00.139 --> 00:37:05.459
tomb early that morning, that as they come in and they say, he's not there, he's

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:11.579
risen, and as we were coming back, he met us in the way. We need to go to

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:18.299
Galilee. The Bible says that they went into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus

00:37:18.339 --> 00:37:24.500
had appointed them. Again, not to repeat myself too much this morning, but you

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.619
find that in Matthew 26 and verse 32 where he gave them that truth that he

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:33.500
would appear to them in Galilee, and notice what happens. It says, and when

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:42.599
they saw him, they worshipped him. When they saw him, they worshipped him. Could

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:47.619
you imagine the scene in Galilee? Can you imagine as they saw the resurrected

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:52.699
Christ? I mean, we can understand the emotions of the previous week and all

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:56.299
that had taken place, all that had transpired in their lives. I think about

00:37:56.299 --> 00:37:59.379
the emotions that are recorded throughout the Word of God, throughout the

00:37:59.379 --> 00:38:04.139
records of Scripture with regard to these days of the crucifixion and

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:10.220
the burial and then the resurrection and how the despair and the

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.099
sadness and even the countenance of those that were walking back to Emmaus

00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:19.099
being sad and we find now that there's a level of joy as we mentioned that Mary

00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:23.619
Magdalene and the other Mary, they had great joy that they ran to bring the

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:30.619
disciples' word and now they see him and they worship him. He is worthy of worship.

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:37.299
Why? Because he fulfilled that which he said he would do. He conquered sin, death

00:38:37.299 --> 00:38:45.299
and the grave. He rose in victory and we find here that the text of Scripture

00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:55.899
ends in verse number 17 with this truth, but some doubted, but some doubted. Jesus

00:38:55.899 --> 00:39:00.260
would then give them instruction. We often refer to verses 18 through 20 as

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.019
the Great Commission. I will not take time this morning to get into that, but

00:39:04.019 --> 00:39:07.500
we understand that it is our responsibility to take the message of

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.580
the gospel as defined by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, that which we

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.299
looked at just a moment ago, that Christ died according to the Scriptures, that he

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:19.859
was buried and that he rose again according to the Scriptures, that we take

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:25.339
that message into all the world, that we preach the gospel to every creature, that

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:29.979
we serve a risen Savior, that he conquered sin, death and the grave. We

00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:34.619
find that there are some that doubted. I want you to keep that thought and turn to

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:39.700
the book of Acts, if you will, to the 17th chapter. We'll conclude with this

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:46.659
passage of Scripture this morning. See, we're to preach that we serve a risen

00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:53.539
Savior, that he rose in victory on the third day. As we read the book of Acts, as

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:57.539
you read the sermons that are contained within the book of Acts, as you read the

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:01.339
sermons of Peter and Paul and Stephen, you find that there is a...

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:07.259
a reference, regular reference, to the fact that Jesus rose from the dead.

00:40:07.259 --> 00:40:11.819
Again, it is the cornerstone of our faith, and we find that in Acts chapter number 17,

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:18.139
God gives us various truths that are contained here with regard to the ministry of the Apostle

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:23.299
Paul, his time there at Thessalonica, and his time in Berea, and then we come there

00:40:23.299 --> 00:40:29.619
to the latter part of chapter number 17, and we read about Paul's ministry there in Athens.

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:35.859
We find that as Paul would stand there in the midst of Mars Hill that he begins to preach

00:40:35.859 --> 00:40:39.059
a message to them, and he says in verse number 23,

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:45.139
For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription to

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:50.739
the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:54.259
Him declare I unto you.

00:40:54.259 --> 00:40:58.379
And then he begins in verse number 24, God that made the world and all things therein,

00:40:58.379 --> 00:41:03.019
seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, and

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:06.499
he goes through this message, we won't take time, but what's he doing?

00:41:06.499 --> 00:41:12.019
He's declaring Christ to these people, the true and living God.

00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:16.419
We find that he comes to verse number 31, Because he hath appointed a day in the which

00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:21.719
he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained, that's speaking

00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:27.879
of Jesus Christ, wherefore he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised

00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:30.079
him from the dead.

00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:34.679
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, notice the threefold response.

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:37.559
They heard of the resurrection of the dead.

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:41.279
It says this, Some mocked.

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:43.279
Some mocked.

00:41:43.279 --> 00:41:48.599
Others, they say we will hear thee again on this matter, they're inquisitive, they wanted

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:50.959
to hear more.

00:41:50.959 --> 00:41:55.859
Yet we find that as Paul departed from them, it tells us in verse number 34, certain men

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:59.439
claimed unto him and believed.

00:41:59.439 --> 00:42:00.439
And believed.

00:42:00.439 --> 00:42:07.599
The threefold response that we find, some mocked, some wanted to learn more, some believed.

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:12.199
There back in our text in Matthew 28, we find that it's recorded for us in verses 16 and

00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:19.679
17 that they go to Galilee and that they saw him and worshipped him, but some doubted.

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:20.719
Some doubted.

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:26.559
See, this morning, when you understand the truth of that which we have laid out before

00:42:26.559 --> 00:42:31.279
you this morning, we understand the truth of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:36.119
and all of the ramifications of that truth and how he died for our sins according to

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:37.119
the Scriptures.

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.959
He was buried, but he rose in victory on the third day.

00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:44.999
We find that when we give that message, there are some that will mock.

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:49.479
There are some that will say, I want to learn more about this, and there are some that believe.

00:42:50.279 --> 00:42:53.279
I wonder this morning, which category do you fit into?

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:59.079
I wonder this morning, we've asked the question early in our message this morning with regard

00:42:59.079 --> 00:43:05.319
to the reference in Matthew chapter number 16 when Jesus said, whom say ye that I am?

00:43:05.319 --> 00:43:08.319
He asked before that, who do men say that I am?

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.119
But he says, who do you say that I am?

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:13.759
And I wonder this morning, who do you say that Christ is?

00:43:13.759 --> 00:43:19.999
I wonder this morning, how do you react, how do you respond when you hear of the resurrection

00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:25.439
of the dead, that Jesus, in fact, died and rose bodily from the dead, conquering sin,

00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:26.439
death, and the grave?

00:43:26.439 --> 00:43:27.879
How do you respond?

00:43:27.879 --> 00:43:29.479
I hope that you believe.

00:43:29.479 --> 00:43:33.919
I hope that in faith, you believe the message of the Bible.

00:43:33.919 --> 00:43:39.439
You see the evidence is given, and we've mentioned that already with regard to that invitation

00:43:39.439 --> 00:43:40.439
that was extended.

00:43:40.439 --> 00:43:46.279
I wonder this morning, maybe there's one that's listening, you've never trusted the

00:43:46.279 --> 00:43:48.799
Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.

00:43:48.799 --> 00:43:53.519
Oh, it's our prayer this morning that the Holy Spirit of God, according to the truth

00:43:53.519 --> 00:44:00.119
that we find in the book of John, would convict you of your sin, of Christ's righteousness

00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:06.279
and of judgment to come, understanding that Jesus is the only way.

00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:07.759
There's no work that you could do.

00:44:07.759 --> 00:44:08.899
There's no good deed.

00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:12.139
There's no money you could pay.

00:44:12.139 --> 00:44:19.139
The only thing that can atone for your sin is the blood of Jesus Christ, and He conquered

00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:24.659
the grave, He conquered death, and we serve a risen Savior.

00:44:24.659 --> 00:44:26.659
He is risen.

00:44:26.659 --> 00:44:28.299
Do you believe it?

00:44:28.299 --> 00:44:30.379
Do you believe that He did that for you?

00:44:30.379 --> 00:44:34.259
See, this morning, if we could work our way to heaven, if we could earn heaven by our

00:44:34.259 --> 00:44:39.659
own merit, our own good, we'd have to ask the question, why did Christ die?

00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:44.779
In fact, the Apostle Paul really kind of, though he doesn't use that same terminology

00:44:44.779 --> 00:44:49.739
that I just used, he said, I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if righteousness came

00:44:49.739 --> 00:44:55.539
by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

00:44:55.539 --> 00:44:59.879
And this morning, Jesus Christ died on the cross of Calvary.

00:44:59.879 --> 00:45:06.479
He was buried in a borrowed tomb, and He rose in victory on the third day, why?

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:10.139
To be your Savior, to be my Savior.

00:45:10.139 --> 00:45:14.139
Because man was separated from God because of our sin.

00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:16.159
As in Adam, all die.

00:45:16.159 --> 00:45:19.439
We mentioned that in 1 Corinthians chapter number 15, remember?

00:45:19.439 --> 00:45:23.759
And we looked there that he says, as in Adam, all die.

00:45:23.759 --> 00:45:30.519
But in Christ, it says here, shall all be made alive.

00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:35.359
You could reference Romans chapter number 5, and you can see the impact, the effects

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:39.959
of the sin of Adam as it's recorded in Genesis chapter number 3.

00:45:39.959 --> 00:45:46.039
But then you can see the impact, the effect of the obedience of Christ, that which we've

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:49.519
dealt with this morning, and the impact upon mankind.

00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:52.879
Oh, that you would receive the free gift.

00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:59.079
Romans 6 says, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through

00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:01.199
Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:46:01.199 --> 00:46:03.159
How did He pay for that gift?

00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:04.799
With His own blood.

00:46:04.799 --> 00:46:07.239
But He rose in victory.

00:46:07.239 --> 00:46:08.999
He is risen.

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:12.199
Remember, the angel said, I know why you're here.

00:46:12.199 --> 00:46:16.879
I know that you seek Christ, which was crucified.

00:46:16.879 --> 00:46:23.319
But He's not here, for He is risen as He said.

00:46:23.319 --> 00:46:24.319
Shall we pray?

00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:25.599
Father, we love You.

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:26.919
We thank You for loving us.

00:46:26.919 --> 00:46:29.519
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:46:29.519 --> 00:46:33.359
We thank You for the great truth of the Gospel.

00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:39.479
Lord, we know that it's the hope of mankind.

00:46:39.479 --> 00:46:48.879
Our sin separates us from God.

00:46:48.879 --> 00:46:54.359
So thankful for the plan of redemption.

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:59.119
Before the foundation of the world, as we find in verse Peter, Jesus is the Lamb of

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:03.519
God, slain before the foundation of the world.

00:47:03.519 --> 00:47:08.919
God, thank You for Your provision.

00:47:08.919 --> 00:47:14.859
We see, even as we study the book of Ephesians, the plan of redemption.

00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:20.359
We see the price of redemption, really that which we've dealt with this morning.

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:26.639
The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and then the proof of redemption.

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:31.119
We've been given the Holy Spirit of God, sealed unto the day of redemption.

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:33.119
What a joy.

00:47:33.919 --> 00:47:41.759
And Father, I pray that if there's one under the sound of my voice that does not know You

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:46.079
as their personal Lord and Savior, oh, they're searching.

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:52.719
Maybe they've been influenced by some quote-unquote religious teaching.

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:58.839
They've never understood the truth of the Gospel as it's given in the Word of God.

00:47:58.839 --> 00:48:04.559
Our sin separates us from Your holiness, and that our sin has a penalty.

00:48:04.559 --> 00:48:08.079
That penalty is death.

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.839
That Jesus died for us.

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:10.839
He took our place.

00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:18.999
The substitutionary atonement, as we often refer to it as, when He offers that free gift,

00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:24.039
all we have to do is receive it, accept it, that we might have eternal life.

00:48:24.039 --> 00:48:28.599
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:34.279
Father, if there's one this morning that does not know You as their Lord and Savior, it's

00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:37.519
my prayer that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:48:37.519 --> 00:48:46.159
Lord, I pray for every believer, oh God, would You help us to be encouraged, to know that

00:48:46.159 --> 00:48:53.959
we serve a risen Savior, to be encouraged by the truth of Thy Word, to have that joy,

00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:57.999
hope, strength, courage.

00:48:57.999 --> 00:48:58.999
Why?

00:48:58.999 --> 00:49:01.399
Because You live.

00:49:01.399 --> 00:49:08.799
As You said there in Revelation, as we read that passage of Scripture, I am alive forevermore.

00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:09.799
What a blessing.

00:49:09.799 --> 00:49:14.799
I pray, God, that You would work in our hearts and lives, help us to draw close to Thee,

00:49:14.799 --> 00:49:17.879
help us to please Thee with our lives, and we'll thank You for it.

00:49:17.879 --> 00:49:20.319
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
