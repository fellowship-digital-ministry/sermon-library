1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
And, of course, I mentioned this morning that the message was going to be a two-part message.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,920
This morning we looked at part number one, we examined a couple of principles.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,119
This evening we'll look at three additional truths from this book that I trust will be

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,920
a blessing to you.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,459
And the title was adopted from a phrase in verse number 11 of 1 Thessalonians 2.

6
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:26,399
And look at verse 10 with me and we'll get into the message.

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,520
The Bible says in verse 10 of 1 Thessalonians 2,

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:39,020
Ye are witnesses, and God also, how wholly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:47,479
among you that believe, as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one

10
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:54,900
of you, then notice the phrase, as a father doth his children, that ye would walk worthy

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,740
of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,819
The phrase, of course, to end verse number 11 is the phrase that we've used for our title

13
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,959
this evening will be part two, as a father doth his children.

14
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,459
And as we understand this book of 1 Thessalonians, just a brief overview this morning, we briefly

15
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:15,459
went through these things.

16
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:20,419
Paul, of course, is writing to a church, a local body of believers, and he's writing

17
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:25,059
to this church as a church leader, and he's imparting truth to them, and he's seeking

18
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,660
to encourage them.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,580
And we find that the church in Thessalonica is a model church, it's a good church.

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,180
And Paul is seeking to encourage them and instruct them.

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,120
And we find that he uses this phrase, as a father doth his children, and as we looked

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,900
at that phrase and we understood as we would take the truths that we're looking at this

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,419
day, both this morning and tonight, that we would understand that we're looking at them

24
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:50,980
really from two perspectives.

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,860
Number one is a father to a child, from a parent to a child, and the importance of that

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,260
relationship and the importance of following these principles.

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,059
And then we looked at it from the perspective of dealing with a mature believer to a growing

28
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,059
believer.

29
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:15,699
The reality is that we have the opportunity to be engaged in influencing, discipling,

30
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:22,059
imparting truth to those that we assemble with, to those that are younger in their walk

31
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,259
with Christ, that we would bring them along in their journey, and that we would impart

32
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,300
truth to them.

33
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,940
The two principles that we discussed this morning, number one, impart biblical truth.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,699
The Apostle Paul, as he arrived, he and his team of missionaries, as they arrived into

35
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,020
the city of Thessalonica, we understand, the Bible tells us in Acts 17 and verse number

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,419
two, that they reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

37
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,500
And how important it is that we would impart biblical truth.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,160
We live in a society that can easily be described as being biblically ignorant.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,220
It's unfortunate, however, that there are those even sitting within quote-unquote churches

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,899
that are even biblically ignorant, because there's a lack of imparting of spiritual truth,

41
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:10,899
of biblical truth, and how important it is that we preach and teach the Word of God.

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:16,339
We find that not only did we discuss the fact that it's imperative, you guys can come on

43
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:20,800
up, you're not going to disturb me, come on up, Trejos, if you want, that's not a problem.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,179
And Mr. Armando got a new toy today, and so I'm not sure if that's the reason for the

45
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:32,059
delay or not, but I understand if you need your grass cut, just contact Brother Armando,

46
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:36,179
and man, he's got a new riding mower and he's all excited about it, amen?

47
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:37,179
Is that right?

48
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,179
Am I pretty accurate?

49
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,179
Amen.

50
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,179
Yeah, amen!

51
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,419
He cut his grass two times today.

52
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,460
Now back to the message, sorry for the interruption, amen?

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,419
Back to the message, we find that we're to impart biblical truth, but then we talked

54
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:55,220
about the importance of modeling biblical truth, that we are to model biblical truth,

55
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,779
that we are to live.

56
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:02,839
Remember the truth that the message of our life is far more impactful than the message

57
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:08,580
of our lips, and the reality is that the message of our life ought to agree with the message

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,380
of our lips.

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,220
Do you teach not to steal, but you steal?

60
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,979
Remember Romans chapter number two.

61
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:19,980
And so obviously we understand that we need to be imparting biblical truth, but then we

62
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,359
need to model biblical truth.

63
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:28,720
Someone that's watching you, someone that's observing you, are they seeing in you that

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,200
you're living out the biblical truth that you claim to believe?

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,399
I've often said this over the years, that belief impacts behavior.

66
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,700
I believe that.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,799
What you believe impacts how you behave.

68
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:50,679
But I also believe that behavior reveals belief.

69
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:54,320
How you behave reveals what you believe.

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,519
And the reality this evening, as we look this morning quite extensively, we need to impart

71
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,359
biblical truth and we need to model biblical truth.

72
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,959
And again, the whole goal that we're working towards, not only through those two truths,

73
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,720
but the three that we'll look at this evening, is the goal that is mentioned in verse number

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:21,600
12, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,959
You know, the greatest desire, I understand as parents, God's given Holly and I the opportunity

76
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,079
to have three children, and what a blessing children are.

77
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,079
And I understand as parents that we have desires for our children and we have goals and desires

78
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,279
that they would be successful and so on and so forth.

79
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,359
But you know, the greatest desire we ought to have as Christian parents is that our children

80
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:50,040
would walk worthy of God.

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,959
That our children would live a life that is pleasing to God Almighty.

82
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,119
Because if they're living a life that is pleasing to God Almighty, I'm going to say that they're

83
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,339
living a life that would be pleasing in your sight as well, amen?

84
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:08,399
And so this evening, as we have that goal in mind and look at this second part, notice

85
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:12,760
with me tonight, number one this evening, number three of the truths that we're looking

86
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
at, pray for your children.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,799
This is real practical tonight.

88
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,760
We dealt with, in part, biblical truth, model biblical truth.

89
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,679
This evening, think about this, pray for your children.

90
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,279
Pray for your children.

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,559
You know, it's interesting as you study the Word of God, in particular studying the New

92
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:33,640
Testament, reading and studying the books that God used the Apostle Paul to pen from

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,559
a human perspective, it is of note to study those books and to see how often Paul tells

94
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,880
those believers, I'm praying for you.

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,279
I'm praying for you.

96
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,959
And it's of interest that not only in many cases, he not only just says, I'm praying

97
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,679
for you, but he tells them how he's praying for them.

98
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,779
And how impactful that is.

99
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,920
Not only do we see that Paul would communicate to those that he's ministering to that he's

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,239
praying for them, but we find that Paul then also would request prayer for himself.

101
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,320
He would request, even as we looked this morning at 1 Thessalonians 5, brethren, pray for us.

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Simple request.

103
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,839
But, you know, prayer is a unique privilege that we have as the people of God.

104
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,600
That we can enter into the throne room of heaven, that we can have confidence that our

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,559
God hears us, we understand the wonderful promises that God has given us, that He is

106
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,519
going to answer us, that He's able to answer.

107
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,119
He's able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

108
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:42,119
He said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty

109
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:45,279
things which thou knowest not.

110
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:53,359
The reality is that prayer reveals our dependence upon God.

111
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,880
Miss Joyce gave me a little poem this morning.

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,359
She handed it to me and said, Happy Father's Day.

113
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:04,279
And it says this, the title of the poem from a man by the name of Frank Jones, I heard

114
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,160
my father pray.

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,640
My hand was on the doorknob for the door was closed that day.

116
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,519
I wondered who had closed it.

117
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:23,920
Then I heard my father say, Oh Lord, bless my children and help me day by day to be the

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,000
kind of father that will never want to stray.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,400
My heart was overflowing as I heard your pleas that day.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Those moments were so precious for I heard my father pray.

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,760
My hand slipped from the doorknob.

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,640
I quietly went and prayed.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,760
I asked God to send more fathers who will close the door and pray.

124
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,039
Oh, that we'd pray for our children.

125
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,239
As I think about this truth of praying for our children, notice in 1 Thessalonians how

126
00:08:56,239 --> 00:09:00,520
Paul is praying for these that God would give him the opportunity to minister to.

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,719
In 1 Thessalonians 1, notice in verse number 2, notice what Paul says.

128
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:11,400
Right in the introduction, we give thanks to God always for you all, making mention

129
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,640
of you in our prayers.

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Paul says, I'm praying for you.

131
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,500
I'm making mention of you in our prayers.

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,859
In chapter number 2, notice as you continue to go through the passage of scripture, we

133
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:33,820
find that Paul is giving to them the truth that he is seeking as he's praying for them.

134
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,580
He's seeking to give them this truth that they were allowed of God, but they're praying

135
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,500
and he's gentle among them and he's giving them truth.

136
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,020
It says in verse number 9, for you remember brethren, our labor and travail for laboring

137
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,419
night and day because we would not be chargeable to any of you.

138
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,299
We preached unto you the gospel of God.

139
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,700
We understand that he's saying there that we're laboring and travailing and you think

140
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,940
about the labor and

141
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,860
the travail of prayer.

142
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,240
We understand that no doubt

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,580
v. 9 could communicate to us

144
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,260
a number of aspects of the labor and travail,

145
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,880
but you understand this evening

146
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,660
that prayer is labor?

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,500
Prayers work.

148
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,940
You travail in prayer.

149
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
You labor in prayer.

150
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,080
And we find that Paul is saying

151
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,180
to these believers,

152
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,340
listen, we're praying for you.

153
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,680
And we are praying because we understand

154
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
that God hears and answers prayer.

155
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Look at v. 20 of chapter 2.

156
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,020
The Bible says,

157
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,720
for you are our glory and joy.

158
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,240
I think about Paul making this statement

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,560
and giving to these believers this truth

160
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,640
with regard to the fact

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,200
that they held a special part in his heart.

162
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
And it reminds me of what Paul says

163
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
to the believers in Philippi.

164
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
Hold your place here

165
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
and turn to Philippians 1, if you will.

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Look at Philippians 1.

167
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,920
And notice what Paul is saying

168
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,520
to these believers in Philippi.

169
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,840
He says this in v. 3,

170
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,440
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

171
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,920
always in every prayer of mine

172
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
for you all making request with joy.

173
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Notice v. 7.

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,920
Even as it is for me to think this of you all,

175
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,600
notice, because I have you in my heart.

176
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,720
And as much as both in my bonds

177
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel,

178
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
ye all are partakers of my grace.

179
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,760
For God is my record.

180
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,880
How greatly I long after you all

181
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
in the bowels of Jesus Christ.

182
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,800
And this I pray,

183
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
that your love may abound yet more and more

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
in knowledge and in all judgment,

185
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,880
that you may approve things that are excellent,

186
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,840
that you may be sincere and without offense

187
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,279
till the day of Christ,

188
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,560
being filled with the fruits of righteousness

189
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,480
which are by Jesus Christ

190
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,720
unto the glory and praise of God.

191
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
And here, as he's writing to the believers in Thessalonica,

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,360
he says to them that ye are our glory and joy.

193
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,040
Just as the believers in Philippi

194
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,559
were on the heart of the Apostle Paul,

195
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,600
these believers in Thessalonica were on the heart of Paul.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,520
And no doubt, because they were,

197
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,400
as he would refer to them as being his glory and joy,

198
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,919
no doubt he's praying for them.

199
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,800
He's mindful.

200
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,199
You know, when you have somebody on your heart,

201
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,119
it's easy to have them in your prayers.

202
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
They're on your heart.

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,119
And we find here that Paul is seeking

204
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,440
to encourage these believers

205
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
by letting them know that he's praying for them.

206
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,720
Notice in chapter number three in verse number 10,

207
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,199
notice the phraseology that he uses.

208
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,800
Night and day, praying exceedingly,

209
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,919
that we might see your face and might perfect that

210
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,639
which is lacking in your faith.

211
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,880
We understand that Paul had a desire to go to visit them.

212
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,360
He says that in verse number 18 of chapter two,

213
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
wherefore, we would have come unto you,

214
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,520
even I, Paul, once and again, but Satan hindered us.

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,080
And then he talks about night and day,

216
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,360
praying exceedingly that we might see your face.

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,400
And again, the encouragement that one receives

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,199
when they understand that someone is praying for them.

219
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,040
You know, who better to pray for your children than you?

220
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,479
When we think about it from that application

221
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,119
of a parent to a child, we see that,

222
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,160
but think about it even from the application

223
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,279
of a mature believer seeking to influence

224
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,960
a growing believer.

225
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
You know, when you're imparting truth

226
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,199
and modeling truth to a growing believer,

227
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:40,559
and you're engaged in prayer for that believer,

228
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,839
that you're praying that God would help them

229
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,760
to grasp the particular truths in which you're dealing with

230
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
and maybe the obstacles and the difficulties

231
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
in which they're dealing with,

232
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,400
because there are some things that you know

233
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,199
about their walk and where they are in their journey

234
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,639
and what's going on, because the reality is

235
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,680
that you're in a place where, through that discipleship

236
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
and through imparting and modeling biblical truth to them,

237
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,119
they may open up to you and they may share some things

238
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,600
with you of some difficulties, some challenges

239
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,160
that they're experiencing, and you then can go to God

240
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,199
on their behalf and intercede for them.

241
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
Because you know some things that are going on

242
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
that someone else may not know.

243
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:25,040
When we think about the ministry of intercessory prayer,

244
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,720
we understand that it requires knowledge.

245
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,760
How is it that we can pray one for another?

246
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
I'm not suggesting that we need to know

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,720
every single thing about someone,

248
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,559
but as you know some things that are going on

249
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,279
in the life of an individual,

250
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,640
as you know some things are going on

251
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,880
in the lives of your children,

252
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,720
then you can better intercede on their behalf.

253
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,320
Think about this in chapter number three

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,760
of 1 Thessalonians, when we think about this truth

255
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,880
of praying for your children, I believe that it's important

256
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,860
that we recognize the battles that they face.

257
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,679
I know that there are times that I have said to my children

258
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,119
when something's going on in a particular stage

259
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,940
or some difficulty, and I might make a comment

260
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,920
something like this, I've been 16 before,

261
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,040
you know, I understand, I've been there,

262
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,440
I know what you're going through sort of thing.

263
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,160
When we look at what Paul is saying

264
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,200
in 1 Thessalonians three in the first eight verses,

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,720
and it helps us to understand the battles

266
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,119
that these individuals were facing.

267
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,040
Remember, as we discussed this morning,

268
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,839
Paul said that he gave them truth,

269
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,959
even though they were shamefully entreated,

270
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,600
even though they dealt with much contention and opposition,

271
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,880
he imparted truth to these believers.

272
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,440
But then notice what he says beginning in verse number one

273
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,760
of 1 Thessalonians three.

274
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,959
Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

275
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,220
we thought it good to be left at Athens alone,

276
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,119
and sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God

277
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,959
and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ

278
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,959
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,

279
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,279
that no man should be moved by these afflictions,

280
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,519
for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

281
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,559
For verily, when we were with you,

282
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,440
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation,

283
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,760
even as it came to pass,

284
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,320
and ye know for this cause when I could no longer forbear,

285
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I sent to know your faith,

286
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,980
lest by some means the tempter have tempted you

287
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,320
and our labor be in vain.

288
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,440
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us

289
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,679
and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity,

290
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,779
and that you have good remembrance of us,

291
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,779
always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

292
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:46,459
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you

293
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,380
in all our affliction and distress by your faith,

294
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,839
for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord.

295
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,739
But I want you to notice specifically,

296
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,980
he talks about verse number three,

297
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,140
that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

298
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,860
He says, furthermore, that ye yourselves know

299
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,339
that we are appointed thereunto.

300
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,619
He says in verse number four, even we should suffer,

301
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,399
or excuse me, we told you before

302
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,720
that we should suffer tribulation.

303
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,880
He says in verse number five, that lest by some means

304
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,239
the tempter have tempted you and our labor be in vain.

305
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:21,640
I mean, when we understand the battles that someone faces,

306
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,399
it will lead us to prayer.

307
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,059
That we're going and engaging in intercessory prayer

308
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,880
on the behalf of our children,

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,720
on behalf of those growing believers

310
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,519
that we are influencing and impacting,

311
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,679
that we're imparting biblical truth to them.

312
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,480
Listen, there are some battles that your children face.

313
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,440
Amen?

314
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
Listen, I understand some of the battles

315
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
that your children face are the same types of battles

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,519
that we faced, but some of the battles that they face

317
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,580
are quite different than the battles that we faced.

318
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,519
You know, sin has always been sin,

319
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,880
and the devil has no new tricks,

320
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,679
but can I tell you that the access to wickedness

321
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
is so much greater today than it's ever been?

322
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,080
Honestly.

323
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,399
You know, I don't know what the percentage is.

324
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm sure you could do a quick Google search and find out,

325
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,040
but you know how many people are walking around

326
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,959
with these smartphones?

327
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,839
I mean, wickedness, if you're not careful,

328
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,200
it's accessible in a click, right?

329
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,360
Oh man, that we'd pray for our children,

330
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,640
that we'd understand that as we're seeking.

331
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,279
You say, I don't have any children at home.

332
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,600
I understand, that's wonderful,

333
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,159
but what about the believer that's growing

334
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,080
that you're seeking to influence and impart truth to them

335
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,280
and model truth to them?

336
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,159
Listen, they're facing some attacks from the enemy,

337
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,320
and if you understand that and you're aware

338
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
of the way in which they're being attacked,

339
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,520
it would lead us to a place of praying

340
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,260
more fervently for them.

341
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,080
It's a simple truth, but oh,

342
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,599
how we need to pray for our children.

343
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,159
We'd pray for them.

344
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,640
I mean, just make it a priority in our lives

345
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,320
that we spend a season of prayer for our children.

346
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,720
You know, God answers prayer,

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,080
and God works through the ministry of prayer

348
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,059
in ways that we can't even fully comprehend.

349
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,840
See, God's always at work, and as we pray,

350
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,640
and God is able to do what only God can do.

351
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, that we'd pray.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
Number two, not only that we'd pray for our children,

353
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,299
number two this evening, number four,

354
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,320
if you're looking at all of the truths,

355
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,919
but I want you to think about this.

356
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,260
Commend your children.

357
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,099
Commend them.

358
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,320
You know, I believe that it's important

359
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,640
that we acknowledge and verbalize.

360
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,559
I believe that as we look at Paul here

361
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,960
and looking at this truth from 1 Thessalonians

362
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,320
and looking at his behavior with these individual believers

363
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,479
and his interaction with them, he's commending them,

364
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,840
and the reality.

365
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,600
this evening is that, yes, He's challenging them,

366
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,680
He's seeking to push them along in their walk with God,

367
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,460
but He's commending the progress that they've made.

368
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,180
And I believe that sometimes in our lives,

369
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,700
and I'll speak for myself very personally,

370
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,820
I believe one of the pitfalls for me personally

371
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,980
is to point out weaknesses or failures

372
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,620
without acknowledging strengths and accomplishments.

373
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,340
It's a lot easier for us to say,

374
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,200
man, your room's dirty, what are you doing?

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
Than to say, hey, I walked by your room

376
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,800
and it looks really good.

377
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,940
I walk by the room and it looks really good,

378
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,780
I don't even think about it,

379
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,140
I just keep on going through my day,

380
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,580
and you understand what I'm saying?

381
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,320
And so we have to be aware of this,

382
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,600
and we need to acknowledge and verbalize,

383
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,460
and when we see that growth, when we see that progress,

384
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,280
when we see some development, we commend.

385
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,020
Notice what he says here, back to chapter number one,

386
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,360
notice in verse number three,

387
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,020
Paul mentioned in verse number two

388
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,300
how that he was praying for them

389
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,980
and he was thanking God for them.

390
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,620
He says then in verse number three,

391
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,900
remembering without ceasing,

392
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,100
notice what he remembers,

393
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,360
your work of faith, your labor of love,

394
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,900
and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ

395
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,820
in the sight of God and our Father.

396
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,860
I believe that Paul, as he's noting here

397
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
in verse number three, he's remembering some things,

398
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,000
he's remembering and he's acknowledging

399
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,460
and he's verbalizing here some things

400
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,300
that they were doing.

401
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,140
They had a work of faith.

402
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
They believed that God was able,

403
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,400
listen, the Bible says in verse number eight,

404
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,220
that from you, verse seven,

405
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,440
so that you were in samples

406
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,800
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

407
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,640
You know what Paul's saying?

408
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,220
You're an example.

409
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,500
You got it, we gave you truth,

410
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,940
we imparted truth to you, and you embraced it,

411
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,480
you received it, remember,

412
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,820
in chapter number two he says you received it

413
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,000
not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,520
the word of God which effectually worketh

415
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,320
also in you that believe,

416
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,800
and he says you were in samples,

417
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,880
and then he goes on to say in verse number eight,

418
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,360
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord

419
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

420
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
but also in every place your faith to God

421
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,040
were to spread abroad,

422
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
so that we need not to speak anything.

423
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,520
As I look at 1 Thessalonians 1.8,

424
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,360
you know what Paul is saying in verse 7 and 8?

425
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,940
He's saying, listen, you're being an example.

426
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,060
You're doing the work of the ministry,

427
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,600
your work of faith, your labor of love.

428
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,180
In just a little while we'll look at another verse

429
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,860
where he talks about them loving one another

430
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,160
as they're supposed to,

431
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,740
but you'll find that Paul is commending them,

432
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,880
he's acknowledging what they're doing.

433
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,780
Listen, it's easy to say,

434
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,580
man, you're not doing this, and you're not doing this,

435
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,060
and you're not doing this, and you're not doing this,

436
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,900
and you gotta do this.

437
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,580
It's easy for us to do that.

438
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,080
And sometimes what happens in the life of a child

439
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,720
is they just sit back and say,

440
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
can I do anything right?

441
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,480
I mean, what's the point?

442
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
Every time I turn around,

443
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm being told I'm not doing this,

444
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
and I'm not doing that,

445
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,120
and I need to do better with this.

446
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,200
You understand what I'm saying?

447
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,440
But as believers, sometimes we can fall in the same trap.

448
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,000
Where it's just that this truth of,

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,640
look, we're looking at the truth of God,

450
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,900
this truth of, look, we're looking at

451
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,220
not only parent to child,

452
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,100
but from a mature believer to a growing believer.

453
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,900
Listen, someone had grace and patience with you

454
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,780
when you were growing, hopefully.

455
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,720
And if not, you probably wouldn't be where you are today.

456
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm glad that some people had some patience with me.

457
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,060
You understand?

458
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,100
Because you didn't always do everything right

459
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,540
right after you got saved, and neither did I.

460
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,960
There's a work that God's doing in our lives.

461
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,120
We sing the song that God's still working on me

462
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,520
to make me what I ought to be.

463
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,080
I mean, listen, He created everything in just six days.

464
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,720
And that's part of that song.

465
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,360
And I mean, you read Genesis chapter one, it's amazing,

466
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,480
but He's still working on me.

467
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,120
Listen, sometimes you're investing

468
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,440
in the life of a baby Christian, of a growing believer,

469
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
and sometimes they just mess up.

470
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,080
What do you do?

471
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,600
How do you respond?

472
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,560
How do you bring them along?

473
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,840
How do you work through that?

474
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
We're sitting last Sunday night, we had a fellowship,

475
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,080
and Blake and Vanessa were sitting there,

476
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,200
and they had just gotten back from their vacation,

477
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,520
and I purposed to sit with them,

478
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,820
find out how things were going.

479
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,880
And man, little Ethan was just,

480
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
he was just spitting up all over the place.

481
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
And Vanessa, at one point, finally, she was like,

482
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,940
Blake, we just gotta go.

483
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,460
I mean, it was just, it was all over her.

484
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,860
He's a baby.

485
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,580
That's what he does, right?

486
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,100
I mean, you're not gonna get mad at the kid.

487
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,500
You're not gonna dispose of him.

488
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,180
No, he's a baby.

489
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,820
She wasn't mad at Ethan.

490
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,620
It was just time to go,

491
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,420
because she wanted to get her clothes changed.

492
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,300
You understand, right?

493
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
And so she walked in this morning,

494
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,100
and just in the humorous way in which she could,

495
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,940
because I shared with her how that Brianna,

496
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,280
she used to spit up like crazy when she was a baby.

497
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,520
And so I never held Brianna on a Sunday.

498
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
I just didn't.

499
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
When I had a suit on, I wasn't holding her.

500
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,440
And so Vanessa walks in this morning, Blake,

501
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,720
and she says, Pastor Chris, you wanna hold Ethan?

502
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,320
And I'm like, you're so funny, you know?

503
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,440
No, I don't wanna hold that kid, man.

504
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,560
I mean, I do, but just not right now,

505
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
you know what I mean?

506
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,240
But listen, we understand this in life.

507
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,720
Listen, sometimes even a mature believer

508
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,420
just fails, just messes up.

509
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,020
It's interesting to me, you know the account

510
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,380
after the first missionary journey,

511
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,740
really partway through the first missionary journey,

512
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,100
John forsook, right?

513
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,100
He left, and whatever happened, and so on and so forth,

514
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,940
and we find that it was a difficulty

515
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,900
that caused some division and caused some problems there

516
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,940
with, John Mark, it was, with the situation

517
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,420
between Paul and Barnabas.

518
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,420
But you know, Paul, before his death,

519
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,300
he said this in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 11,

520
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,980
take Mark and bring him with thee,

521
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,760
for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

522
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,480
I understand it caused some division.

523
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
You can read of it in Acts with Paul and Barnabas

524
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,860
and Mark, John Mark, and all that happened,

525
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,260
but eventually there was a time in Paul's life

526
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,140
where he said, listen, Mark is profitable

527
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,500
to me for the ministry.

528
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,760
He's grown, he's matured.

529
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,500
If someone was blind and they walked into you,

530
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
they bumped into you, you probably wouldn't

531
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,720
be real mad at them.

532
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,740
They're blind.

533
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,980
And we think about this truth of commending our children

534
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,580
and seeking to influence them and encourage them

535
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,180
and to acknowledge some things that they do that are right,

536
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,020
and even though there's gonna be some mess-ups,

537
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
I'm not suggesting that we don't correct them.

538
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,340
Please understand what I'm saying this evening.

539
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,260
We understand that we need to correct

540
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,820
and we need to reprove and rebuke,

541
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,900
and it's part of all of the package,

542
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,540
but sometimes what I'm simply saying is it's easier

543
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,040
to reprove and rebuke than it is to commend.

544
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,260
Sometimes it's just, man, it's in our wheelhouse

545
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,880
to just reprove and rebuke.

546
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,080
But commending is a different story.

547
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,540
Notice what Paul says in chapter two of 1 Thessalonians

548
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,260
in verse number seven.

549
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,940
We referenced this verse this morning,

550
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,900
but notice here he says this,

551
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,540
but we were gentle among you,

552
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,360
even as a nurse cherisheth her children.

553
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Gentle.

554
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
Gentle.

555
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,500
We notice in chapter number four,

556
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Paul again would commend these believers in Thessalonica.

557
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,440
He says this in verse number nine

558
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,360
of 1 Thessalonians four,

559
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,660
but as touching brotherly love,

560
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
ye need not that I write unto you.

561
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

562
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
Notice this, verse 10,

563
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,960
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren

564
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,620
which are in all Macedonia.

565
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,800
But we beseech you, brethren,

566
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,059
that ye increase more and more.

567
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,620
Commending them and acknowledging and verbalizing

568
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,980
that they were loving one another

569
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,220
did not prevent him, Paul,

570
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,100
from encouraging them to continue to grow in that manner.

571
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,220
He says at the end of the verse

572
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,820
that ye increase more and more,

573
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,940
but you notice that he commends them.

574
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,260
He acknowledges that they're doing this,

575
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,980
that they are loving the brethren,

576
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,360
that they are following the instruction that has been given.

577
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,660
We understand biblically as we could look

578
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,020
at a variety of passages in the book of John,

579
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,540
the book of 1 John, Peter deals with it,

580
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Paul deals with it in several of his epistles

581
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,100
that we're to love one another.

582
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,020
Jesus said by this, by our love one for another,

583
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,340
will all men know that we're his disciples.

584
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,180
And here Paul is saying to these believers in Thessalonica,

585
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,580
ye do it, and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren

586
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,120
which are in all Macedonia.

587
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,680
You're doing this, he's commending them.

588
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,640
And he challenges them, we beseech you, brethren,

589
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,960
that ye increase more and more.

590
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,000
And it's not that the commending

591
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,559
can't carry with it a challenge,

592
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,160
but you understand that it wasn't just a challenge.

593
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
Hey, you guys love each other.

594
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
No, you're doing this, he's acknowledging

595
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,160
and verbalizing, he's commending them.

596
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,360
Listen, there's some things that our children do

597
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,680
that are good things.

598
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,240
There's some things that as you're investing

599
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,040
in a growing believer,

600
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,800
You know, one of the things,

601
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,720
and I'll just use Bible reading as an example.

602
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,280
Sometimes when you're seeking to encourage and influence

603
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,520
and impart truth and model truth to a growing believer,

604
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,760
maybe they'll miss a day or several days

605
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,440
of reading the Bible.

606
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,820
You know what I found many times

607
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,520
in those types of situations?

608
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,500
They're upset with themselves for not reading the Bible.

609
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,680
I don't need to beat them up over not reading the Bible.

610
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,680
They're already kind of feeling the Holy Spirit conviction.

611
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,640
They need to be reading the Word of God.

612
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,000
And so I try to encourage them.

613
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,120
I try to give them some,

614
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,160
hey, listen, you just got to get back into it.

615
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,840
You got to, those days,

616
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
don't let days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months.

617
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,200
I mean, get back into it.

618
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Get back into the Word of God.

619
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,880
What can happen is we beat ourselves up, ourselves.

620
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,320
And then somebody comes along and beats us up some more.

621
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,800
Because we're not commending.

622
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,320
I believe it's important that we,

623
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,960
even as we look at Paul here in the book of 1 Thessalonians,

624
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,880
he takes some time to not only let these believers know

625
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,080
that he's praying for them, but he commends them.

626
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,160
Oh, he challenges them, no doubt, but he commends them.

627
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,880
He says, you're doing, you're examples.

628
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,800
You're doing these things.

629
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,040
What a blessing.

630
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,640
Number three, number five overall,

631
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,720
I would say this, invest in your children.

632
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
Invest in your children.

633
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,320
As we think about the Apostle Paul

634
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,640
and we think about the letter of 1 Thessalonians

635
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,000
and we think about the way in which he had given his life

636
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
to the Lord, to serve the Lord.

637
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,840
And of course it was here on the second missionary journey

638
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,320
in which Paul found himself in Thessalonica.

639
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,200
And then a number of years later,

640
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,480
he's writing this epistle to them.

641
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,000
But we find that Paul was seeking to invest in them.

642
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,400
We think about investing.

643
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
Oftentimes we think about the word invest.

644
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,880
We automatically in our minds think about monetary things,

645
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,840
investing, portfolios, so on and so forth.

646
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,280
But I'm talking about investing in people.

647
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm talking about investing in your children.

648
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm talking about this truth of a mature believer

649
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,640
and a growing believer, investing in them.

650
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,520
Do you know that if we're going to invest in our children,

651
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,920
if we're gonna invest in growing believers,

652
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,320
it's going to take time.

653
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,360
It's gonna take time.

654
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
It's not something that just, man, it just happens.

655
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,320
No, it's a process and it's time and it's engagement.

656
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,280
I would say this, not only is it gonna take time,

657
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,880
but it's something that we have to purpose to do.

658
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,240
That we have to purpose to do.

659
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,520
You know, I guess I'm at a stage in my life

660
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,960
where some of you have been and some of you will be.

661
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,360
It's just the way it works in life.

662
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,360
But I am more, I guess, aware at this moment in my life

663
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,600
of the truth that we have such a brief window of time

664
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
to invest in our children.

665
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,480
I mean, the window's so small.

666
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,760
Mr. Ed said to me this morning on his way out,

667
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,440
I can't, or actually we were over in the fellowship hall

668
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
during breakfast, he said, I just can't believe

669
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,320
Juliana's going to college this year.

670
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,000
Neither can I.

671
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,760
It's hard to believe.

672
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,680
And can I continue to invest in Juliana

673
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,760
after she goes to college?

674
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,360
Sure I can, but it's gonna be a whole lot different.

675
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,880
Can you invest in your adult children?

676
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,840
Sure you can.

677
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,200
It's a whole lot different, right?

678
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,920
And so what happens, it seems as if that quickly,

679
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,880
and you look and you say, man, my kids are,

680
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,200
whoo, where's the time gone?

681
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
How many of us have said that, right?

682
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,880
Where has the time gone?

683
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,440
And so what I'm saying is that you have to purpose

684
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,840
in investing, it takes time, but you have to purpose

685
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,760
to do it.

686
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,080
I understand sometimes, man, we're tired, we're drained,

687
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,680
we're pulled in all kinds of different directions.

688
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,400
But we have to invest in our children,

689
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,600
invest in a future generation, not only biologically,

690
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,240
but we invest in a future generation spiritually

691
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,200
when we think about this imparting truth

692
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
and modeling truth and thinking about a growing believer.

693
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,360
Notice, we've looked at the verse,

694
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,720
but I want you to see what he says

695
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,280
in 1 Thessalonians 3, in verse number 10.

696
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
In fact, if you look at verse number two,

697
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,680
it says this, that we sent Timotheus,

698
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,400
our brother and minister of God,

699
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,240
and he tells us why they sent Timothy.

700
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,440
It says this, our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ,

701
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,720
notice what he says, to establish you

702
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,760
and to comfort you concerning your faith.

703
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,520
Think about those two phrases, establish you, comfort you.

704
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
Those things take time.

705
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
To establish you and to comfort you.

706
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,000
Notice what he says, verse number 10,

707
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,240
night and day, praying exceedingly

708
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,120
that we may see your face,

709
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,720
and then notice what he says here,

710
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,720
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

711
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
I believe that as we look at verse number 10,

712
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,040
it's not really meant as an insult

713
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,360
as maybe some would receive it as,

714
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,680
but Paul is giving them truth and he's acknowledging,

715
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,800
listen, there's some things that are lacking in your faith.

716
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,400
If we would do an honest evaluation ourselves,

717
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,280
we'd say there's some things that are lacking in our faith.

718
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,840
We're not where we should be, perhaps.

719
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,260
We're not where we wanna be.

720
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,360
I hope that we're not in a place where we say,

721
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,920
well, I'm satisfied with where I am with my walk with God.

722
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,020
I hope we're never satisfied,

723
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,600
that we always wanna draw closer to him

724
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,680
and have greater communion with him,

725
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,280
and so Paul is saying that there are some things

726
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,180
that are lacking in your faith,

727
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,160
but he says, notice what he says in verse number 10,

728
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,160
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

729
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
That takes time.

730
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,280
You know what that is?

731
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,880
That's investing in someone.

732
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,920
We're going to invest in you to perfect that

733
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
which is lacking in your faith,

734
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,080
to come alongside someone, to edify them,

735
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,240
to encourage them, to teach them.

736
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,200
Again, this truth of what we looked at this morning,

737
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,480
to impart biblical truth,

738
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
listen, it takes time to teach somebody.

739
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,660
If you're going to be engaged in some level of discipleship,

740
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,660
if you're going to be engaged in giving of yourself

741
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,600
to be able to invest in someone else,

742
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,820
it's gonna require you to purpose to do so,

743
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,060
and you're going to have to make that investment of time.

744
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,820
I don't think Paul regretted it,

745
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,700
and I find that as we look at the context

746
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,740
and the application of our children

747
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,620
as a parent seeking to invest in your children,

748
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,860
isn't it exciting when your children begin to display

749
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,980
and to do the things that you've sought

750
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,380
to teach them to do?

751
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,740
I hear, I see some of these families in our church

752
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,820
with younger children,

753
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,020
and I see as they're going through the process of training

754
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,060
and trying to teach their kids,

755
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,700
and sometimes one of the little kids will say yes

756
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,020
as I ask him a question, and the parents say, yes, sir.

757
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,540
What are they doing?

758
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,180
They're consistently trying to teach them,

759
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,980
and then all of a sudden at some point,

760
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,420
the child's gonna say yes, sir,

761
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,980
and the parents say, they got it, hallelujah, right?

762
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,180
This morning, Camila, for whatever reason,

763
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,300
she didn't want to say good morning to me.

764
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't know, it was up early, whatever,

765
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,860
and I just kind of wanted to kind of let it pass,

766
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,940
and Mrs. Trejo wanted her to say good morning to me.

767
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,580
After the service, little Miss Camila comes up

768
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,820
and she says, good morning, Pastor Man.

769
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,880
It was so cute.

770
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,960
She didn't do that the first time, though,

771
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,160
and Deanna's talking Spanish to her

772
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,240
and trying to, I don't know what she's trying to do,

773
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,760
and I said, you can say good morning in Spanish, Camila,

774
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,080
but you understand what I'm saying.

775
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,280
We invest in people, and sometimes as we're investing

776
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
in people, we say, is it working?

777
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,680
Right, we can get frustrated,

778
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,960
but then when you start seeing it,

779
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,160
you see the fruit, you see the development,

780
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,200
you see the progress, how rewarding it is.

781
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,000
The parent-child relationship,

782
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,040
we think about this truth of investing

783
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,640
and we think of it biologically from that relationship,

784
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,200
but I want you to think about it spiritually

785
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,600
when you see some younger believers

786
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
that are growing in their walk with God,

787
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,960
that are maybe entering into a time of discussion with you

788
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,220
by sharing with you what God is doing in their life

789
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,700
and how God has answered prayer for them

790
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,180
this particular week and how they were reading

791
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,500
this portion of Scripture and God showed me this truth,

792
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,540
but as I was reading this portion of Scripture,

793
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,880
God showed me this, but then there was this thing over here

794
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,480
that I just didn't understand.

795
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,940
Most times, I'm stuck at I was reading my Bible

796
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,740
and I'm rejoicing, honestly,

797
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,260
and say, I just don't understand

798
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,600
exactly what God is saying here.

799
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,220
Can you help me?

800
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,460
Surely, but how encouraging it is

801
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,140
when you're investing in someone

802
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,940
and you're seeing that growth.

803
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,780
See, because ultimately, the goal,

804
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,400
as we've mentioned already,

805
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,100
as we've started this study this morning

806
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,000
and then this evening, the goal is clearly stated

807
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,340
in First Thessalonians 2.12,

808
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,860
that ye would walk worthy of God

809
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,860
who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

810
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,260
He repeats it in chapter four in verse number one,

811
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,100
furthermore then.

812
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,940
we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how

813
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:16,700
ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more." As we think about this

814
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:25,260
two-part message, I asked the question this morning, to whom are you imparting biblical truth?

815
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:33,900
To whom are you imparting biblical truth? Is there someone, maybe someones, several individuals,

816
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:41,740
that you can name, you can see their faces in your mind right now, that I'm imparting biblical

817
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:47,180
truth to these individuals? You know, in order to impart biblical truth, we need to know biblical

818
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:54,540
truth. I can't teach somebody something I don't know. Just can't do it. I've been asked several

819
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,300
times over the years by several different members a number of things, can you help me with this or

820
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,940
help me with that? There's some things that just fly, you don't want my help with. You got a

821
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,420
particular project at home, you need a car fixed and worked on, I can give you a name and a number,

822
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:17,420
but you don't want me working on it, you understand. But we think about if I have a knowledge,

823
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,300
if I'm going to impart biblical truth, I gotta know biblical truth. I gotta know the Word of God.

824
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,860
Somebody comes to you and says, hey I'm struggling in this area of my life,

825
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,340
do we have an answer that we can give them? Do we have some scripture that we can provide them

826
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:35,820
with to help them? To whom are we imparting biblical truth? How many people would observe

827
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:42,860
you, would see you and say, they're modeling biblical truth. Their behavior reveals what

828
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:49,340
they believe. To whom are we modeling biblical truth? And then this evening as we look at these

829
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:59,180
three thoughts, how's our prayer time? Intercessory prayer, praying for our children,

830
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:06,060
praying for growing believers, being aware of the battles in which they're facing, being aware of

831
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:17,340
the attacks of the enemy. Listen, He's seeking whom He may devour. Amen? And how are we going

832
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:26,300
to battle in prayer? Not only with the idea of praying for, but how are we doing with commending,

833
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:35,180
acknowledging some positives? It's easy to complain, is it not? You go to a restaurant,

834
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,940
you get poor service, man, it's easy to rattle off all the things that went wrong.

835
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,100
Sometimes you gotta work at trying to find something to be thankful for,

836
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:52,060
something to commend. But oh, that God would help us to have that spirit, that gentleness that Paul

837
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,660
speaks of in 1 Thessalonians 2, 7, and that we would commend. Listen, there's some good things,

838
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:06,220
there's some progress being made. And then that we would purpose to invest, to invest in a future

839
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:12,460
generation, not only our own children, but a future generation of church members. Listen,

840
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,900
at some point, this next generation that you see here, they're gonna be the pastors and the deacons

841
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,620
and the church leaders and the Sunday school teachers. It ain't gonna happen overnight,

842
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,220
just by one day. Well, there's nobody else here, so I guess I'll be the pastor.

843
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:33,260
It's not how it's gonna work. Some people are investing in, right? And so this evening,

844
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:41,180
as a father doth his children, I hope that we would be encouraged by the relationship that Paul

845
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,500
has with the believers at Thessalonica. But as we examine these five things, that we'd be

846
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,180
challenged, and we'd examine our own lives and say, are these principles, are these truths,

847
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:59,740
have they been incorporated in my life? How is it that I can incorporate these things in my life,

848
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:06,380
that I might fulfill the work that God has for me? Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

849
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,700
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. We thank you for

850
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,180
the truth that we've been able to examine throughout this day. Lord, I thank you for

851
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,300
decisions that have already been made, and then I think this evening of

852
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:30,220
your work in my heart and others, Lord, that you'd help us to be responsive. Lord, help us to

853
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:42,780
seek to influence a future generation, that they might walk worthy of God. Knowing that that will

854
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:50,540
not happen by chance, by accident, that there has to be a purposed engagement that we have

855
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:58,700
