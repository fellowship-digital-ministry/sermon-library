WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
And, of course, I mentioned this morning that the message was going to be a two-part message.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.920
This morning we looked at part number one, we examined a couple of principles.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.119
This evening we'll look at three additional truths from this book that I trust will be

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.920
a blessing to you.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.459
And the title was adopted from a phrase in verse number 11 of 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.399
And look at verse 10 with me and we'll get into the message.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.520
The Bible says in verse 10 of 1 Thessalonians 2,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.020
Ye are witnesses, and God also, how wholly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.479
among you that believe, as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:54.900
of you, then notice the phrase, as a father doth his children, that ye would walk worthy

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.740
of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.819
The phrase, of course, to end verse number 11 is the phrase that we've used for our title

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.959
this evening will be part two, as a father doth his children.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:14.459
And as we understand this book of 1 Thessalonians, just a brief overview this morning, we briefly

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:15.459
went through these things.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:20.419
Paul, of course, is writing to a church, a local body of believers, and he's writing

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:25.059
to this church as a church leader, and he's imparting truth to them, and he's seeking

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:26.660
to encourage them.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.580
And we find that the church in Thessalonica is a model church, it's a good church.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.180
And Paul is seeking to encourage them and instruct them.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.120
And we find that he uses this phrase, as a father doth his children, and as we looked

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.900
at that phrase and we understood as we would take the truths that we're looking at this

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.419
day, both this morning and tonight, that we would understand that we're looking at them

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:50.980
really from two perspectives.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.860
Number one is a father to a child, from a parent to a child, and the importance of that

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.260
relationship and the importance of following these principles.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.059
And then we looked at it from the perspective of dealing with a mature believer to a growing

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.059
believer.

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:15.699
The reality is that we have the opportunity to be engaged in influencing, discipling,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:22.059
imparting truth to those that we assemble with, to those that are younger in their walk

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.259
with Christ, that we would bring them along in their journey, and that we would impart

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.300
truth to them.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.940
The two principles that we discussed this morning, number one, impart biblical truth.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.699
The Apostle Paul, as he arrived, he and his team of missionaries, as they arrived into

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.020
the city of Thessalonica, we understand, the Bible tells us in Acts 17 and verse number

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.419
two, that they reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.500
And how important it is that we would impart biblical truth.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.160
We live in a society that can easily be described as being biblically ignorant.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.220
It's unfortunate, however, that there are those even sitting within quote-unquote churches

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.899
that are even biblically ignorant, because there's a lack of imparting of spiritual truth,

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:10.899
of biblical truth, and how important it is that we preach and teach the Word of God.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:16.339
We find that not only did we discuss the fact that it's imperative, you guys can come on

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.800
up, you're not going to disturb me, come on up, Trejos, if you want, that's not a problem.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.179
And Mr. Armando got a new toy today, and so I'm not sure if that's the reason for the

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:32.059
delay or not, but I understand if you need your grass cut, just contact Brother Armando,

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.179
and man, he's got a new riding mower and he's all excited about it, amen?

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.179
Is that right?

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.179
Am I pretty accurate?

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:39.179
Amen.

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.179
Yeah, amen!

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.419
He cut his grass two times today.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.460
Now back to the message, sorry for the interruption, amen?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.419
Back to the message, we find that we're to impart biblical truth, but then we talked

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:55.220
about the importance of modeling biblical truth, that we are to model biblical truth,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.779
that we are to live.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:02.839
Remember the truth that the message of our life is far more impactful than the message

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:08.580
of our lips, and the reality is that the message of our life ought to agree with the message

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.380
of our lips.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.220
Do you teach not to steal, but you steal?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.979
Remember Romans chapter number two.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.980
And so obviously we understand that we need to be imparting biblical truth, but then we

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.359
need to model biblical truth.

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:28.720
Someone that's watching you, someone that's observing you, are they seeing in you that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.200
you're living out the biblical truth that you claim to believe?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.399
I've often said this over the years, that belief impacts behavior.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:40.700
I believe that.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.799
What you believe impacts how you behave.

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:50.679
But I also believe that behavior reveals belief.

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.320
How you behave reveals what you believe.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.519
And the reality this evening, as we look this morning quite extensively, we need to impart

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:02.359
biblical truth and we need to model biblical truth.

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.959
And again, the whole goal that we're working towards, not only through those two truths,

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:11.720
but the three that we'll look at this evening, is the goal that is mentioned in verse number

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:21.600
12, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.959
You know, the greatest desire, I understand as parents, God's given Holly and I the opportunity

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:32.079
to have three children, and what a blessing children are.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:37.079
And I understand as parents that we have desires for our children and we have goals and desires

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:41.279
that they would be successful and so on and so forth.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.359
But you know, the greatest desire we ought to have as Christian parents is that our children

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.040
would walk worthy of God.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.959
That our children would live a life that is pleasing to God Almighty.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:00.119
Because if they're living a life that is pleasing to God Almighty, I'm going to say that they're

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.339
living a life that would be pleasing in your sight as well, amen?

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:08.399
And so this evening, as we have that goal in mind and look at this second part, notice

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.760
with me tonight, number one this evening, number three of the truths that we're looking

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.000
at, pray for your children.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.799
This is real practical tonight.

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:19.760
We dealt with, in part, biblical truth, model biblical truth.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.679
This evening, think about this, pray for your children.

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:25.279
Pray for your children.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.559
You know, it's interesting as you study the Word of God, in particular studying the New

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:33.640
Testament, reading and studying the books that God used the Apostle Paul to pen from

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.559
a human perspective, it is of note to study those books and to see how often Paul tells

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.880
those believers, I'm praying for you.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.279
I'm praying for you.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:50.959
And it's of interest that not only in many cases, he not only just says, I'm praying

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.679
for you, but he tells them how he's praying for them.

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.779
And how impactful that is.

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.920
Not only do we see that Paul would communicate to those that he's ministering to that he's

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.239
praying for them, but we find that Paul then also would request prayer for himself.

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:12.320
He would request, even as we looked this morning at 1 Thessalonians 5, brethren, pray for us.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320
Simple request.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.839
But, you know, prayer is a unique privilege that we have as the people of God.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:23.600
That we can enter into the throne room of heaven, that we can have confidence that our

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.559
God hears us, we understand the wonderful promises that God has given us, that He is

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:32.519
going to answer us, that He's able to answer.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.119
He's able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:42.119
He said to Jeremiah, call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:45.279
things which thou knowest not.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:53.359
The reality is that prayer reveals our dependence upon God.

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:55.880
Miss Joyce gave me a little poem this morning.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.359
She handed it to me and said, Happy Father's Day.

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:04.279
And it says this, the title of the poem from a man by the name of Frank Jones, I heard

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.160
my father pray.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.640
My hand was on the doorknob for the door was closed that day.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.519
I wondered who had closed it.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:23.920
Then I heard my father say, Oh Lord, bless my children and help me day by day to be the

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.000
kind of father that will never want to stray.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.400
My heart was overflowing as I heard your pleas that day.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.200
Those moments were so precious for I heard my father pray.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.760
My hand slipped from the doorknob.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.640
I quietly went and prayed.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.760
I asked God to send more fathers who will close the door and pray.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.039
Oh, that we'd pray for our children.

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:56.239
As I think about this truth of praying for our children, notice in 1 Thessalonians how

00:08:56.239 --> 00:09:00.520
Paul is praying for these that God would give him the opportunity to minister to.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.719
In 1 Thessalonians 1, notice in verse number 2, notice what Paul says.

00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:11.400
Right in the introduction, we give thanks to God always for you all, making mention

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.640
of you in our prayers.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640
Paul says, I'm praying for you.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.500
I'm making mention of you in our prayers.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.859
In chapter number 2, notice as you continue to go through the passage of scripture, we

00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:33.820
find that Paul is giving to them the truth that he is seeking as he's praying for them.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.580
He's seeking to give them this truth that they were allowed of God, but they're praying

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.500
and he's gentle among them and he's giving them truth.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.020
It says in verse number 9, for you remember brethren, our labor and travail for laboring

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.419
night and day because we would not be chargeable to any of you.

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:54.299
We preached unto you the gospel of God.

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:58.700
We understand that he's saying there that we're laboring and travailing and you think

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.940
about the labor and

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.860
the travail of prayer.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.240
We understand that no doubt

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.580
v. 9 could communicate to us

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.260
a number of aspects of the labor and travail,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.880
but you understand this evening

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.660
that prayer is labor?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.500
Prayers work.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.940
You travail in prayer.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.940
You labor in prayer.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.080
And we find that Paul is saying

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.180
to these believers,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.340
listen, we're praying for you.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.680
And we are praying because we understand

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.560
that God hears and answers prayer.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.200
Look at v. 20 of chapter 2.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.020
The Bible says,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.720
for you are our glory and joy.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.240
I think about Paul making this statement

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.560
and giving to these believers this truth

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.640
with regard to the fact

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.200
that they held a special part in his heart.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.040
And it reminds me of what Paul says

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.480
to the believers in Philippi.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.680
Hold your place here

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.560
and turn to Philippians 1, if you will.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.400
Look at Philippians 1.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.920
And notice what Paul is saying

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.520
to these believers in Philippi.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.840
He says this in v. 3,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.440
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.920
always in every prayer of mine

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.200
for you all making request with joy.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.840
Notice v. 7.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.920
Even as it is for me to think this of you all,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.600
notice, because I have you in my heart.

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.720
And as much as both in my bonds

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.600
and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.200
ye all are partakers of my grace.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.760
For God is my record.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.880
How greatly I long after you all

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.680
in the bowels of Jesus Christ.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.800
And this I pray,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.360
that your love may abound yet more and more

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.680
in knowledge and in all judgment,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.880
that you may approve things that are excellent,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.840
that you may be sincere and without offense

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.279
till the day of Christ,

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.560
being filled with the fruits of righteousness

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.480
which are by Jesus Christ

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.720
unto the glory and praise of God.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.720
And here, as he's writing to the believers in Thessalonica,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.360
he says to them that ye are our glory and joy.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.040
Just as the believers in Philippi

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.559
were on the heart of the Apostle Paul,

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:14.600
these believers in Thessalonica were on the heart of Paul.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.520
And no doubt, because they were,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.400
as he would refer to them as being his glory and joy,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.919
no doubt he's praying for them.

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:22.800
He's mindful.

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:25.199
You know, when you have somebody on your heart,

00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:28.119
it's easy to have them in your prayers.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.720
They're on your heart.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.119
And we find here that Paul is seeking

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:36.440
to encourage these believers

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.160
by letting them know that he's praying for them.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.720
Notice in chapter number three in verse number 10,

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:44.199
notice the phraseology that he uses.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.800
Night and day, praying exceedingly,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.919
that we might see your face and might perfect that

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:54.639
which is lacking in your faith.

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:57.880
We understand that Paul had a desire to go to visit them.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.360
He says that in verse number 18 of chapter two,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.040
wherefore, we would have come unto you,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.520
even I, Paul, once and again, but Satan hindered us.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.080
And then he talks about night and day,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.360
praying exceedingly that we might see your face.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.400
And again, the encouragement that one receives

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.199
when they understand that someone is praying for them.

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:18.040
You know, who better to pray for your children than you?

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:23.479
When we think about it from that application

00:13:23.479 --> 00:13:26.119
of a parent to a child, we see that,

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:28.160
but think about it even from the application

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.279
of a mature believer seeking to influence

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.960
a growing believer.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.600
You know, when you're imparting truth

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.199
and modeling truth to a growing believer,

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:40.559
and you're engaged in prayer for that believer,

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.839
that you're praying that God would help them

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:46.760
to grasp the particular truths in which you're dealing with

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.440
and maybe the obstacles and the difficulties

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.360
in which they're dealing with,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.400
because there are some things that you know

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.199
about their walk and where they are in their journey

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:57.639
and what's going on, because the reality is

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:00.680
that you're in a place where, through that discipleship

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.680
and through imparting and modeling biblical truth to them,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.119
they may open up to you and they may share some things

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.600
with you of some difficulties, some challenges

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.160
that they're experiencing, and you then can go to God

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.199
on their behalf and intercede for them.

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.360
Because you know some things that are going on

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.519
that someone else may not know.

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:25.040
When we think about the ministry of intercessory prayer,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.720
we understand that it requires knowledge.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.760
How is it that we can pray one for another?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.440
I'm not suggesting that we need to know

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720
every single thing about someone,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.559
but as you know some things that are going on

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:40.279
in the life of an individual,

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.640
as you know some things are going on

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.880
in the lives of your children,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.720
then you can better intercede on their behalf.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.320
Think about this in chapter number three

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.760
of 1 Thessalonians, when we think about this truth

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.880
of praying for your children, I believe that it's important

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.860
that we recognize the battles that they face.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.679
I know that there are times that I have said to my children

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.119
when something's going on in a particular stage

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:07.940
or some difficulty, and I might make a comment

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.920
something like this, I've been 16 before,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.040
you know, I understand, I've been there,

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:15.440
I know what you're going through sort of thing.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.160
When we look at what Paul is saying

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.200
in 1 Thessalonians three in the first eight verses,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.720
and it helps us to understand the battles

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.119
that these individuals were facing.

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.040
Remember, as we discussed this morning,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.839
Paul said that he gave them truth,

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.959
even though they were shamefully entreated,

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:35.600
even though they dealt with much contention and opposition,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.880
he imparted truth to these believers.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.440
But then notice what he says beginning in verse number one

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.760
of 1 Thessalonians three.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.959
Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:49.220
we thought it good to be left at Athens alone,

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.119
and sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.959
and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:59.959
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.279
that no man should be moved by these afflictions,

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:08.519
for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.559
For verily, when we were with you,

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:14.440
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.760
even as it came to pass,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.320
and ye know for this cause when I could no longer forbear,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.320
I sent to know your faith,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.980
lest by some means the tempter have tempted you

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.320
and our labor be in vain.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.440
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.679
and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity,

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:37.779
and that you have good remembrance of us,

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:42.779
always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:46.459
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:49.380
in all our affliction and distress by your faith,

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.839
for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.739
But I want you to notice specifically,

00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:54.980
he talks about verse number three,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.140
that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.860
He says, furthermore, that ye yourselves know

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.339
that we are appointed thereunto.

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:05.619
He says in verse number four, even we should suffer,

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.399
or excuse me, we told you before

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.720
that we should suffer tribulation.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.880
He says in verse number five, that lest by some means

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.239
the tempter have tempted you and our labor be in vain.

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:21.640
I mean, when we understand the battles that someone faces,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.399
it will lead us to prayer.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.059
That we're going and engaging in intercessory prayer

00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:31.880
on the behalf of our children,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.720
on behalf of those growing believers

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.519
that we are influencing and impacting,

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:40.679
that we're imparting biblical truth to them.

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:43.480
Listen, there are some battles that your children face.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.440
Amen?

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.200
Listen, I understand some of the battles

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.000
that your children face are the same types of battles

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.519
that we faced, but some of the battles that they face

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:54.580
are quite different than the battles that we faced.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.519
You know, sin has always been sin,

00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:59.880
and the devil has no new tricks,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.679
but can I tell you that the access to wickedness

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.760
is so much greater today than it's ever been?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.080
Honestly.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.399
You know, I don't know what the percentage is.

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:12.600
I'm sure you could do a quick Google search and find out,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.040
but you know how many people are walking around

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.959
with these smartphones?

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:18.839
I mean, wickedness, if you're not careful,

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:23.200
it's accessible in a click, right?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.360
Oh man, that we'd pray for our children,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.640
that we'd understand that as we're seeking.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.279
You say, I don't have any children at home.

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.600
I understand, that's wonderful,

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.159
but what about the believer that's growing

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:37.080
that you're seeking to influence and impart truth to them

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.280
and model truth to them?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.159
Listen, they're facing some attacks from the enemy,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.320
and if you understand that and you're aware

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.320
of the way in which they're being attacked,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.520
it would lead us to a place of praying

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.260
more fervently for them.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.080
It's a simple truth, but oh,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.599
how we need to pray for our children.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.159
We'd pray for them.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.640
I mean, just make it a priority in our lives

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.320
that we spend a season of prayer for our children.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.720
You know, God answers prayer,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.080
and God works through the ministry of prayer

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.059
in ways that we can't even fully comprehend.

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:24.840
See, God's always at work, and as we pray,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.640
and God is able to do what only God can do.

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:30.000
Oh, that we'd pray.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.840
Number two, not only that we'd pray for our children,

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.299
number two this evening, number four,

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:35.320
if you're looking at all of the truths,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.919
but I want you to think about this.

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:39.260
Commend your children.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.099
Commend them.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.320
You know, I believe that it's important

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.640
that we acknowledge and verbalize.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.559
I believe that as we look at Paul here

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.960
and looking at this truth from 1 Thessalonians

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.320
and looking at his behavior with these individual believers

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:58.479
and his interaction with them, he's commending them,

00:19:58.479 --> 00:19:59.840
and the reality.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.600
this evening is that, yes, He's challenging them,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.680
He's seeking to push them along in their walk with God,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.460
but He's commending the progress that they've made.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.180
And I believe that sometimes in our lives,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.700
and I'll speak for myself very personally,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.820
I believe one of the pitfalls for me personally

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.980
is to point out weaknesses or failures

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.620
without acknowledging strengths and accomplishments.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.340
It's a lot easier for us to say,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.200
man, your room's dirty, what are you doing?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.640
Than to say, hey, I walked by your room

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.800
and it looks really good.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.940
I walk by the room and it looks really good,

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.780
I don't even think about it,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.140
I just keep on going through my day,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.580
and you understand what I'm saying?

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.320
And so we have to be aware of this,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.600
and we need to acknowledge and verbalize,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.460
and when we see that growth, when we see that progress,

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.280
when we see some development, we commend.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.020
Notice what he says here, back to chapter number one,

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.360
notice in verse number three,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.020
Paul mentioned in verse number two

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.300
how that he was praying for them

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.980
and he was thanking God for them.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.620
He says then in verse number three,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.900
remembering without ceasing,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.100
notice what he remembers,

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.360
your work of faith, your labor of love,

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.900
and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.820
in the sight of God and our Father.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.860
I believe that Paul, as he's noting here

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.460
in verse number three, he's remembering some things,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.000
he's remembering and he's acknowledging

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.460
and he's verbalizing here some things

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.300
that they were doing.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.140
They had a work of faith.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.540
They believed that God was able,

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.400
listen, the Bible says in verse number eight,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.220
that from you, verse seven,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.440
so that you were in samples

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.800
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.640
You know what Paul's saying?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.220
You're an example.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.500
You got it, we gave you truth,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.940
we imparted truth to you, and you embraced it,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.480
you received it, remember,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.820
in chapter number two he says you received it

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.000
not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.520
the word of God which effectually worketh

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.320
also in you that believe,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.800
and he says you were in samples,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.880
and then he goes on to say in verse number eight,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.360
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.440
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.720
but also in every place your faith to God

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.040
were to spread abroad,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.360
so that we need not to speak anything.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.520
As I look at 1 Thessalonians 1.8,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.360
you know what Paul is saying in verse 7 and 8?

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.940
He's saying, listen, you're being an example.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.060
You're doing the work of the ministry,

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.600
your work of faith, your labor of love.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.180
In just a little while we'll look at another verse

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.860
where he talks about them loving one another

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.160
as they're supposed to,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.740
but you'll find that Paul is commending them,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.880
he's acknowledging what they're doing.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.780
Listen, it's easy to say,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.580
man, you're not doing this, and you're not doing this,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.060
and you're not doing this, and you're not doing this,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.900
and you gotta do this.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.580
It's easy for us to do that.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.080
And sometimes what happens in the life of a child

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.720
is they just sit back and say,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.240
can I do anything right?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.480
I mean, what's the point?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.960
Every time I turn around,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.400
I'm being told I'm not doing this,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400
and I'm not doing that,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.120
and I need to do better with this.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.200
You understand what I'm saying?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.440
But as believers, sometimes we can fall in the same trap.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.000
Where it's just that this truth of,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.640
look, we're looking at the truth of God,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.900
this truth of, look, we're looking at

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.220
not only parent to child,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.100
but from a mature believer to a growing believer.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.900
Listen, someone had grace and patience with you

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.780
when you were growing, hopefully.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.720
And if not, you probably wouldn't be where you are today.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.160
I'm glad that some people had some patience with me.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.060
You understand?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.100
Because you didn't always do everything right

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.540
right after you got saved, and neither did I.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.960
There's a work that God's doing in our lives.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.120
We sing the song that God's still working on me

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.520
to make me what I ought to be.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.080
I mean, listen, He created everything in just six days.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.720
And that's part of that song.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.360
And I mean, you read Genesis chapter one, it's amazing,

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.480
but He's still working on me.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.120
Listen, sometimes you're investing

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.440
in the life of a baby Christian, of a growing believer,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.440
and sometimes they just mess up.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.080
What do you do?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.600
How do you respond?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.560
How do you bring them along?

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.840
How do you work through that?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.880
We're sitting last Sunday night, we had a fellowship,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.080
and Blake and Vanessa were sitting there,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.200
and they had just gotten back from their vacation,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.520
and I purposed to sit with them,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.820
find out how things were going.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.880
And man, little Ethan was just,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.360
he was just spitting up all over the place.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.800
And Vanessa, at one point, finally, she was like,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.940
Blake, we just gotta go.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.460
I mean, it was just, it was all over her.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.860
He's a baby.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.580
That's what he does, right?

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.100
I mean, you're not gonna get mad at the kid.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.500
You're not gonna dispose of him.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.180
No, he's a baby.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.820
She wasn't mad at Ethan.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.620
It was just time to go,

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.420
because she wanted to get her clothes changed.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.300
You understand, right?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.500
And so she walked in this morning,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.100
and just in the humorous way in which she could,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.940
because I shared with her how that Brianna,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.280
she used to spit up like crazy when she was a baby.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.520
And so I never held Brianna on a Sunday.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.360
I just didn't.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360
When I had a suit on, I wasn't holding her.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.440
And so Vanessa walks in this morning, Blake,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.720
and she says, Pastor Chris, you wanna hold Ethan?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.320
And I'm like, you're so funny, you know?

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.440
No, I don't wanna hold that kid, man.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.560
I mean, I do, but just not right now,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.400
you know what I mean?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.240
But listen, we understand this in life.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.720
Listen, sometimes even a mature believer

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.420
just fails, just messes up.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.020
It's interesting to me, you know the account

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.380
after the first missionary journey,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.740
really partway through the first missionary journey,

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.100
John forsook, right?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.100
He left, and whatever happened, and so on and so forth,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.940
and we find that it was a difficulty

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.900
that caused some division and caused some problems there

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.940
with, John Mark, it was, with the situation

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.420
between Paul and Barnabas.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.420
But you know, Paul, before his death,

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.300
he said this in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 11,

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.980
take Mark and bring him with thee,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.760
for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.480
I understand it caused some division.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.600
You can read of it in Acts with Paul and Barnabas

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.860
and Mark, John Mark, and all that happened,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.260
but eventually there was a time in Paul's life

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.140
where he said, listen, Mark is profitable

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.500
to me for the ministry.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.760
He's grown, he's matured.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.500
If someone was blind and they walked into you,

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.500
they bumped into you, you probably wouldn't

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.720
be real mad at them.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.740
They're blind.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.980
And we think about this truth of commending our children

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.580
and seeking to influence them and encourage them

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.180
and to acknowledge some things that they do that are right,

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.020
and even though there's gonna be some mess-ups,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.020
I'm not suggesting that we don't correct them.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.340
Please understand what I'm saying this evening.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.260
We understand that we need to correct

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.820
and we need to reprove and rebuke,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.900
and it's part of all of the package,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.540
but sometimes what I'm simply saying is it's easier

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.040
to reprove and rebuke than it is to commend.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.260
Sometimes it's just, man, it's in our wheelhouse

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.880
to just reprove and rebuke.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.080
But commending is a different story.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.540
Notice what Paul says in chapter two of 1 Thessalonians

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.260
in verse number seven.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.940
We referenced this verse this morning,

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.900
but notice here he says this,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.540
but we were gentle among you,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.360
even as a nurse cherisheth her children.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.200
Gentle.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.060
Gentle.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.500
We notice in chapter number four,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.800
Paul again would commend these believers in Thessalonica.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.440
He says this in verse number nine

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.360
of 1 Thessalonians four,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.660
but as touching brotherly love,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800
ye need not that I write unto you.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.760
For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.360
Notice this, verse 10,

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.960
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.620
which are in all Macedonia.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.800
But we beseech you, brethren,

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.059
that ye increase more and more.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.620
Commending them and acknowledging and verbalizing

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.980
that they were loving one another

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.220
did not prevent him, Paul,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.100
from encouraging them to continue to grow in that manner.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.220
He says at the end of the verse

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.820
that ye increase more and more,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.940
but you notice that he commends them.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.260
He acknowledges that they're doing this,

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.980
that they are loving the brethren,

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.360
that they are following the instruction that has been given.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.660
We understand biblically as we could look

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.020
at a variety of passages in the book of John,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.540
the book of 1 John, Peter deals with it,

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.540
Paul deals with it in several of his epistles

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.100
that we're to love one another.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.020
Jesus said by this, by our love one for another,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.340
will all men know that we're his disciples.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.180
And here Paul is saying to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.580
ye do it, and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.120
which are in all Macedonia.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.680
You're doing this, he's commending them.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.640
And he challenges them, we beseech you, brethren,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.960
that ye increase more and more.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.000
And it's not that the commending

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.559
can't carry with it a challenge,

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:40.160
but you understand that it wasn't just a challenge.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.080
Hey, you guys love each other.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.080
No, you're doing this, he's acknowledging

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.160
and verbalizing, he's commending them.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.360
Listen, there's some things that our children do

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.680
that are good things.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.240
There's some things that as you're investing

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.040
in a growing believer,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.800
You know, one of the things,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.720
and I'll just use Bible reading as an example.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.280
Sometimes when you're seeking to encourage and influence

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.520
and impart truth and model truth to a growing believer,

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.760
maybe they'll miss a day or several days

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.440
of reading the Bible.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.820
You know what I found many times

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.520
in those types of situations?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.500
They're upset with themselves for not reading the Bible.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.680
I don't need to beat them up over not reading the Bible.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.680
They're already kind of feeling the Holy Spirit conviction.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.640
They need to be reading the Word of God.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.000
And so I try to encourage them.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.120
I try to give them some,

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.160
hey, listen, you just got to get back into it.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.840
You got to, those days,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.640
don't let days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.200
I mean, get back into it.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.400
Get back into the Word of God.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.880
What can happen is we beat ourselves up, ourselves.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.320
And then somebody comes along and beats us up some more.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.800
Because we're not commending.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.320
I believe it's important that we,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.960
even as we look at Paul here in the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.880
he takes some time to not only let these believers know

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.080
that he's praying for them, but he commends them.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.160
Oh, he challenges them, no doubt, but he commends them.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.880
He says, you're doing, you're examples.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.800
You're doing these things.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.040
What a blessing.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.640
Number three, number five overall,

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.720
I would say this, invest in your children.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.680
Invest in your children.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.320
As we think about the Apostle Paul

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.640
and we think about the letter of 1 Thessalonians

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.000
and we think about the way in which he had given his life

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.600
to the Lord, to serve the Lord.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.840
And of course it was here on the second missionary journey

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.320
in which Paul found himself in Thessalonica.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.200
And then a number of years later,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.480
he's writing this epistle to them.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.000
But we find that Paul was seeking to invest in them.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.400
We think about investing.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.560
Oftentimes we think about the word invest.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.880
We automatically in our minds think about monetary things,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.840
investing, portfolios, so on and so forth.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.280
But I'm talking about investing in people.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.960
I'm talking about investing in your children.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.000
I'm talking about this truth of a mature believer

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.640
and a growing believer, investing in them.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.520
Do you know that if we're going to invest in our children,

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.920
if we're gonna invest in growing believers,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.320
it's going to take time.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.360
It's gonna take time.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.480
It's not something that just, man, it just happens.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.320
No, it's a process and it's time and it's engagement.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.280
I would say this, not only is it gonna take time,

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.880
but it's something that we have to purpose to do.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.240
That we have to purpose to do.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.520
You know, I guess I'm at a stage in my life

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.960
where some of you have been and some of you will be.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.360
It's just the way it works in life.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.360
But I am more, I guess, aware at this moment in my life

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.600
of the truth that we have such a brief window of time

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.240
to invest in our children.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.480
I mean, the window's so small.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.760
Mr. Ed said to me this morning on his way out,

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.440
I can't, or actually we were over in the fellowship hall

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.360
during breakfast, he said, I just can't believe

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.320
Juliana's going to college this year.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.000
Neither can I.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.760
It's hard to believe.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.680
And can I continue to invest in Juliana

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.760
after she goes to college?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.360
Sure I can, but it's gonna be a whole lot different.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.880
Can you invest in your adult children?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.840
Sure you can.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.200
It's a whole lot different, right?

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.920
And so what happens, it seems as if that quickly,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.880
and you look and you say, man, my kids are,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.200
whoo, where's the time gone?

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.600
How many of us have said that, right?

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.880
Where has the time gone?

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.440
And so what I'm saying is that you have to purpose

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.840
in investing, it takes time, but you have to purpose

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.760
to do it.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.080
I understand sometimes, man, we're tired, we're drained,

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.680
we're pulled in all kinds of different directions.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.400
But we have to invest in our children,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.600
invest in a future generation, not only biologically,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.240
but we invest in a future generation spiritually

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.200
when we think about this imparting truth

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.200
and modeling truth and thinking about a growing believer.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.360
Notice, we've looked at the verse,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.720
but I want you to see what he says

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.280
in 1 Thessalonians 3, in verse number 10.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.200
In fact, if you look at verse number two,

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.680
it says this, that we sent Timotheus,

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.400
our brother and minister of God,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.240
and he tells us why they sent Timothy.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.440
It says this, our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.720
notice what he says, to establish you

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.760
and to comfort you concerning your faith.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.520
Think about those two phrases, establish you, comfort you.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.720
Those things take time.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.880
To establish you and to comfort you.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.000
Notice what he says, verse number 10,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.240
night and day, praying exceedingly

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.120
that we may see your face,

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.720
and then notice what he says here,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.720
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.920
I believe that as we look at verse number 10,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.040
it's not really meant as an insult

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.360
as maybe some would receive it as,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.680
but Paul is giving them truth and he's acknowledging,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.800
listen, there's some things that are lacking in your faith.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.400
If we would do an honest evaluation ourselves,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.280
we'd say there's some things that are lacking in our faith.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.840
We're not where we should be, perhaps.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.260
We're not where we wanna be.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.360
I hope that we're not in a place where we say,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.920
well, I'm satisfied with where I am with my walk with God.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.020
I hope we're never satisfied,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.600
that we always wanna draw closer to him

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.680
and have greater communion with him,

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.280
and so Paul is saying that there are some things

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.180
that are lacking in your faith,

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.160
but he says, notice what he says in verse number 10,

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.160
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.440
That takes time.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.280
You know what that is?

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.880
That's investing in someone.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.920
We're going to invest in you to perfect that

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.440
which is lacking in your faith,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.080
to come alongside someone, to edify them,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.240
to encourage them, to teach them.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.200
Again, this truth of what we looked at this morning,

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.480
to impart biblical truth,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.640
listen, it takes time to teach somebody.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.660
If you're going to be engaged in some level of discipleship,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.660
if you're going to be engaged in giving of yourself

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.600
to be able to invest in someone else,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.820
it's gonna require you to purpose to do so,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.060
and you're going to have to make that investment of time.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.820
I don't think Paul regretted it,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.700
and I find that as we look at the context

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.740
and the application of our children

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.620
as a parent seeking to invest in your children,

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.860
isn't it exciting when your children begin to display

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.980
and to do the things that you've sought

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.380
to teach them to do?

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.740
I hear, I see some of these families in our church

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.820
with younger children,

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.020
and I see as they're going through the process of training

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.060
and trying to teach their kids,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.700
and sometimes one of the little kids will say yes

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.020
as I ask him a question, and the parents say, yes, sir.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.540
What are they doing?

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.180
They're consistently trying to teach them,

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.980
and then all of a sudden at some point,

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.420
the child's gonna say yes, sir,

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.980
and the parents say, they got it, hallelujah, right?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.180
This morning, Camila, for whatever reason,

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.300
she didn't want to say good morning to me.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.600
I don't know, it was up early, whatever,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.860
and I just kind of wanted to kind of let it pass,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.940
and Mrs. Trejo wanted her to say good morning to me.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.580
After the service, little Miss Camila comes up

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.820
and she says, good morning, Pastor Man.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.880
It was so cute.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.960
She didn't do that the first time, though,

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.160
and Deanna's talking Spanish to her

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.240
and trying to, I don't know what she's trying to do,

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.760
and I said, you can say good morning in Spanish, Camila,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.080
but you understand what I'm saying.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.280
We invest in people, and sometimes as we're investing

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.880
in people, we say, is it working?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.680
Right, we can get frustrated,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.960
but then when you start seeing it,

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.160
you see the fruit, you see the development,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.200
you see the progress, how rewarding it is.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.000
The parent-child relationship,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.040
we think about this truth of investing

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.640
and we think of it biologically from that relationship,

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.200
but I want you to think about it spiritually

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.600
when you see some younger believers

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.600
that are growing in their walk with God,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.960
that are maybe entering into a time of discussion with you

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.220
by sharing with you what God is doing in their life

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.700
and how God has answered prayer for them

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.180
this particular week and how they were reading

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.500
this portion of Scripture and God showed me this truth,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.540
but as I was reading this portion of Scripture,

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.880
God showed me this, but then there was this thing over here

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.480
that I just didn't understand.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.940
Most times, I'm stuck at I was reading my Bible

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.740
and I'm rejoicing, honestly,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.260
and say, I just don't understand

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.600
exactly what God is saying here.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.220
Can you help me?

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.460
Surely, but how encouraging it is

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.140
when you're investing in someone

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.940
and you're seeing that growth.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.780
See, because ultimately, the goal,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.400
as we've mentioned already,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.100
as we've started this study this morning

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.000
and then this evening, the goal is clearly stated

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.340
in First Thessalonians 2.12,

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.860
that ye would walk worthy of God

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.860
who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.260
He repeats it in chapter four in verse number one,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.100
furthermore then.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.940
we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:16.700
ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more." As we think about this

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:25.260
two-part message, I asked the question this morning, to whom are you imparting biblical truth?

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:33.900
To whom are you imparting biblical truth? Is there someone, maybe someones, several individuals,

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:41.740
that you can name, you can see their faces in your mind right now, that I'm imparting biblical

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.180
truth to these individuals? You know, in order to impart biblical truth, we need to know biblical

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:54.540
truth. I can't teach somebody something I don't know. Just can't do it. I've been asked several

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.300
times over the years by several different members a number of things, can you help me with this or

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.940
help me with that? There's some things that just fly, you don't want my help with. You got a

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.420
particular project at home, you need a car fixed and worked on, I can give you a name and a number,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:17.420
but you don't want me working on it, you understand. But we think about if I have a knowledge,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.300
if I'm going to impart biblical truth, I gotta know biblical truth. I gotta know the Word of God.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.860
Somebody comes to you and says, hey I'm struggling in this area of my life,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.340
do we have an answer that we can give them? Do we have some scripture that we can provide them

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:35.820
with to help them? To whom are we imparting biblical truth? How many people would observe

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:42.860
you, would see you and say, they're modeling biblical truth. Their behavior reveals what

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:49.340
they believe. To whom are we modeling biblical truth? And then this evening as we look at these

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:59.180
three thoughts, how's our prayer time? Intercessory prayer, praying for our children,

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:06.060
praying for growing believers, being aware of the battles in which they're facing, being aware of

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:17.340
the attacks of the enemy. Listen, He's seeking whom He may devour. Amen? And how are we going

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:26.300
to battle in prayer? Not only with the idea of praying for, but how are we doing with commending,

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:35.180
acknowledging some positives? It's easy to complain, is it not? You go to a restaurant,

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.940
you get poor service, man, it's easy to rattle off all the things that went wrong.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.100
Sometimes you gotta work at trying to find something to be thankful for,

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:52.060
something to commend. But oh, that God would help us to have that spirit, that gentleness that Paul

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.660
speaks of in 1 Thessalonians 2, 7, and that we would commend. Listen, there's some good things,

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:06.220
there's some progress being made. And then that we would purpose to invest, to invest in a future

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:12.460
generation, not only our own children, but a future generation of church members. Listen,

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:17.900
at some point, this next generation that you see here, they're gonna be the pastors and the deacons

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.620
and the church leaders and the Sunday school teachers. It ain't gonna happen overnight,

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.220
just by one day. Well, there's nobody else here, so I guess I'll be the pastor.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:33.260
It's not how it's gonna work. Some people are investing in, right? And so this evening,

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:41.180
as a father doth his children, I hope that we would be encouraged by the relationship that Paul

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.500
has with the believers at Thessalonica. But as we examine these five things, that we'd be

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:51.180
challenged, and we'd examine our own lives and say, are these principles, are these truths,

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:59.740
have they been incorporated in my life? How is it that I can incorporate these things in my life,

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:06.380
that I might fulfill the work that God has for me? Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.700
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. We thank you for

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:17.180
the truth that we've been able to examine throughout this day. Lord, I thank you for

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.300
decisions that have already been made, and then I think this evening of

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:30.220
your work in my heart and others, Lord, that you'd help us to be responsive. Lord, help us to

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:42.780
seek to influence a future generation, that they might walk worthy of God. Knowing that that will

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:50.540
not happen by chance, by accident, that there has to be a purposed engagement that we have

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:58.700
in their lives, that they might come to that place of walking worthy. I pray that you'd help us

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.540
guide us and direct us, and we'll thank you for it. Would you stand?
