1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
1 Timothy chapter number five.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,119
Many of you know that we've been studying

3
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:05,559
through the book of 1 Timothy here on Sunday mornings

4
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,359
for the calendar year of 2024.

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,520
And once we're finished with 1 Timothy,

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,159
we'll go right into 2 Timothy.

7
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,640
Our theme for this year is continue.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,360
And we see that thought and that theme throughout this book

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,920
and both books, 1 and 2 Timothy,

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,319
and we're very thankful for the opportunity

11
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,780
that we have to be able to study

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,239
this portion of scripture this morning.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,479
This letter, as you know, those who have been here,

14
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,240
and for those of you that have not,

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
we'll get into the text this morning,

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
but this letter from Paul to Timothy

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,959
provides encouragement.

18
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,880
We all need encouragement, don't we?

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,720
And there are times in this life

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,080
that it can become overwhelming

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,819
and we need to receive encouragement.

22
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:51,360
We find that Timothy was left in Ephesus with a great task.

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
And that task was at times overwhelming.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
He's dealing with false teachers

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,119
and all sorts of things that are going on.

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,639
And we find that God would use Paul to write this letter,

27
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,119
of course, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,400
to give encouragement to his man,

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,480
to his servant to continue.

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,120
We find not only does this letter provide encouragement,

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,760
but it provides a warning.

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
And by the way, we all need encouragement,

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,000
but there are times that we all need warnings.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,040
And I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,480
in the book of Psalms in the 19th chapter,

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,040
that by them speaking of God's word

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,599
and how thankful I am for the word

38
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,160
is thy servant warned.

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,040
And in keeping of them is great reward.

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,639
You have many things in your house today

41
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,839
that have warning labels on them.

42
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,919
You drive, you drove here this morning

43
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,400
and you saw various signs.

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,160
And at times you see warning about something that's ahead,

45
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,879
something that you're going to face.

46
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,220
And we find that there are warnings in life,

47
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,360
but God also in his word has provided us with warnings

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,440
and oh, how thankful I am for the encouragement.

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,599
Oh, how thankful I am for the warnings.

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,919
We also find that God gives instruction

51
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,760
and oh, how we need instruction.

52
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,699
I know that many of us men,

53
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,599
we've tried to put things together before

54
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,860
without the instructions.

55
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,399
And maybe we've come to a place

56
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,720
where we've gotten frustrated.

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,880
We thought what's going on?

58
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
Is it written in a different language?

59
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Is it upside down?

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,119
Who wrote these instructions?

61
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,639
And we set them to the side and say,

62
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,160
we're gonna just do it ourselves.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,580
And if you do it, like I do it,

64
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,080
you get to do it two or three times by yourself.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,639
And find those instructions that you set aside

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,839
and realize humbly that I probably

67
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,199
should take these instructions

68
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,600
because whoever wrote them knows more than I do.

69
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,559
You know, God gave us a wonderful book.

70
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,880
He is the omniscient God.

71
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,979
He's the all wise God.

72
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,399
He knows more than all of us together.

73
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,880
And he has given us instruction in his word

74
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,639
and oh, how we need the instruction and how blessed we are.

75
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,000
Timothy was ministering there in Ephesus.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,100
He had a great responsibility.

77
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,179
I mentioned already that the false teachers,

78
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,660
they were active and Timothy needed

79
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,380
to withstand their activity.

80
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,619
He needed to withstand their false teaching.

81
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,460
He needed to guide the members of the church

82
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,339
in the way that they ought to go.

83
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,979
We find that the members of that church

84
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,619
needed to understand how they were to properly behave

85
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,440
and also interact one with another.

86
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,740
We find that throughout this letter,

87
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,979
as we've mentioned in previous messages,

88
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,220
that God gives instruction for behavior in his house

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,539
and how we are to behave ourselves.

90
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,139
There is behavior that is appropriate

91
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,979
and there's behavior that's inappropriate.

92
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,619
I was at a conference this past week

93
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,339
and I was at that conference and they listed

94
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,179
right on all the instruction after you registered

95
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,100
to go to that conference.

96
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,820
It said, by the way, at the bottom of it,

97
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,039
it said, if you do this, this, or this,

98
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,339
you will be escorted immediately.

99
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:49,179
And I thought, well, there is behavior for this conference

100
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,919
that's appropriate and acceptable

101
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,320
and there is behavior for this conference

102
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,860
that is not going to be tolerated

103
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,139
and they put it right there in black and white letters.

104
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,059
If you do these things, you are out

105
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,979
and by the way, no refund.

106
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,940
And they weren't playing games.

107
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,500
And what I say to you this morning

108
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,460
is that the house of God is a sacred place.

109
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,339
It's a holy place as his people are gathered together

110
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,979
as we pray for his presence to be with us,

111
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:19,500
that we desire to worship him in spirit and in truth,

112
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,980
that there is behavior that is appropriate and acceptable

113
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,660
and there is behavior that is not well-pleasing to God.

114
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,160
And we find here this morning that through this book

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,380
that God has given not only encouragement

116
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,940
and warning and instruction,

117
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,640
we benefit just as Timothy did,

118
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,380
just as the church in Ephesus did,

119
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,059
we today benefit from all of these things.

120
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,619
And I'm thankful this morning

121
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,019
that the Lord is the head of the church, it's his church.

122
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,579
It's not my church, it's not your church, it's his church.

123
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,779
And he promises that he will build his church

124
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,739
and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

125
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,380
By the way, that's a promise that's made in Matthew 16

126
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,220
that we can stand upon, that we can trust

127
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,100
and that we can rejoice in

128
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,899
and knowing that he is king of kings

129
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,260
and Lord of lords, he's on his throne.

130
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,899
We sang this morning, Jesus saves,

131
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:16,540
and what a joy to know that he does.

132
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,660
I wanna remind you that he's coming back again.

133
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,200
I don't know when he's coming,

134
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,339
but I'm looking forward to hearing the trumpet of the Lord.

135
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,380
Amen, in time shall be no more.

136
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,299
We're gonna go be with our Lord and savior.

137
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,700
He's the head of the church.

138
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,940
As the head of the church,

139
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,679
he has graciously instructed his church.

140
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,480
Not only the church here in Ephesus

141
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
that Timothy had the responsibility to lead and to guide,

142
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,119
but we find that God has providentially preserved his word

143
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:48,000
so that every church throughout the era

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,760
of the church history would have the instruction

145
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,100
so that we would know how we are to behave,

146
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,700
so that we would know how we're to interact one with another

147
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,000
so that we would understand how we can please the Lord.

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,320
I don't wanna be in a position as a church,

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
as an individual, as a family.

150
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,679
I don't wanna be in a position

151
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:11,079
where God would look at my life as an individual,

152
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,799
our home as a family, our church corporately,

153
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,760
and say, I am not pleased.

154
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,799
No, I long for God to be pleased with my life

155
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,640
and with us as a church.

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,600
I do not want, as you would read in the Old Testament,

157
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Ichabod written that the glory of the Lord hath departed.

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,880
No, we serve a risen God.

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,839
He lives.

160
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,279
We sang it this morning.

161
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,839
And what a joy to know that he is the head of our church

162
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,920
and he has given us instruction

163
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,040
that when that instruction is followed,

164
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,420
it enables us to please him.

165
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,399
A few weeks ago, we started 1 Timothy chapter number five,

166
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,519
and the first section of this particular book

167
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,880
addresses relationships in the church,

168
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,920
and it deals with the senior saints and the younger saints,

169
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,239
and it deals with widows.

170
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,339
And we studied that portion of scripture

171
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,459
beginning in verse number one down through verse number 16.

172
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,880
We mentioned that the senior saints

173
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,220
are referenced as being the elder in verses one and two,

174
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,160
and that's not the office of the elder, the pastor.

175
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,220
That is just those that were older

176
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,059
that I've referred to as being senior saints.

177
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,839
You say, pastor, I'm a senior saint.

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,019
You figure it out.

179
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,660
I'm not going there, amen?

180
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,739
But the reality is that there are, in every good church,

181
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:31,459
a church that should have different ages

182
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,059
of people in the church.

183
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,179
There should be some senior saints,

184
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,500
but there should be some new believers.

185
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,459
And everywhere in between, why?

186
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,540
Because we're pressing forward for the cause of Christ

187
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,859
to reach a lost and dying world.

188
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,619
We find that the chapter concludes

189
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,420
beginning in verse number 17

190
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,299
down through the end of the chapter in verse number 25

191
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,980
with instruction regarding elders.

192
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,059
Now, this is the office of a pastor

193
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,100
that is being referenced.

194
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,899
You'll recall, maybe you were here several weeks ago

195
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,899
as we studied there in chapter number three,

196
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,019
and the Bible says, this is a true saying

197
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:11,540
in verse number one, if a man desire the office of a bishop,

198
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,619
he desireth a good work.

199
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,000
And we mentioned as we studied

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,299
through that portion of scripture

201
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:19,140
that God uses these terms in his word

202
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,779
of bishop and elder interchangeably,

203
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,500
and they refer to the same office that we refer to today

204
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,619
as being the office of the pastor.

205
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,459
And we find that the instruction is given

206
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,900
when he begins in verse number 17,

207
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,539
let the elders that rule well

208
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,780
be counted worthy of double honor,

209
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,179
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine

210
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,299
for the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox

211
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,940
that treadeth out the corn,

212
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,780
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

213
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,299
Notice again in verse 19,

214
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:54,940
against an elder received an accusation,

215
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,419
but before two or three witnesses.

216
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,780
And so we find that in verse number 17,

217
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,419
and then again in verse number 19,

218
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,260
that he addresses in this section,

219
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,539
the elder, the pastor of the church.

220
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,539
I've titled the message this morning,

221
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,979
Honorable Elders, Honorable Elders.

222
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,020
I only have two points for you this morning,

223
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
but don't get excited.

224
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,179
That doesn't mean the message will be any shorter.

225
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,299
And the reality is that many of you take notes

226
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,140
and you get used to having three points

227
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,979
throughout the message.

228
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,739
This morning, we have two thoughts for you.

229
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,219
Number one, if you're taking notes,

230
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,140
the compensation for an elder,

231
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,739
the compensation for an elder.

232
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,900
I read verse 17 and 18.

233
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,940
Let me read them again for you.

234
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,460
The Bible says, let the elders that rule well

235
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,900
be counted worthy of double honor,

236
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,140
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine

237
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,780
for the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox

238
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,380
that treadeth out the corn,

239
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,979
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

240
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,460
As we're gonna look at this passage of scripture again,

241
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,780
God is giving to the church at Ephesus

242
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,659
to Timothy as its leader,

243
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,179
instruction for behavior in the church,

244
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,580
that which pleases the Lord.

245
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,140
the Lord, that which does not please the Lord. He deals in the beginning of the

246
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,500
chapter the interactions between the senior saints, the younger believers. He

247
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,020
deals extensively in this chapter with widows, and then he comes to the subject

248
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,540
of dealing with the elders. He begins in verses 17 and 18 by dealing with the

249
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,660
compensation for an elder. Before we really deal with the compensation, I

250
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,860
want you to understand that the pastor has a responsibility. The responsibility

251
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,300
the pastor is dictated for us here. Notice the Bible says, let the elders

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,740
that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, but then notice the end of

253
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:43,820
the verse, especially they who, do you see the word labor? In word and doctrine. The

254
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,300
end of verse number 18, the laborer is worthy of his reward. The pastor has a

255
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,700
responsibility to labor in the word and in doctrine. It is my God-given

256
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,380
responsibility. When God called me to be a pastor, when God placed that call upon

257
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,800
my life, He gave me responsibility, and the responsibility is great. The

258
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,980
responsibility to feed the flock of God. What a joy that I have. I thoroughly

259
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,180
enjoy preaching and teaching God's Word. Sometimes, if we're not careful, we could

260
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,660
think that that's the only aspect of pastoring. It really is just the most

261
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,940
public aspect of the ministry of being a pastor, but we find that it's such an

262
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,140
important aspect. The pastor has a responsibility to labor in the word and

263
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,700
in doctrine. We find that it's so imperative that we understand this

264
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,140
morning that the pastor, that as I personally have the opportunity to

265
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,940
fulfill that role at Fellowship Baptist Church, that it is laboring in God's Word.

266
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,380
Someone asked me years ago, they came to me and they meant it as a compliment, and

267
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,140
they said this, pastor, those messages that you've preached have been very

268
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,500
helpful. I very much enjoy them. Are you getting them from a book? And I said, yes,

269
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,020
the Bible. And the reality is that I study, and I'm not patting myself on the

270
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,340
back, it is my God-given responsibility to dig into the Word of God and to

271
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:20,100
provide the flock of God with truth, with doctrine, that which is going to

272
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,020
help, that which is going to build up so that we might be sound in the faith.

273
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,300
That's my responsibility. That is a pastor's responsibility. We find that

274
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,900
that's not the end of the responsibility, but with regard to the context of what

275
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,300
we're looking at here, we find that he speaks about this laboring in word and

276
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,100
in doctrine. I like the fact that he uses the word labor because it is work. It is

277
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,660
work. And there are times I've been asked this question, how long does it take to

278
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,420
prepare a message? And the reality is that it varies. Sometimes a message can

279
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,460
come to you real quick. I mean, God just, man, He just gives...other times it is

280
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,820
just...it is work. And someone asked me, what do you do all week? I said, well, how

281
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,860
about you come and visit with me all week? And you can shadow me all week. It's

282
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,460
an open invitation. You can be with me. And then if you want to preach four

283
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,220
times next week, you go ahead and do it. You get to prepare four lessons next week.

284
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:23,020
And it's labor. Listen, I'm not interested in giving some cheap meal to our church.

285
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm just not. The reality is that you can have, I think, about often this context of

286
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,740
feeding the flock of God. And I like home-cooked meals. I much prefer home-cooked

287
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,900
meals over frozen entrees. Amen? I like fresh home-cooked meals more than I like

288
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,740
leftovers. Now, I'll eat leftovers because I don't want to waste it, but I like it

289
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,540
when there's no leftovers. Why? Because that means there's another fresh meal

290
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,580
tomorrow. Amen? Joseph hates leftovers. I mean, he just...last...the week before they

291
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,140
went to camp, it seemed like every day we had leftovers. And Holly said, what do you

292
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:04,380
want for lunch? I said, I do not want any more leftovers. I am leftovered out.

293
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:11,580
Listen, this book is a living book. This Word will help you and it will help me.

294
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,660
And every time I come to the pulpit, I want to come with a fresh truth that God

295
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,820
has given to us with a measure of excitement. Why? Because this is God's Word

296
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,020
and it's a living book. This is not dead orthodoxy. This is not religion. And we

297
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,780
were knocking doors, Ronnie and I knocking doors, not yesterday, but last Saturday.

298
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,700
And some man says, well, you know, just to be honest with you, I'm not a religious

299
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,820
person. Isn't that what he said, Ronnie? And I said, well, sir, neither am I. And he

300
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,500
said, I don't believe you. He put his hand on his hip and he said, I don't believe

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,180
you. And I just introduced myself as being from the church. And he said, you've got

302
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,980
to be a religious person. Religion. I'm not interested in religion. I'm

303
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,300
interested in relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. And what a joy to know that

304
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,940
he lives and he lives within me. And it's real. It's not just dead orthodoxy. And I

305
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,260
desire to fulfill the responsibility. I know. Listen, I'm not the greatest

306
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,860
preacher I don't ever claim to be, but I want to give God's Word. It's the

307
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,300
responsibility. But let me say this, not only does the pastor have a responsibility,

308
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,860
the church has a responsibility. He says in verse number 18, notice what he says,

309
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,620
for the scripture saith. This is a biblical truth. This is not just Timothy,

310
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,980
Paul's opinion that he's given to Timothy. He says, this is a, the scripture saith.

311
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,180
This is a biblical truth. By the way, when he uses this phrase and says, for the

312
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,980
scripture saith, he references really two verses of scripture. Thou shall not muzzle

313
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,020
the ox that treadeth out the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his reward. We're

314
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,060
not going to take the time, but if you went back to Deuteronomy 25 in verse

315
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,900
number four, and if you went back to Luke chapter 10 in verse number seven, those

316
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,660
are the two references that are given to us in verse number 18. And we find that

317
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,220
Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, refers to both of those as

318
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,620
being scripture. And that's an important thing for us to understand. I'm so

319
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,420
thankful for the scripture, for the word of God, for thus saith the Lord. And so

320
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,060
what does he say? He says that the, in verse number 17, let the elders that rule

321
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,540
well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and

322
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,060
doctrine. For the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out

323
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,100
the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his reward. We find that the pastor,

324
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,580
indeed, it's certainly to be noted that the pastor is not to be greedy, a filthy

325
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,700
lucre. The Bible gives that as a requirement in 1 Timothy 3. In verse

326
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,500
number 3, he again says it in 1 Peter chapter 5, in verse number 2. But we

327
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,060
understand this morning that the pastor must be compensated in order to provide

328
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,220
for his family. It just is what it is. Now, I'll be honest with you, this is one

329
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,660
of the hardest subjects for me to ever preach on. It really is. It's a difficult

330
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,100
subject, being the pastor of the church. This is an easy passage to preach from if

331
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm preaching somewhere else, just to be honest with you, because it's a biblical

332
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,060
truth. Why do I say it's a difficult thing? Because people hear what they want

333
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,700
to hear. They receive what they want to receive. They think, assume what they want

334
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,380
to assume. And so let me be very clear this morning, before I say anything more,

335
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,460
I would like to say this. Fellowship Baptist Church has been good to us,

336
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,500
and I appreciate that. It's been a blessing to our family. But I want you to

337
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,700
understand that not all churches have this understanding, not all churches have

338
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,380
this perspective. I know churches right now that need pastors. In our state of

339
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,900
Virginia, our Commonwealth of Virginia, there are churches that need pastors.

340
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,340
You begin to talk to those churches, you say, well, what are you going to be able

341
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,940
to compensate them? Well, we just can't pay them. Well, how do you want somebody

342
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,140
to come and minister? What do you want them to do? Well, we can pay them $25,000.

343
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,260
Can you live on $25,000 a year? I'm just being honest with you. And it's one of

344
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,380
those things you begin to look at and you say, listen, the pastor, he has a responsibility,

345
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:15,420
but the church has a responsibility. And we understand that this is what God's plan is.

346
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,060
This is God's truth that He's given to us. Look at a few verses of Scripture with me.

347
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,300
Turn to the book of Romans, if you will. It's not just a truth that's just isolated here

348
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,620
to the book of 1 Timothy. Over the book of Romans, in chapter 15, we're going to look

349
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,500
at three other portions of Scripture very quickly this morning. And again, I've mentioned

350
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
already to preface it by saying fellowship after church has been good to us, and we've been blessed,

351
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,220
and I am thankful, and I appreciate the spirit and the attitude of our church family. But the

352
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,780
reality is that not everyone has this understanding. For generations, the idea of many churches was

353
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,220
that the pastor should be poor. That's just the reality. That was the perspective of a lot of

354
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:05,820
people. And the reality is that God has given a responsibility. Notice in Romans 15, in verse 27,

355
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,900
they have pleased them verily, and their debtors they are. Notice this,

356
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,220
for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, notice what it says,

357
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:26,860
their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. So we see this distinction

358
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,260
between spiritual things and carnal things. The spiritual things, that's the responsibility of

359
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,340
the pastor. That's the responsibility of the leader of the church with regard to the office

360
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,980
of a pastor in the context of what we're dealing with, that we are to minister. Listen, they're

361
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,780
partakers of spiritual things, but then it says their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal

362
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,820
things. I've heard people say this over the years, well, the pastor can just go get a job.

363
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,380
He can, absolutely. But do you know how that changes the ministry of the pastor?

364
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,700
Honestly, it changes.

365
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,020
The pastor is working a full-time job somewhere else so that he can provide for his family.

366
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,940
By the way, he has a Biblical responsibility to provide for his family.

367
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,080
Amen?

368
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,100
He has a Biblical responsibility.

369
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,660
If he doesn't provide for his family, he's worse than an infidel.

370
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,900
We read that last time we were in 1 Timothy chapter 5, and so there's a Biblical responsibility.

371
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,060
Oh, well, the pastor can go to a job.

372
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,420
He can.

373
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,500
But if the pastor's working 40, 50 hours a week, how available do you think he is to

374
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,140
prepare messages?

375
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,860
How available do you think he is when you pick up the phone and say, hey, I have a ... And

376
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
you get voicemail.

377
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
You get no call back.

378
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Why?

379
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Because he's at work.

380
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
It's just the way it is.

381
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,860
I know a pastor friend down in the Richmond area, and he's pastor of the church for 27

382
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
years now.

383
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,340
But he shared this story with me, he's about to retire, and he shared this story with me

384
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,580
when he first got there to pastor.

385
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,380
They just flat out did not pay him like they should have or like they could have.

386
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
The finances were there.

387
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,820
It wasn't a matter of not having the ability, it was just that they chose not to.

388
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,940
And so after being there for about two months, he realized, I'm going in debt.

389
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,300
I can't cover the expenses of my family that's more expensive to live here than I thought

390
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
it was going to be.

391
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,860
And he put all these numbers together and he went and he had a meeting with the men

392
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,580
of the church after a Sunday morning.

393
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,980
And here's what he said, folks, I just want you to know, I'm going tomorrow to get a job.

394
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,460
He said, what do you mean you're getting a job?

395
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:30,340
Well, here's what you're paying me and here's what my expenses are and I just can't survive.

396
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,900
He didn't ask for them to pay him anymore.

397
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
He didn't demand that they pay them anymore.

398
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,220
He just simply said, I got to go get a job.

399
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,840
And then he asked this question.

400
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,860
He said, I just want to know how many of you could live here on that salary.

401
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,340
And they said, pastor, would you be dismissed?

402
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,940
And they decided that day that they were going to pay him like they should have, like they

403
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,660
could have, so that he didn't have to go get another job.

404
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,460
Here's the Lord.

405
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,380
But the reality is that it's a biblical responsibility, these carnal things, and it's a mindset that

406
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,460
sometimes people have, well, you can just go get a job.

407
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,540
Well, it affects the whole ministry.

408
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,260
There are some pastors that are bivocational, just the way it has to be.

409
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,500
And that's a sad situation when it has to be that way because you can't do both well.

410
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,940
First Corinthians chapter number nine, notice what the Bible says in this portion of Scripture.

411
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,800
In First Corinthians nine, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, and he's giving

412
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,500
the same truth that he mentioned to those in Rome.

413
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,340
He says in verse 11 of First Corinthians nine, if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

414
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,820
is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

415
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,980
Again, he uses these two terms of spiritual and carnal.

416
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,740
He's not using the word carnal in Romans or here in First Corinthians as being a bad thing.

417
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,980
Like he says to them, you're carnal, you can't receive these things.

418
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,860
That's a negative connotation.

419
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:57,080
But when he's talking here, he's talking about the things that we need to live, to survive.

420
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,480
Most of you are not going to go to work for free, amen?

421
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,400
Most of you, when you got a job wherever you're working, you found out what you were going

422
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,300
to be compensated, amen?

423
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
You did.

424
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,820
I didn't.

425
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
I didn't ask the question.

426
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,380
When I came to pastor this church, I had zero idea what I was going to get paid.

427
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,639
I'm just being honest.

428
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:21,760
Those men that were here the day that I accepted the position, they can verify that.

429
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,480
I did not know.

430
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,800
Every year that I've been here, Doc was the treasurer for years, then Jared, and then

431
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,380
now Pierre, and Dean is one of our deacons, been a deacon since I've been here.

432
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,400
Every year, and these men, Jared's not here anymore, he moved to South Carolina, but they

433
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,040
can verify every year they would come to me and say, pastor, what do you need to make?

434
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
What do you need for a pay raise?

435
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,800
I've never answered the question.

436
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
Not one time.

437
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,800
When I worked in the corporate world, I got everything I could get.

438
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,960
I'm just being honest with you.

439
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,200
When I worked in the corporate world, I got everything I could get.

440
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,100
I negotiated.

441
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,360
It's different in the spiritual world, but the pastor still has needs.

442
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,940
Some of you have paid for college for your children.

443
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,960
Don't you think a pastor wants to pay for college for his children?

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Again, don't take this as a negative to our church.

445
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
The church has been great to us.

446
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,720
It's a biblical truth that unfortunately there are churches today that they don't understand

447
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,119
it.

448
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,500
They think this, the pastor's just in it for the money.

449
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,000
There are some that are.

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,959
There are some that are, and it's terrible.

451
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:41,040
They ought not be in that position, but can I tell you because there are some that are,

452
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,080
it doesn't mean all are.

453
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,520
There are some that are laboring in the word and in doctrine, and they are, as we've titled

454
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,360
the message this morning, honorable elders.

455
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,040
In Galatians chapter 6, a third reference that God gives us with regard to this subject

456
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,059
matter, and we'll move right along.

457
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:10,440
Notice in Galatians 6 and verse number 6, let him that is taught in the word communicate

458
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,959
unto him that teacheth in all good things.

459
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:21,080
It's the same principle that we saw in the book of Romans, in the book of 1 Corinthians.

460
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Now if you understand the book of Galatians, there's not a church in Galatia that's being

461
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
written to.

462
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,559
There are four churches in the region of Galatia that were established during the first missionary

463
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,619
journey.

464
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:37,239
Now we see it in 1 Timothy with regard to the instruction to the church and to Timothy

465
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:43,160
there in Ephesus, and so we find that this is a biblical truth, this is a biblical responsibility.

466
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,440
I've had the privilege of working with new pastors that are starting churches, and can

467
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,959
I tell you it's a difficult thing when you've got to start talking about money.

468
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:54,040
It's just complicated, it's difficult.

469
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,520
I didn't have any problem in the corporate world, but it's different in the church setting.

470
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,119
And I've talked to pastors, I said, listen, you are robbing your church of their God-given

471
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,279
responsibility to compensate you, because it is a God-given responsibility.

472
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,820
Well, we just want to support more missionaries.

473
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,540
It's great to support more missionaries, but you better take care of your pastor.

474
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,000
It's a responsibility that God has given.

475
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,520
So we see, first of all, the compensation for an elder.

476
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,520
Number two, I want you to notice in this passage of Scripture the conduct of an elder, the

477
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
conduct of an elder.

478
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,880
Now as we look at the rest of the text, beginning in verse 19 down through verse 25, we find

479
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,720
that God is going to deal with the conduct.

480
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Now listen, the qualifications for an elder are detailed in 1 Timothy chapter 3.

481
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,480
We see them in the book of Titus as well, but we've studied them, and we said that the

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,820
qualifications are given.

483
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,520
These aren't just, we would like it if you had, no, these are qualifications, he must

484
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
be.

485
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
All right?

486
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,320
That's the verbiage that is used repeatedly.

487
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,119
And so we see the qualifications are outlined in detail in 1 Timothy chapter number 3.

488
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,440
In 1 Timothy chapter number 5, we find that we are provided with some practical instruction

489
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,920
regarding the conduct of an elder.

490
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,839
Let me remind you, I mentioned in 1 Peter chapter 5 in verse number 2, you don't need

491
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,080
to turn there, but it talks about filthy lucre or those that are there for lucre, but we

492
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,160
find that it also says in verse number 3 that the elder or the pastor is an ensample to

493
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,279
the flock, an ensample to the flock.

494
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,360
It's a sad thing this morning that there are some elders, even here in recent days,

495
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,040
that have been exposed for some great wickedness.

496
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,520
I know an elder, a pastor, that sat in a courtroom after he was charged with heinous crimes,

497
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,559
and he sat in that courtroom and he said this quote when he gave an answer to the judge,

498
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,760
I did not know I was breaking the law.

499
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,980
I will not tell you what the man was guilty of doing.

500
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,660
It is absolutely immoral and egregious, but he said to the judge, I did not know I was

501
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,899
breaking the law.

502
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:04,899
What was he referring to?

503
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:11,420
He was referring to the law of the land, but I want you to know he was breaking God's law.

504
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,899
Regardless of what the law of the land was, he was breaking God's law.

505
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,860
And listen, the Bible says in the book of Romans, hey, you that teach that you shouldn't

506
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
steal, do you steal?

507
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,260
No, it doesn't work that way.

508
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,419
The conduct of an elder is of great importance, and he is to be an example to the flock.

509
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,859
We see here in the text of Scripture a couple of things that we want to note.

510
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:40,900
Number one, an elder should pursue purity.

511
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,099
An elder should pursue purity.

512
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,099
And I'm going to say this at the end.

513
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,380
I'll say it now, I'll say it again at the end.

514
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,580
These truths that we're looking at with regard to the conduct of an elder are not just isolated

515
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,859
for elders.

516
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:56,500
Every child of God should pursue purity.

517
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,660
Because every man that hath this hope, what hope according to 1 John 3, that Jesus is

518
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,900
coming again, he maketh himself pure even as he is pure.

519
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,700
So this idea of pursuing purity is not just something that's reserved for the elder, for

520
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,440
the pastor of the church, but we find that all of God's people should pursue purity.

521
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,260
We see that, look in verse number 19, it talks about dealing with sin in verses 19 and 20.

522
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:39,619
Now, we understand that no person, pastor, elder, church person, no individual saved

523
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:44,500
by the grace of God person is ever going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

524
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Amen?

525
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:51,419
And listen, I'm thankful this morning that I have been saved and I have been delivered

526
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,299
from the power of sin and from the penalty of sin, but I have not yet been delivered

527
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,299
from the presence of sin.

528
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,419
One day, one glorious day.

529
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,419
I'm going to go to heaven, and I don't know when that's going to be,

530
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,419
but I'm looking forward to going to heaven.

531
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,419
And guess what? There is no sin in heaven.

532
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,419
I am so thankful we will be delivered from the very presence of sin.

533
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:15,419
Actively right now, sin no longer has power over me.

534
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,419
Why? Because I've been saved by the grace of God.

535
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,419
I'm no longer bound by the power of sin.

536
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,419
Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

537
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:29,419
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

538
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:31,419
Listen, it's not a valid thing to say, I just didn't have a choice.

539
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:34,419
No, you did have a choice.

540
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:39,419
Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

541
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,419
But we're never going to be sinless.

542
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:45,419
Okay? We're never going to be sinless.

543
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:50,419
But we find here that as we look at this passage of Scripture with this pursuit of purity,

544
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:56,419
it should be that our desire as we walk with Christ is that we sin less and less.

545
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,419
That we don't get comfortable with sin in our lives, for any child of God.

546
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,419
But especially as we look at the context here with regard to a pastor, an elder,

547
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:08,419
he says, then that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear.

548
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:12,419
Listen, the pastor is not above the law.

549
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,419
It should never be thought of that way. It should never be presented that way.

550
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,419
No, listen, how many of you, and I know we've got some police officers here, and that's fine.

551
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,419
I don't mean to offend you.

552
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,419
But the reality is, some of the times you get irritated with a police officer

553
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,419
that's going 95 miles an hour down the road, and then he wants to pull you over for going 72.

554
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,419
You're like, what's up with that?

555
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,419
Now, I haven't gotten pulled over recently, praise the Lord, so I'm not nothing.

556
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,419
But I'm just saying, it's frustrating. Why?

557
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:39,419
Because the police officer's acting like he's above the law. Right?

558
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,419
He has this little badge that he can show his body, and he can get away.

559
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,419
It doesn't always happen that way, but I'm saying it can be a frustrating thing.

560
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,419
The pastor is not above the law.

561
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:54,419
The pastor is more accountable to whom much is given, much is required.

562
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,419
And we find that a pastor, an honorable elder, he should be pursuing purity.

563
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,419
And we deal with sin. We see it in verses 19 and 20.

564
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,419
We find, notice in verse 21,

565
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,419
I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels

566
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,419
that thou observe these things without preferring one before another,

567
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,419
doing nothing by partiality.

568
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,419
Notice in verse 22, lay hands suddenly on no man,

569
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,419
neither be partaker of other men's sins.

570
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:25,419
Notice these three words, keep thyself pure.

571
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,419
Listen, there are some things that you need to do in your life.

572
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:32,419
There are some fences that you need to put up in your life to preserve purity

573
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,419
as you're pursuing purity.

574
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,419
A fence doesn't, it serves two purposes.

575
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:39,419
A fence is not just to keep you in.

576
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:45,419
You know how many young people have the idea that fences are just to keep you in?

577
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,419
I want to do, but my parents won't let me.

578
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,419
No, no, the fences, the warnings, they don't only just keep you in,

579
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,419
but they keep evil out.

580
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,419
And it's a blessing.

581
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,419
And here he says, keep thyself pure.

582
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,419
We mentioned already in 1 John chapter 3, verses 1 through 3,

583
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:06,419
we believe that Jesus is coming again, and if we have that belief,

584
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,419
we are to purify ourselves even as he is pure.

585
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,419
And so we find, notice in verse 24 specifically,

586
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,419
it says this, some men's sins are open beforehand,

587
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,419
going before the judgment, and some men they follow after.

588
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,419
Likewise, also verse 25, the good works of some are manifest beforehand,

589
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,419
and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

590
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,419
What's he saying in verse 24 and 25?

591
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,419
Listen, sometimes you can see the wickedness from a mile away.

592
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,419
Sometimes people have gotten clever on how to cover it up.

593
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,419
But can I remind you of a secret?

594
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,419
It's really not a secret.

595
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,419
You can't cover anything from God.

596
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,419
You can try.

597
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:53,419
But Proverbs says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

598
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,419
Shall not prosper.

599
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,419
Whoso confesseth and forsaketh, well then, they're going to find mercy.

600
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,419
Why? Because we have a merciful God.

601
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:02,419
We have a gracious God.

602
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,419
We have a God that the Bible says that with thee there is forgiveness.

603
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,419
Hallelujah.

604
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,419
I remember Rachel there in the book of Genesis.

605
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:20,419
She knew that she had the stuff in the tent.

606
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:23,419
What about as you look at Achan?

607
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:26,419
The troubler of Israel is referred to in the book of 1 Chronicles.

608
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,419
He knew that he had stuff in the tent.

609
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:32,419
He took of the accursed thing.

610
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:38,419
I want you to know that though they knew and they hid, that God exposed.

611
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:44,419
There's a truth in the book of Numbers that says be sure your sin will find you out.

612
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,419
The reality is that sometimes you can see it from a mile away.

613
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,419
Sometimes people are not really good at covering things up.

614
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:52,419
But you can't hide from God.

615
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,419
You can't hide from God.

616
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:58,419
God knows, he sees, he's everywhere present.

617
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:02,419
The reality this morning is that the truth of God being everywhere present

618
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:06,419
is a truth that causes me to have great comfort,

619
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:09,419
but it also should bring great conviction because he's everywhere.

620
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:12,419
He's with you.

621
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,419
And we're to pursue purity.

622
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:18,419
Not only pursue purity, but number two, when we talk about the conduct of an elder,

623
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:20,419
we should pursue purity.

624
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,419
We should reject partiality.

625
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:25,419
Reject partiality.

626
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,419
Notice what the Bible says in verse 21.

627
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,419
Really this idea of partial or being partial to someone

628
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,419
or this idea of partiality as being a respecter of persons.

629
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,419
And we're to be no respecter of persons.

630
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:38,419
Verse 21, it says, I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ

631
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,419
and the elect angels that thou observe these things,

632
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:45,419
notice, without preferring one another, one before another,

633
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:49,419
notice doing nothing by partiality.

634
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:52,419
This is a Bible word that's a good word.

635
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:55,419
We're to not be a respecter of persons.

636
00:35:55,419 --> 00:36:00,419
A minister, a pastor, every child of God

637
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:05,419
ought to understand this morning that we are all made in the image of God.

638
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:08,419
Do you believe that this morning?

639
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,419
God is the creator.

640
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,419
And we have been made in his image.

641
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,419
And God so loved who?

642
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,419
The world.

643
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:18,419
Every person.

644
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:23,419
And we find that here, he says, let nothing be done by partiality.

645
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:25,419
And we're to reject partiality,

646
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:30,419
a word that's so often that would be used in our vernacular today is racism.

647
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:32,419
And we see it in our society.

648
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:34,419
We see the divide that it causes.

649
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:36,419
But I want you to understand as a child of God,

650
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:39,419
there should be no level of racism whatsoever.

651
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:41,419
Why?

652
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,419
Because we're all of one blood.

653
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,419
We're all made in the image of God.

654
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,419
We're all valuable in God's sight.

655
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:52,419
And we must understand this morning that it's absolutely imperative

656
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,419
that we look at the conduct of an elder

657
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:58,419
and we say not only is he to pursue purity,

658
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:04,419
but he is to reject partiality.

659
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:08,419
Not partial to anyone on any basis.

660
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:09,419
Amen?

661
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,419
That's the biblical truth.

662
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:14,419
By the way, it's not just a biblical truth for the pastor.

663
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:16,419
It's a biblical truth for every child of God.

664
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:18,419
Look at the book of Proverbs, if you will.

665
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,419
We're going to look at just a few verses.

666
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:23,419
We had a bunch more written down, but we're running out of time this morning.

667
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:25,419
I told you that two points didn't mean it'd be any faster.

668
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:27,419
Proverbs 24 and verse 23.

669
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:32,419
Notice what the Bible says in Proverbs 24 and verse number 23.

670
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,419
These things also belong to the wise.

671
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:40,419
It is not good to have respective persons in judgment.

672
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:44,419
It is not good to have respective persons in judgment.

673
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:46,419
Proverbs 28 and verse number 21.

674
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:49,419
We find again this truth restated.

675
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:54,419
It says to have respective persons is not good.

676
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:58,419
For a piece of bread that man will transgress.

677
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,419
We're to be no respecter of persons.

678
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,419
The book of James deals with it this way.

679
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:05,419
Turn to James chapter 2, if you will.

680
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:07,419
In the New Testament, the book of James.

681
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,419
And I want you to see in James chapter number 2.

682
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:13,419
And we will not have time to read the entirety,

683
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:16,419
the portion of Scripture, really verses 1 through 9.

684
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,419
I'll just read a few of these verses.

685
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:22,419
This idea of rejecting partiality.

686
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:25,419
The Bible says in James chapter 2 and verse number 1.

687
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:32,419
By the way, can I say this?

688
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:34,419
Jesus was counter-cultural.

689
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,419
What do I mean by that?

690
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:40,419
Do you know that the Jewish people hated the Samaritans?

691
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,419
They hated them.

692
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:44,419
They would not go.

693
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,419
They would not interact with.

694
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:48,419
They would not have conversation with.

695
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:50,419
They hated the Samaritans.

696
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:54,419
But Jesus in John chapter number 4 says,

697
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:58,419
I must needs go through Samaria.

698
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,419
He didn't go around Samaria

699
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:04,419
as was the standard behavior of the day.

700
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,419
He went through Samaria.

701
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:07,419
Why?

702
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,419
Well, there's a widow that he needed to meet.

703
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,419
The widow at the well.

704
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:13,419
By the way, it wasn't just the widow

705
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:14,419
because she went back

706
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,419
and she told all those people about Jesus.

707
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:20,419
And there was a great host of people that got saved

708
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:24,419
because Jesus went to Samaria.

709
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:27,419
And by the way, when he gave the Great Commission,

710
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:29,419
he said in the book of Acts,

711
00:39:29,419 --> 00:39:31,419
and you shall be witnesses unto me,

712
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:33,419
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

713
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:36,419
you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea,

714
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:37,419
and where?

715
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,419
Samaria.

716
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,419
And under the uttermost part of the earth.

717
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,419
He was counter-cultural.

718
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:44,419
He loved all people.

719
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,419
Because they're all made in the image of God.

720
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:48,419
In James chapter 2 and verse number 1,

721
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,419
the Bible says this in verse 2,

722
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,419
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring

723
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:53,419
and goodly apparel,

724
00:39:53,419 --> 00:39:55,419
and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment,

725
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:57,419
do you see the picture that's being painted?

726
00:39:57,419 --> 00:40:00,419
You begin to see that one appears

727
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:04,739
to have some money and the other appears to be poor.

728
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,179
And he says, and ye have respect to him

729
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:08,419
that weareth the gay clothing.

730
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,759
Now understand that's the old English word of gay, okay?

731
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,299
It's not talking about the new way

732
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:15,739
that people are using that word, so just understand that.

733
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,259
And saying to him, sit thou here in a good place

734
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:20,619
and say to the poor, stand thou there

735
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,579
or sit here under my footstool.

736
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:25,539
Are ye not then partial in yourselves

737
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:29,139
and are become judges of evil thoughts?

738
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,179
Verse nine, he says this,

739
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,419
but if you have respect to persons, ye commit what?

740
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,279
Sin, that's pretty plain, isn't it?

741
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,019
I think it's not difficult to understand

742
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,299
that verse of scripture.

743
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:44,219
If ye have respect to persons, you commit sin

744
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,579
and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

745
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,819
You know that back in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter one

746
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:51,059
and again in chapter number 16,

747
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,599
it talks about not having respect of persons.

748
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,179
This is a Bible truth from the beginning to the end.

749
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,979
Our God has no respect of persons.

750
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:00,299
By the way, I'm thankful for that.

751
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:03,139
I'm thankful that our God has no respect of persons.

752
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,659
And we understand that the conduct of an elder

753
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,299
should be to pursue purity.

754
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,759
It should be to reject partiality.

755
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,659
Turn back to 1 Timothy chapter number five, if you will,

756
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:16,299
and we'll finish here with the matter of wine.

757
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:18,859
What an exciting subject, hallelujah.

758
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:22,099
1 Timothy chapter five,

759
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,099
notice what the Bible says in verse number 23.

760
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:26,819
It's dealing with the conduct of an elder.

761
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,979
In verse 23, I was gonna preach a whole message on this,

762
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:31,619
but we gotta get going through the whole of this book

763
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:32,739
and also the next.

764
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:36,179
But he says, drink no longer water,

765
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:39,499
but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake

766
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,939
and thine often infirmities.

767
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:44,099
Now, I wanna understand something this morning

768
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,239
as I begin to deal with this,

769
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,499
the conduct of an elder and addressing specifically

770
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:50,139
the matter of wine in this text of scripture.

771
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:53,639
There are two texts of scripture that often people will come

772
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,239
and they will present to someone

773
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,359
when they're trying to justify the use of alcohol.

774
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,359
One of them is this one.

775
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,719
The other is in John chapter two.

776
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,919
And here's what they say.

777
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,179
Well, Jesus turned water into wine.

778
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,239
And Paul told Timothy to drink a little wine.

779
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,719
And they'll use those two texts of scriptures

780
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,559
to justify their idea of drinking alcohol.

781
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,679
They forget that the Bible says

782
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,919
that we're to not look at the wine

783
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,839
when it moveth itself awry.

784
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,239
They forget to understand the truth

785
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,959
that wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.

786
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,959
Whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

787
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,839
And so there's a whole host of scriptures

788
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,159
that people ignore when they try to justify something.

789
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,559
Here's what I've said for years.

790
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,079
If you wanna justify something,

791
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,879
you're gonna figure out a way to do it.

792
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,299
If you wanna do something bad enough,

793
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,639
you're gonna figure out a way to justify it and to do it.

794
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,679
That's just the reality of human nature.

795
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,239
But as I look at this passage of scripture,

796
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,879
there are, or this verse of scripture

797
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:48,879
with regard to the use a little wine,

798
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,999
there are two key things that must be acknowledged.

799
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,719
Number one, do you notice where he says,

800
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:56,399
drink no longer water?

801
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:57,739
Do you see it in your Bible?

802
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,999
He says, drink no longer water.

803
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:03,519
Now, why would it be that Paul is instructing Timothy

804
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,859
to drink no longer water?

805
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,239
Have you ever traveled somewhere

806
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,799
where the water is not sanitary,

807
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:10,319
the water is not safe to drink?

808
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,099
So there are, when I went to Mexico,

809
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,679
they said, listen, whatever you do,

810
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,239
do not drink the water.

811
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,039
They said, don't use the water to brush your teeth.

812
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:20,719
Don't use the water, use a,

813
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,439
we had to use water bottles to brush our teeth

814
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:24,959
and clean off our toothbrush.

815
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:27,599
They said, listen, it'll make you sick.

816
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,279
It's not good.

817
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:30,599
Don't drink it.

818
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,599
So I was really careful.

819
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,479
And we're, it was like the last day we were there.

820
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,179
We're in this big room

821
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,839
and there's different shower units in this room.

822
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,799
And the one pastor that's there, all of a sudden,

823
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,239
we're all in there and he says, oh no.

824
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,639
And he kind of hollers out like that.

825
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,519
We're like, what in the world happened?

826
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,079
We thought there's a snake in there or something,

827
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,839
you know, I have no idea what happened.

828
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,559
And he said, I just used the water to swish out my mouth.

829
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,279
I'm gonna be so sick.

830
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:55,759
And he was like paranoid, right?

831
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,519
Right away, I'm gonna be so sick.

832
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,439
And the reality is that there are places

833
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,799
you can still travel today

834
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,639
where the water's not safe to drink.

835
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:07,199
How much more back then?

836
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:13,419
Timothy is given this instruction, drink no longer water.

837
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:14,759
But then I want you to notice another key

838
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:15,879
in the verse of scripture.

839
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:20,519
He says, for thy stomach's sake

840
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,599
and thine often infirmities.

841
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,479
So there are two keys that are given to us here.

842
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:28,159
Number one, drink no longer water.

843
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,279
The water was not safe.

844
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,279
The water was causing some difficulties.

845
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:34,119
By the way, if you drink water that's not sanitary,

846
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,319
if you're traveling abroad

847
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,279
and you partake of water that's not sanitary,

848
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:38,119
you know what it does?

849
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,759
It adversely affects your digestion.

850
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,879
It makes you sick, all right?

851
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,279
So he says, not only drink no longer water,

852
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,879
but he says in verse 23, for thy stomach's sake

853
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:53,479
and thine often infirmities.

854
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:57,839
Obviously, Timothy was dealing with an ongoing issue here.

855
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,439
And with this ongoing issue,

856
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:02,599
there is a piece of instruction that is given.

857
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,079
What is that instruction?

858
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,079
But use a little wine, use a little wine.

859
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,679
Now it's important for us to understand,

860
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,679
and I'm gonna ask this question this morning.

861
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,159
We believe that God is the creator God.

862
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:16,839
Do you believe that this morning?

863
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,679
You believe that God is the creator?

864
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:19,719
Do you believe that God is omniscient,

865
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,199
that he knows all things?

866
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:22,559
I believe that this morning.

867
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,719
Do you believe that God is the author of the Bible?

868
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:28,839
He says all scripture is given by inspiration of God

869
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,199
and is profitable, right?

870
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,479
All scripture, not most of it, not some of it,

871
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,919
but all of it.

872
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:35,679
Do you believe this morning

873
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,679
that God is smarter than Google?

874
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:42,639
You laugh.

875
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,859
You laugh, why?

876
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,419
You know how many people say, look at Google,

877
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:47,899
or they'll bring you some kind of thing and they'll say,

878
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:50,259
well, Google said, right?

879
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:52,859
Google is the, come on,

880
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,899
they run algorithms for all that stuff.

881
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:56,979
I'm not smart enough to understand how it all works,

882
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:58,339
but I am smart enough to know this,

883
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,779
God is smarter than Google.

884
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,179
Amen.

885
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:02,999
Amen.

886
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:04,819
Come on, you know it this morning.

887
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:06,759
He is the creator God.

888
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:09,019
Can I tell you what Google will tell you if you look up,

889
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,459
should I drink wine for my stomach?

890
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:12,679
Absolutely not.

891
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,519
It is the absolute worst thing you could do

892
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,519
if you have stomach issues is to drink alcohol.

893
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,919
It is the absolute, no doctor in their right mind

894
00:46:21,919 --> 00:46:25,039
would ever tell you to drink alcohol

895
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,279
if you have stomach issues.

896
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:28,319
All right, Google knows that.

897
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,159
You go look it up.

898
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,739
I got screenshots of it on my iPad, all right?

899
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:34,399
So if your Google says something different,

900
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,119
I got screenshots, amen?

901
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,799
But I under, listen, I've studied this out.

902
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,059
I've studied this out for years.

903
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:40,799
I preached a message years ago

904
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,479
called the deceitfulness of alcohol.

905
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:44,059
It's still on our website.

906
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:44,899
You can go listen to it.

907
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:45,799
It's a whole message on it.

908
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:48,959
But the reality is that no doctor

909
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:53,639
is ever going to prescribe to an individual

910
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,199
that has stomach issues to drink alcohol.

911
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,039
Furthermore, there's a study.

912
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:01,239
It came out just a couple of years ago.

913
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:02,079
I didn't bring it with me.

914
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:02,919
It's on my desk.

915
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:04,199
But there's a study that came out.

916
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,599
I saw it on Fox News a couple of years ago,

917
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,039
and I said, man, this is wonderful.

918
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,799
And I printed that thing out, saved it,

919
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:11,919
and it said this.

920
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,199
It said no person under 40 years old

921
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,039
should ever drink alcohol.

922
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,239
There are zero health benefits.

923
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,079
You should be a total abstainer.

924
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,319
Now, can I tell you this morning,

925
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:28,239
that's not popular with all the beer manufacturers

926
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:29,599
and all the alcohol, why?

927
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,319
There's a huge industry.

928
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,319
Those people make lots of money, okay?

929
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,599
So those studies are not popular,

930
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,719
but they came out with it,

931
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,519
and I have the article printed,

932
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:43,439
and it says there is zero, not there's some,

933
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:47,159
there are zero health benefits to alcohol.

934
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,039
Now, if scientists and if medicine

935
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,919
and if Google can figure all that stuff out in 2024,

936
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:57,079
I submit to you this morning that the creator God,

937
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,359
who is the omniscient God, knows all things,

938
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,679
and he never in his word would have told Paul

939
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,119
to give Timothy alcoholic beverage for his stomach's sake.

940
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,559
Not a chance.

941
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,039
So if you wanna find a verse

942
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:14,079
that's going to justify your behavior,

943
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,959
you can't use 1 Timothy 5 anymore, amen, honestly.

944
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:22,959
It's just not a valid interpretation of scripture.

945
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,679
I have found, however, and you cannot find this online

946
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:30,459
where it has been something that has been verified,

947
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:33,239
but I did some research years ago,

948
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,599
and I found this to be the case.

949
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,880
I read it in a couple of studies.

950
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,239
There are others that have come out and said,

951
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,399
no, it's not true,

952
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,760
but I can tell you that we've practiced it personally,

953
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,679
and that is this, that pure grape juice

954
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:49,679
is actually a huge benefit if you have stomach issues.

955
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,119
In fact, there are some studies that have suggested,

956
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,880
and again, they say that they're not verifiable.

957
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,479
They have suggested that if you are exposed

958
00:48:58,479 --> 00:48:59,559
to a stomach virus,

959
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:02,119
now, how many of you like stomach viruses?

960
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:02,959
Amen.

961
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:04,239
During that whole COVID thing,

962
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,440
everyone wanted to ask you about,

963
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,880
do you have this symptom, this symptom,

964
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,919
this symptom, this symptom,

965
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,079
and I was so like just wanting to mess with people

966
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:12,479
and say, man, I don't have any of that,

967
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:15,000
but I've been throwing up like crazy,

968
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,399
and I just got this,

969
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:17,679
because they didn't seem to care about

970
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,039
any of that sort of thing,

971
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,039
but I do not, Pierre, you know,

972
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:23,719
I hate the idea of a stomach bug.

973
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,659
It absolutely is the last thing I ever wanna have.

974
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,839
So as I was doing some study,

975
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:33,000
it said that pure grape juice can help,

976
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,239
and it can prevent, it can do all kinds of benefits

977
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,279
if you have gut things,

978
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,320
if you're exposed to some type of a stomach virus,

979
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,399
and so now in the man household,

980
00:49:41,399 --> 00:49:43,279
anytime there's a stomach bug that goes around,

981
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:46,039
the first thing we do, get the grape juice.

982
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:47,559
I mean, the pure stuff, man,

983
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,559
and can I tell you, we have seen the benefit of it,

984
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,599
personally.

985
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,

986
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm just an individual that did some study

987
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,239
and found out some things,

988
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,320
and I've suggested to other people.

989
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,279
My brother,

990
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:02,159
He said, man, the kid's got a stomach bug.

991
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,239
I said, you better go get some grape juice, man.

992
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:05,159
Just go get that stuff.

993
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:07,879
And it's helped us.

994
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,799
As I look at this passage of Scripture

995
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,999
and I find the conduct of an elder,

996
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:16,119
he says we're to pursue purity.

997
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,799
He says that we're to reject partiality.

998
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,719
And then he deals with the subject of wine

999
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,999
that's mixed right in the midst

1000
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,759
of this whole text of Scripture.

1001
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:26,879
But in the midst of speaking about wine,

1002
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:29,599
we can assuredly say this morning

1003
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,079
that there's no way that God Almighty,

1004
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,799
the creator and the all wise God,

1005
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:39,799
would have Paul tell Timothy to drink alcoholic beverage

1006
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,239
for his stomach's sake.

1007
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,519
No, the water was going to contribute further

1008
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,839
to his stomach issues, his often infirmities,

1009
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,839
and therefore drink no longer water.

1010
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:55,919
But use a little wine for thy stomach's sake

1011
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,759
and thine often infirmities.

1012
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:59,839
I'm thankful that God has given us

1013
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,039
every word of Scripture.

1014
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,519
Listen, the Bible says that every word of God is pure.

1015
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,479
See, God put all of verse 23 in there

1016
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:11,239
so that we could interpret it properly

1017
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,599
that Paul didn't just say, hey, don't drink any water,

1018
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,079
but drink wine, period.

1019
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,399
That would be open to all kinds

1020
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:20,399
of different interpretations and understandings.

1021
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:24,319
But he says, don't do it for this reason.

1022
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,599
And when we understand that reason,

1023
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,799
it helps us to come to a proper conclusion.

1024
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,399
This morning, we look at this passage of Scripture

1025
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,839
in 1 Timothy 5 and verse 17 through 25,

1026
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,919
and we see that in this passage

1027
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:40,759
it's dealing specifically with elders.

1028
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:42,759
But I said to you a few minutes ago,

1029
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:46,839
and I'll say it again, every child of God,

1030
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,119
their conduct should be honorable.

1031
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,439
It's not just honorable elders,

1032
00:51:52,439 --> 00:51:55,039
it should be honorable Christians.

1033
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:57,959
That we live in such a way

1034
00:51:57,959 --> 00:52:00,799
that we bring honor and glory to our God,

1035
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,039
that we are pursuing purity in our lives,

1036
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,599
that we are rejecting partiality,

1037
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,199
that we are understanding that there are things,

1038
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,759
behaviors that are appropriate and pleasing,

1039
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:16,039
and there are behaviors that are not appropriate,

1040
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,299
they're inappropriate, they're displeasing.

1041
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,839
As I mentioned to you at that conference,

1042
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:24,759
they said, if you do any of these things, you're out.

1043
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,599
No refund.

1044
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,319
Can I tell you that the sponsors

1045
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:31,559
and organizers of that conference,

1046
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:35,619
they're not our audience.

1047
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:40,719
God Almighty, the thrice holy God,

1048
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,879
He is the one that we serve.

1049
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:47,319
And oh, how our behavior should align biblically,

1050
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:49,679
that we can thank God for the encouragement

1051
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,719
that He gives us, we can thank God

1052
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,599
for the warnings that He provides,

1053
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,079
and we can thank God for the instruction that He gives.

1054
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:58,759
Can I tell you this morning?

1055
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:03,359
Instruction from God is only beneficial when it's applied.

1056
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:09,079
It's not enough to know it, to hear it.

1057
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:10,159
We must do it.

1058
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,299
We must pursue purity and reject partiality.

1059
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:14,139
Let's pray.

1060
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:15,079
Father, we love you.

1061
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:16,159
We thank you for loving us.

1062
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,559
We thank you for the opportunity to be gathered.

1063
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,239
Thank you for your word, the clarity of it.

1064
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,679
And God, I pray that you would help us this morning

1065
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,119
to submit ourselves to your word.

1066
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,839
We know that you're the all-wise God.

1067
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,559
We know, God, that you are holy and you're just,

1068
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:34,319
and we thank you for the instruction that you've provided.

1069
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,079
Help us, Lord, to pursue purity, to reject partiality.

1070
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,599
Help us to live and walk in such a way

1071
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,559
that you would be honored and glorified.

1072
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,959
God, if there's one here this morning

1073
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:48,459
that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray this morning

1074
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,899
they'd come to this old-fashioned altar,

1075
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:51,419
they'd allow us to take a Bible and show them

1076
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:53,859
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home,

1077
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,439
that they would not leave this place

1078
00:53:55,439 --> 00:54:00,099
without having 100% assurance that heaven is their home.

1079
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,539
I pray, God, that you'd move and work,

1080
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:02,659
that you'd be honored and glorified

1081
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:04,659
through all that's said and done.

1082
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,419
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
