00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
1 Timothy chapter number five.

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:03.119
Many of you know that we've been studying

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.559
through the book of 1 Timothy here on Sunday mornings

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.359
for the calendar year of 2024.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.520
And once we're finished with 1 Timothy,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.159
we'll go right into 2 Timothy.

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.640
Our theme for this year is continue.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.360
And we see that thought and that theme throughout this book

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920
and both books, 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.319
and we're very thankful for the opportunity

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.780
that we have to be able to study

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.239
this portion of scripture this morning.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.479
This letter, as you know, those who have been here,

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.240
and for those of you that have not,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
we'll get into the text this morning,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.880
but this letter from Paul to Timothy

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.959
provides encouragement.

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:41.880
We all need encouragement, don't we?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.720
And there are times in this life

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.080
that it can become overwhelming

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.819
and we need to receive encouragement.

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:51.360
We find that Timothy was left in Ephesus with a great task.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.000
And that task was at times overwhelming.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.360
He's dealing with false teachers

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.119
and all sorts of things that are going on.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.639
And we find that God would use Paul to write this letter,

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.119
of course, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.400
to give encouragement to his man,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.480
to his servant to continue.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.120
We find not only does this letter provide encouragement,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.760
but it provides a warning.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.680
And by the way, we all need encouragement,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
but there are times that we all need warnings.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.040
And I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.480
in the book of Psalms in the 19th chapter,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.040
that by them speaking of God's word

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.599
and how thankful I am for the word

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.160
is thy servant warned.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.040
And in keeping of them is great reward.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.639
You have many things in your house today

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.839
that have warning labels on them.

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:37.919
You drive, you drove here this morning

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.400
and you saw various signs.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.160
And at times you see warning about something that's ahead,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.879
something that you're going to face.

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.220
And we find that there are warnings in life,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
but God also in his word has provided us with warnings

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440
and oh, how thankful I am for the encouragement.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.599
Oh, how thankful I am for the warnings.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.919
We also find that God gives instruction

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:02.760
and oh, how we need instruction.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.699
I know that many of us men,

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:06.599
we've tried to put things together before

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.860
without the instructions.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.399
And maybe we've come to a place

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.720
where we've gotten frustrated.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.880
We thought what's going on?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.320
Is it written in a different language?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.360
Is it upside down?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.119
Who wrote these instructions?

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.639
And we set them to the side and say,

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.160
we're gonna just do it ourselves.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.580
And if you do it, like I do it,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.080
you get to do it two or three times by yourself.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.639
And find those instructions that you set aside

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.839
and realize humbly that I probably

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.199
should take these instructions

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.600
because whoever wrote them knows more than I do.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.559
You know, God gave us a wonderful book.

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.880
He is the omniscient God.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.979
He's the all wise God.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.399
He knows more than all of us together.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.880
And he has given us instruction in his word

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.639
and oh, how we need the instruction and how blessed we are.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.000
Timothy was ministering there in Ephesus.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.100
He had a great responsibility.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.179
I mentioned already that the false teachers,

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.660
they were active and Timothy needed

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.380
to withstand their activity.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.619
He needed to withstand their false teaching.

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.460
He needed to guide the members of the church

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.339
in the way that they ought to go.

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.979
We find that the members of that church

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.619
needed to understand how they were to properly behave

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.440
and also interact one with another.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.740
We find that throughout this letter,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.979
as we've mentioned in previous messages,

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:23.220
that God gives instruction for behavior in his house

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.539
and how we are to behave ourselves.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.139
There is behavior that is appropriate

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.979
and there's behavior that's inappropriate.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.619
I was at a conference this past week

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.339
and I was at that conference and they listed

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.179
right on all the instruction after you registered

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.100
to go to that conference.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.820
It said, by the way, at the bottom of it,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.039
it said, if you do this, this, or this,

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.339
you will be escorted immediately.

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.179
And I thought, well, there is behavior for this conference

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.919
that's appropriate and acceptable

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.320
and there is behavior for this conference

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.860
that is not going to be tolerated

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.139
and they put it right there in black and white letters.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.059
If you do these things, you are out

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.979
and by the way, no refund.

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.940
And they weren't playing games.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.500
And what I say to you this morning

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.460
is that the house of God is a sacred place.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.339
It's a holy place as his people are gathered together

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.979
as we pray for his presence to be with us,

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.500
that we desire to worship him in spirit and in truth,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.980
that there is behavior that is appropriate and acceptable

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.660
and there is behavior that is not well-pleasing to God.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.160
And we find here this morning that through this book

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.380
that God has given not only encouragement

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.940
and warning and instruction,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.640
we benefit just as Timothy did,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.380
just as the church in Ephesus did,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.059
we today benefit from all of these things.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.619
And I'm thankful this morning

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:47.019
that the Lord is the head of the church, it's his church.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.579
It's not my church, it's not your church, it's his church.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:53.779
And he promises that he will build his church

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.739
and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.380
By the way, that's a promise that's made in Matthew 16

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.220
that we can stand upon, that we can trust

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.100
and that we can rejoice in

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.899
and knowing that he is king of kings

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.260
and Lord of lords, he's on his throne.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.899
We sang this morning, Jesus saves,

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.540
and what a joy to know that he does.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.660
I wanna remind you that he's coming back again.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.200
I don't know when he's coming,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.339
but I'm looking forward to hearing the trumpet of the Lord.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.380
Amen, in time shall be no more.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.299
We're gonna go be with our Lord and savior.

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:29.700
He's the head of the church.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.940
As the head of the church,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.679
he has graciously instructed his church.

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.480
Not only the church here in Ephesus

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.480
that Timothy had the responsibility to lead and to guide,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.119
but we find that God has providentially preserved his word

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.000
so that every church throughout the era

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.760
of the church history would have the instruction

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.100
so that we would know how we are to behave,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.700
so that we would know how we're to interact one with another

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.000
so that we would understand how we can please the Lord.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.320
I don't wanna be in a position as a church,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720
as an individual, as a family.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.679
I don't wanna be in a position

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:11.079
where God would look at my life as an individual,

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.799
our home as a family, our church corporately,

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:16.760
and say, I am not pleased.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.799
No, I long for God to be pleased with my life

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:22.640
and with us as a church.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.600
I do not want, as you would read in the Old Testament,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.600
Ichabod written that the glory of the Lord hath departed.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.880
No, we serve a risen God.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.839
He lives.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.279
We sang it this morning.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.839
And what a joy to know that he is the head of our church

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.920
and he has given us instruction

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.040
that when that instruction is followed,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.420
it enables us to please him.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.399
A few weeks ago, we started 1 Timothy chapter number five,

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.519
and the first section of this particular book

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.880
addresses relationships in the church,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.920
and it deals with the senior saints and the younger saints,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.239
and it deals with widows.

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:01.339
And we studied that portion of scripture

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.459
beginning in verse number one down through verse number 16.

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:05.880
We mentioned that the senior saints

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.220
are referenced as being the elder in verses one and two,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.160
and that's not the office of the elder, the pastor.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.220
That is just those that were older

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.059
that I've referred to as being senior saints.

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:19.839
You say, pastor, I'm a senior saint.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.019
You figure it out.

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.660
I'm not going there, amen?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.739
But the reality is that there are, in every good church,

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:31.459
a church that should have different ages

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:33.059
of people in the church.

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:35.179
There should be some senior saints,

00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:37.500
but there should be some new believers.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.459
And everywhere in between, why?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.540
Because we're pressing forward for the cause of Christ

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.859
to reach a lost and dying world.

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.619
We find that the chapter concludes

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:48.420
beginning in verse number 17

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.299
down through the end of the chapter in verse number 25

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:53.980
with instruction regarding elders.

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:57.059
Now, this is the office of a pastor

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.100
that is being referenced.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.899
You'll recall, maybe you were here several weeks ago

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.899
as we studied there in chapter number three,

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:08.019
and the Bible says, this is a true saying

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:11.540
in verse number one, if a man desire the office of a bishop,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.619
he desireth a good work.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.000
And we mentioned as we studied

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.299
through that portion of scripture

00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:19.140
that God uses these terms in his word

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.779
of bishop and elder interchangeably,

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:26.500
and they refer to the same office that we refer to today

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.619
as being the office of the pastor.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.459
And we find that the instruction is given

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:32.900
when he begins in verse number 17,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.539
let the elders that rule well

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.780
be counted worthy of double honor,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.179
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.299
for the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:45.940
that treadeth out the corn,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.780
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.299
Notice again in verse 19,

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:54.940
against an elder received an accusation,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.419
but before two or three witnesses.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:59.780
And so we find that in verse number 17,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.419
and then again in verse number 19,

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:04.260
that he addresses in this section,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.539
the elder, the pastor of the church.

00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:08.539
I've titled the message this morning,

00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:12.979
Honorable Elders, Honorable Elders.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:15.020
I only have two points for you this morning,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.020
but don't get excited.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.179
That doesn't mean the message will be any shorter.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.299
And the reality is that many of you take notes

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:23.140
and you get used to having three points

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.979
throughout the message.

00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:25.739
This morning, we have two thoughts for you.

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:27.219
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:30.140
the compensation for an elder,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.739
the compensation for an elder.

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:32.900
I read verse 17 and 18.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.940
Let me read them again for you.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.460
The Bible says, let the elders that rule well

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.900
be counted worthy of double honor,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.140
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.780
for the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.380
that treadeth out the corn,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.979
and the laborer is worthy of his reward.

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.460
As we're gonna look at this passage of scripture again,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.780
God is giving to the church at Ephesus

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.659
to Timothy as its leader,

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:59.179
instruction for behavior in the church,

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.580
that which pleases the Lord.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.140
the Lord, that which does not please the Lord. He deals in the beginning of the

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.500
chapter the interactions between the senior saints, the younger believers. He

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.020
deals extensively in this chapter with widows, and then he comes to the subject

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.540
of dealing with the elders. He begins in verses 17 and 18 by dealing with the

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.660
compensation for an elder. Before we really deal with the compensation, I

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.860
want you to understand that the pastor has a responsibility. The responsibility

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.300
the pastor is dictated for us here. Notice the Bible says, let the elders

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.740
that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, but then notice the end of

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:43.820
the verse, especially they who, do you see the word labor? In word and doctrine. The

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.300
end of verse number 18, the laborer is worthy of his reward. The pastor has a

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.700
responsibility to labor in the word and in doctrine. It is my God-given

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.380
responsibility. When God called me to be a pastor, when God placed that call upon

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.800
my life, He gave me responsibility, and the responsibility is great. The

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:13.980
responsibility to feed the flock of God. What a joy that I have. I thoroughly

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.180
enjoy preaching and teaching God's Word. Sometimes, if we're not careful, we could

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.660
think that that's the only aspect of pastoring. It really is just the most

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.940
public aspect of the ministry of being a pastor, but we find that it's such an

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.140
important aspect. The pastor has a responsibility to labor in the word and

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.700
in doctrine. We find that it's so imperative that we understand this

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.140
morning that the pastor, that as I personally have the opportunity to

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.940
fulfill that role at Fellowship Baptist Church, that it is laboring in God's Word.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.380
Someone asked me years ago, they came to me and they meant it as a compliment, and

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.140
they said this, pastor, those messages that you've preached have been very

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.500
helpful. I very much enjoy them. Are you getting them from a book? And I said, yes,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.020
the Bible. And the reality is that I study, and I'm not patting myself on the

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:13.340
back, it is my God-given responsibility to dig into the Word of God and to

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:20.100
provide the flock of God with truth, with doctrine, that which is going to

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:25.020
help, that which is going to build up so that we might be sound in the faith.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:30.300
That's my responsibility. That is a pastor's responsibility. We find that

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.900
that's not the end of the responsibility, but with regard to the context of what

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.300
we're looking at here, we find that he speaks about this laboring in word and

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.100
in doctrine. I like the fact that he uses the word labor because it is work. It is

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.660
work. And there are times I've been asked this question, how long does it take to

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.420
prepare a message? And the reality is that it varies. Sometimes a message can

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.460
come to you real quick. I mean, God just, man, He just gives...other times it is

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:04.820
just...it is work. And someone asked me, what do you do all week? I said, well, how

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.860
about you come and visit with me all week? And you can shadow me all week. It's

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.460
an open invitation. You can be with me. And then if you want to preach four

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.220
times next week, you go ahead and do it. You get to prepare four lessons next week.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:23.020
And it's labor. Listen, I'm not interested in giving some cheap meal to our church.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.100
I'm just not. The reality is that you can have, I think, about often this context of

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.740
feeding the flock of God. And I like home-cooked meals. I much prefer home-cooked

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.900
meals over frozen entrees. Amen? I like fresh home-cooked meals more than I like

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.740
leftovers. Now, I'll eat leftovers because I don't want to waste it, but I like it

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.540
when there's no leftovers. Why? Because that means there's another fresh meal

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:54.580
tomorrow. Amen? Joseph hates leftovers. I mean, he just...last...the week before they

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.140
went to camp, it seemed like every day we had leftovers. And Holly said, what do you

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:04.380
want for lunch? I said, I do not want any more leftovers. I am leftovered out.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:11.580
Listen, this book is a living book. This Word will help you and it will help me.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.660
And every time I come to the pulpit, I want to come with a fresh truth that God

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:23.820
has given to us with a measure of excitement. Why? Because this is God's Word

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:29.020
and it's a living book. This is not dead orthodoxy. This is not religion. And we

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.780
were knocking doors, Ronnie and I knocking doors, not yesterday, but last Saturday.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.700
And some man says, well, you know, just to be honest with you, I'm not a religious

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.820
person. Isn't that what he said, Ronnie? And I said, well, sir, neither am I. And he

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.500
said, I don't believe you. He put his hand on his hip and he said, I don't believe

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.180
you. And I just introduced myself as being from the church. And he said, you've got

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.980
to be a religious person. Religion. I'm not interested in religion. I'm

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:01.300
interested in relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. And what a joy to know that

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:07.940
he lives and he lives within me. And it's real. It's not just dead orthodoxy. And I

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.260
desire to fulfill the responsibility. I know. Listen, I'm not the greatest

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.860
preacher I don't ever claim to be, but I want to give God's Word. It's the

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.300
responsibility. But let me say this, not only does the pastor have a responsibility,

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.860
the church has a responsibility. He says in verse number 18, notice what he says,

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.620
for the scripture saith. This is a biblical truth. This is not just Timothy,

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.980
Paul's opinion that he's given to Timothy. He says, this is a, the scripture saith.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.180
This is a biblical truth. By the way, when he uses this phrase and says, for the

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.980
scripture saith, he references really two verses of scripture. Thou shall not muzzle

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.020
the ox that treadeth out the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his reward. We're

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.060
not going to take the time, but if you went back to Deuteronomy 25 in verse

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.900
number four, and if you went back to Luke chapter 10 in verse number seven, those

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.660
are the two references that are given to us in verse number 18. And we find that

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.220
Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, refers to both of those as

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.620
being scripture. And that's an important thing for us to understand. I'm so

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.420
thankful for the scripture, for the word of God, for thus saith the Lord. And so

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.060
what does he say? He says that the, in verse number 17, let the elders that rule

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.540
well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.060
doctrine. For the scripture saith, thou shall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.100
the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his reward. We find that the pastor,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.580
indeed, it's certainly to be noted that the pastor is not to be greedy, a filthy

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.700
lucre. The Bible gives that as a requirement in 1 Timothy 3. In verse

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.500
number 3, he again says it in 1 Peter chapter 5, in verse number 2. But we

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.060
understand this morning that the pastor must be compensated in order to provide

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.220
for his family. It just is what it is. Now, I'll be honest with you, this is one

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.660
of the hardest subjects for me to ever preach on. It really is. It's a difficult

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.100
subject, being the pastor of the church. This is an easy passage to preach from if

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.700
I'm preaching somewhere else, just to be honest with you, because it's a biblical

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.060
truth. Why do I say it's a difficult thing? Because people hear what they want

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.700
to hear. They receive what they want to receive. They think, assume what they want

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.380
to assume. And so let me be very clear this morning, before I say anything more,

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.460
I would like to say this. Fellowship Baptist Church has been good to us,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.500
and I appreciate that. It's been a blessing to our family. But I want you to

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.700
understand that not all churches have this understanding, not all churches have

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.380
this perspective. I know churches right now that need pastors. In our state of

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.900
Virginia, our Commonwealth of Virginia, there are churches that need pastors.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.340
You begin to talk to those churches, you say, well, what are you going to be able

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.940
to compensate them? Well, we just can't pay them. Well, how do you want somebody

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.140
to come and minister? What do you want them to do? Well, we can pay them $25,000.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.260
Can you live on $25,000 a year? I'm just being honest with you. And it's one of

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.380
those things you begin to look at and you say, listen, the pastor, he has a responsibility,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:15.420
but the church has a responsibility. And we understand that this is what God's plan is.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.060
This is God's truth that He's given to us. Look at a few verses of Scripture with me.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.300
Turn to the book of Romans, if you will. It's not just a truth that's just isolated here

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.620
to the book of 1 Timothy. Over the book of Romans, in chapter 15, we're going to look

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.500
at three other portions of Scripture very quickly this morning. And again, I've mentioned

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.500
already to preface it by saying fellowship after church has been good to us, and we've been blessed,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:46.220
and I am thankful, and I appreciate the spirit and the attitude of our church family. But the

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:52.780
reality is that not everyone has this understanding. For generations, the idea of many churches was

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:58.220
that the pastor should be poor. That's just the reality. That was the perspective of a lot of

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:05.820
people. And the reality is that God has given a responsibility. Notice in Romans 15, in verse 27,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.900
they have pleased them verily, and their debtors they are. Notice this,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.220
for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, notice what it says,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:26.860
their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. So we see this distinction

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.260
between spiritual things and carnal things. The spiritual things, that's the responsibility of

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:37.340
the pastor. That's the responsibility of the leader of the church with regard to the office

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.980
of a pastor in the context of what we're dealing with, that we are to minister. Listen, they're

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:48.780
partakers of spiritual things, but then it says their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.820
things. I've heard people say this over the years, well, the pastor can just go get a job.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:00.380
He can, absolutely. But do you know how that changes the ministry of the pastor?

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.700
Honestly, it changes.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.020
The pastor is working a full-time job somewhere else so that he can provide for his family.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.940
By the way, he has a Biblical responsibility to provide for his family.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.080
Amen?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.100
He has a Biblical responsibility.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.660
If he doesn't provide for his family, he's worse than an infidel.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.900
We read that last time we were in 1 Timothy chapter 5, and so there's a Biblical responsibility.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.060
Oh, well, the pastor can go to a job.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.420
He can.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.500
But if the pastor's working 40, 50 hours a week, how available do you think he is to

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.140
prepare messages?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.860
How available do you think he is when you pick up the phone and say, hey, I have a ... And

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.860
you get voicemail.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.860
You get no call back.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860
Why?

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.860
Because he's at work.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.860
It's just the way it is.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.860
I know a pastor friend down in the Richmond area, and he's pastor of the church for 27

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860
years now.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.340
But he shared this story with me, he's about to retire, and he shared this story with me

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.580
when he first got there to pastor.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.380
They just flat out did not pay him like they should have or like they could have.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.380
The finances were there.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.820
It wasn't a matter of not having the ability, it was just that they chose not to.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.940
And so after being there for about two months, he realized, I'm going in debt.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.300
I can't cover the expenses of my family that's more expensive to live here than I thought

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.300
it was going to be.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.860
And he put all these numbers together and he went and he had a meeting with the men

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.580
of the church after a Sunday morning.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.980
And here's what he said, folks, I just want you to know, I'm going tomorrow to get a job.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.460
He said, what do you mean you're getting a job?

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.340
Well, here's what you're paying me and here's what my expenses are and I just can't survive.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.900
He didn't ask for them to pay him anymore.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.900
He didn't demand that they pay them anymore.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.220
He just simply said, I got to go get a job.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.840
And then he asked this question.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.860
He said, I just want to know how many of you could live here on that salary.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.340
And they said, pastor, would you be dismissed?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.940
And they decided that day that they were going to pay him like they should have, like they

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.660
could have, so that he didn't have to go get another job.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.460
Here's the Lord.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:22:00.380
But the reality is that it's a biblical responsibility, these carnal things, and it's a mindset that

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.460
sometimes people have, well, you can just go get a job.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.540
Well, it affects the whole ministry.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.260
There are some pastors that are bivocational, just the way it has to be.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:15.500
And that's a sad situation when it has to be that way because you can't do both well.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.940
First Corinthians chapter number nine, notice what the Bible says in this portion of Scripture.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.800
In First Corinthians nine, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, and he's giving

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.500
the same truth that he mentioned to those in Rome.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.340
He says in verse 11 of First Corinthians nine, if we have sown unto you spiritual things,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.820
is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.980
Again, he uses these two terms of spiritual and carnal.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.740
He's not using the word carnal in Romans or here in First Corinthians as being a bad thing.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.980
Like he says to them, you're carnal, you can't receive these things.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.860
That's a negative connotation.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:57.080
But when he's talking here, he's talking about the things that we need to live, to survive.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.480
Most of you are not going to go to work for free, amen?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.400
Most of you, when you got a job wherever you're working, you found out what you were going

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.300
to be compensated, amen?

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.300
You did.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.820
I didn't.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.820
I didn't ask the question.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.380
When I came to pastor this church, I had zero idea what I was going to get paid.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.639
I'm just being honest.

00:23:17.639 --> 00:23:21.760
Those men that were here the day that I accepted the position, they can verify that.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.480
I did not know.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.800
Every year that I've been here, Doc was the treasurer for years, then Jared, and then

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.380
now Pierre, and Dean is one of our deacons, been a deacon since I've been here.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.400
Every year, and these men, Jared's not here anymore, he moved to South Carolina, but they

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.040
can verify every year they would come to me and say, pastor, what do you need to make?

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040
What do you need for a pay raise?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.800
I've never answered the question.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.200
Not one time.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.800
When I worked in the corporate world, I got everything I could get.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.960
I'm just being honest with you.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.200
When I worked in the corporate world, I got everything I could get.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.100
I negotiated.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:07.360
It's different in the spiritual world, but the pastor still has needs.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.940
Some of you have paid for college for your children.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.960
Don't you think a pastor wants to pay for college for his children?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.000
Again, don't take this as a negative to our church.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.480
The church has been great to us.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.720
It's a biblical truth that unfortunately there are churches today that they don't understand

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.119
it.

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:30.500
They think this, the pastor's just in it for the money.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.000
There are some that are.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.959
There are some that are, and it's terrible.

00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:41.040
They ought not be in that position, but can I tell you because there are some that are,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.080
it doesn't mean all are.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.520
There are some that are laboring in the word and in doctrine, and they are, as we've titled

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.360
the message this morning, honorable elders.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.040
In Galatians chapter 6, a third reference that God gives us with regard to this subject

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.059
matter, and we'll move right along.

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:10.440
Notice in Galatians 6 and verse number 6, let him that is taught in the word communicate

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.959
unto him that teacheth in all good things.

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:21.080
It's the same principle that we saw in the book of Romans, in the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.080
Now if you understand the book of Galatians, there's not a church in Galatia that's being

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.080
written to.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.559
There are four churches in the region of Galatia that were established during the first missionary

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.619
journey.

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:37.239
Now we see it in 1 Timothy with regard to the instruction to the church and to Timothy

00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:43.160
there in Ephesus, and so we find that this is a biblical truth, this is a biblical responsibility.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.440
I've had the privilege of working with new pastors that are starting churches, and can

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.959
I tell you it's a difficult thing when you've got to start talking about money.

00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:54.040
It's just complicated, it's difficult.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.520
I didn't have any problem in the corporate world, but it's different in the church setting.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.119
And I've talked to pastors, I said, listen, you are robbing your church of their God-given

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:10.279
responsibility to compensate you, because it is a God-given responsibility.

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.820
Well, we just want to support more missionaries.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.540
It's great to support more missionaries, but you better take care of your pastor.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.000
It's a responsibility that God has given.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.520
So we see, first of all, the compensation for an elder.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.520
Number two, I want you to notice in this passage of Scripture the conduct of an elder, the

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520
conduct of an elder.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.880
Now as we look at the rest of the text, beginning in verse 19 down through verse 25, we find

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.720
that God is going to deal with the conduct.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.720
Now listen, the qualifications for an elder are detailed in 1 Timothy chapter 3.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.480
We see them in the book of Titus as well, but we've studied them, and we said that the

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.820
qualifications are given.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.520
These aren't just, we would like it if you had, no, these are qualifications, he must

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520
be.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520
All right?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.320
That's the verbiage that is used repeatedly.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:01.119
And so we see the qualifications are outlined in detail in 1 Timothy chapter number 3.

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:07.440
In 1 Timothy chapter number 5, we find that we are provided with some practical instruction

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.920
regarding the conduct of an elder.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.839
Let me remind you, I mentioned in 1 Peter chapter 5 in verse number 2, you don't need

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:19.080
to turn there, but it talks about filthy lucre or those that are there for lucre, but we

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:25.160
find that it also says in verse number 3 that the elder or the pastor is an ensample to

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.279
the flock, an ensample to the flock.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:34.360
It's a sad thing this morning that there are some elders, even here in recent days,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.040
that have been exposed for some great wickedness.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:44.520
I know an elder, a pastor, that sat in a courtroom after he was charged with heinous crimes,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.559
and he sat in that courtroom and he said this quote when he gave an answer to the judge,

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:53.760
I did not know I was breaking the law.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.980
I will not tell you what the man was guilty of doing.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.660
It is absolutely immoral and egregious, but he said to the judge, I did not know I was

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.899
breaking the law.

00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:04.899
What was he referring to?

00:28:04.899 --> 00:28:11.420
He was referring to the law of the land, but I want you to know he was breaking God's law.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:17.899
Regardless of what the law of the land was, he was breaking God's law.

00:28:17.899 --> 00:28:21.860
And listen, the Bible says in the book of Romans, hey, you that teach that you shouldn't

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.860
steal, do you steal?

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.260
No, it doesn't work that way.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:32.419
The conduct of an elder is of great importance, and he is to be an example to the flock.

00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:35.859
We see here in the text of Scripture a couple of things that we want to note.

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:40.900
Number one, an elder should pursue purity.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.099
An elder should pursue purity.

00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:44.099
And I'm going to say this at the end.

00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:46.380
I'll say it now, I'll say it again at the end.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.580
These truths that we're looking at with regard to the conduct of an elder are not just isolated

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.859
for elders.

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:56.500
Every child of God should pursue purity.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.660
Because every man that hath this hope, what hope according to 1 John 3, that Jesus is

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.900
coming again, he maketh himself pure even as he is pure.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.700
So this idea of pursuing purity is not just something that's reserved for the elder, for

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.440
the pastor of the church, but we find that all of God's people should pursue purity.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.260
We see that, look in verse number 19, it talks about dealing with sin in verses 19 and 20.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:39.619
Now, we understand that no person, pastor, elder, church person, no individual saved

00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:44.500
by the grace of God person is ever going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.500
Amen?

00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:51.419
And listen, I'm thankful this morning that I have been saved and I have been delivered

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:57.299
from the power of sin and from the penalty of sin, but I have not yet been delivered

00:29:57.299 --> 00:29:59.299
from the presence of sin.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.419
One day, one glorious day.

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:03.419
I'm going to go to heaven, and I don't know when that's going to be,

00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:05.419
but I'm looking forward to going to heaven.

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:07.419
And guess what? There is no sin in heaven.

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:11.419
I am so thankful we will be delivered from the very presence of sin.

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:15.419
Actively right now, sin no longer has power over me.

00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:18.419
Why? Because I've been saved by the grace of God.

00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:22.419
I'm no longer bound by the power of sin.

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:25.419
Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:29.419
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:31.419
Listen, it's not a valid thing to say, I just didn't have a choice.

00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:34.419
No, you did have a choice.

00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:39.419
Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:42.419
But we're never going to be sinless.

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:45.419
Okay? We're never going to be sinless.

00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:50.419
But we find here that as we look at this passage of Scripture with this pursuit of purity,

00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:56.419
it should be that our desire as we walk with Christ is that we sin less and less.

00:30:56.419 --> 00:31:00.419
That we don't get comfortable with sin in our lives, for any child of God.

00:31:00.419 --> 00:31:04.419
But especially as we look at the context here with regard to a pastor, an elder,

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:08.419
he says, then that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear.

00:31:08.419 --> 00:31:12.419
Listen, the pastor is not above the law.

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:16.419
It should never be thought of that way. It should never be presented that way.

00:31:16.419 --> 00:31:19.419
No, listen, how many of you, and I know we've got some police officers here, and that's fine.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:21.419
I don't mean to offend you.

00:31:21.419 --> 00:31:24.419
But the reality is, some of the times you get irritated with a police officer

00:31:24.419 --> 00:31:28.419
that's going 95 miles an hour down the road, and then he wants to pull you over for going 72.

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:30.419
You're like, what's up with that?

00:31:30.419 --> 00:31:33.419
Now, I haven't gotten pulled over recently, praise the Lord, so I'm not nothing.

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:35.419
But I'm just saying, it's frustrating. Why?

00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:39.419
Because the police officer's acting like he's above the law. Right?

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:42.419
He has this little badge that he can show his body, and he can get away.

00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:46.419
It doesn't always happen that way, but I'm saying it can be a frustrating thing.

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:49.419
The pastor is not above the law.

00:31:49.419 --> 00:31:54.419
The pastor is more accountable to whom much is given, much is required.

00:31:54.419 --> 00:32:00.419
And we find that a pastor, an honorable elder, he should be pursuing purity.

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:04.419
And we deal with sin. We see it in verses 19 and 20.

00:32:04.419 --> 00:32:06.419
We find, notice in verse 21,

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:09.419
I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels

00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:12.419
that thou observe these things without preferring one before another,

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.419
doing nothing by partiality.

00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:16.419
Notice in verse 22, lay hands suddenly on no man,

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:20.419
neither be partaker of other men's sins.

00:32:20.419 --> 00:32:25.419
Notice these three words, keep thyself pure.

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:28.419
Listen, there are some things that you need to do in your life.

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:32.419
There are some fences that you need to put up in your life to preserve purity

00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:34.419
as you're pursuing purity.

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:37.419
A fence doesn't, it serves two purposes.

00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:39.419
A fence is not just to keep you in.

00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:45.419
You know how many young people have the idea that fences are just to keep you in?

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:48.419
I want to do, but my parents won't let me.

00:32:48.419 --> 00:32:51.419
No, no, the fences, the warnings, they don't only just keep you in,

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:54.419
but they keep evil out.

00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:56.419
And it's a blessing.

00:32:56.419 --> 00:32:59.419
And here he says, keep thyself pure.

00:32:59.419 --> 00:33:02.419
We mentioned already in 1 John chapter 3, verses 1 through 3,

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:06.419
we believe that Jesus is coming again, and if we have that belief,

00:33:06.419 --> 00:33:10.419
we are to purify ourselves even as he is pure.

00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:14.419
And so we find, notice in verse 24 specifically,

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:18.419
it says this, some men's sins are open beforehand,

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:21.419
going before the judgment, and some men they follow after.

00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:25.419
Likewise, also verse 25, the good works of some are manifest beforehand,

00:33:25.419 --> 00:33:28.419
and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.419
What's he saying in verse 24 and 25?

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:33.419
Listen, sometimes you can see the wickedness from a mile away.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:37.419
Sometimes people have gotten clever on how to cover it up.

00:33:37.419 --> 00:33:39.419
But can I remind you of a secret?

00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:41.419
It's really not a secret.

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:44.419
You can't cover anything from God.

00:33:44.419 --> 00:33:46.419
You can try.

00:33:46.419 --> 00:33:53.419
But Proverbs says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:55.419
Shall not prosper.

00:33:55.419 --> 00:33:59.419
Whoso confesseth and forsaketh, well then, they're going to find mercy.

00:33:59.419 --> 00:34:01.419
Why? Because we have a merciful God.

00:34:01.419 --> 00:34:02.419
We have a gracious God.

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:06.419
We have a God that the Bible says that with thee there is forgiveness.

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:09.419
Hallelujah.

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:13.419
I remember Rachel there in the book of Genesis.

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:20.419
She knew that she had the stuff in the tent.

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:23.419
What about as you look at Achan?

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:26.419
The troubler of Israel is referred to in the book of 1 Chronicles.

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:28.419
He knew that he had stuff in the tent.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:32.419
He took of the accursed thing.

00:34:32.419 --> 00:34:38.419
I want you to know that though they knew and they hid, that God exposed.

00:34:38.419 --> 00:34:44.419
There's a truth in the book of Numbers that says be sure your sin will find you out.

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:47.419
The reality is that sometimes you can see it from a mile away.

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:50.419
Sometimes people are not really good at covering things up.

00:34:50.419 --> 00:34:52.419
But you can't hide from God.

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:54.419
You can't hide from God.

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:58.419
God knows, he sees, he's everywhere present.

00:34:58.419 --> 00:35:02.419
The reality this morning is that the truth of God being everywhere present

00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:06.419
is a truth that causes me to have great comfort,

00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:09.419
but it also should bring great conviction because he's everywhere.

00:35:09.419 --> 00:35:12.419
He's with you.

00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:14.419
And we're to pursue purity.

00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:18.419
Not only pursue purity, but number two, when we talk about the conduct of an elder,

00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:20.419
we should pursue purity.

00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:23.419
We should reject partiality.

00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:25.419
Reject partiality.

00:35:25.419 --> 00:35:27.419
Notice what the Bible says in verse 21.

00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:30.419
Really this idea of partial or being partial to someone

00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:33.419
or this idea of partiality as being a respecter of persons.

00:35:33.419 --> 00:35:35.419
And we're to be no respecter of persons.

00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:38.419
Verse 21, it says, I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ

00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:41.419
and the elect angels that thou observe these things,

00:35:41.419 --> 00:35:45.419
notice, without preferring one another, one before another,

00:35:45.419 --> 00:35:49.419
notice doing nothing by partiality.

00:35:49.419 --> 00:35:52.419
This is a Bible word that's a good word.

00:35:52.419 --> 00:35:55.419
We're to not be a respecter of persons.

00:35:55.419 --> 00:36:00.419
A minister, a pastor, every child of God

00:36:00.419 --> 00:36:05.419
ought to understand this morning that we are all made in the image of God.

00:36:05.419 --> 00:36:08.419
Do you believe that this morning?

00:36:08.419 --> 00:36:10.419
God is the creator.

00:36:10.419 --> 00:36:12.419
And we have been made in his image.

00:36:12.419 --> 00:36:14.419
And God so loved who?

00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.419
The world.

00:36:16.419 --> 00:36:18.419
Every person.

00:36:18.419 --> 00:36:23.419
And we find that here, he says, let nothing be done by partiality.

00:36:23.419 --> 00:36:25.419
And we're to reject partiality,

00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:30.419
a word that's so often that would be used in our vernacular today is racism.

00:36:30.419 --> 00:36:32.419
And we see it in our society.

00:36:32.419 --> 00:36:34.419
We see the divide that it causes.

00:36:34.419 --> 00:36:36.419
But I want you to understand as a child of God,

00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:39.419
there should be no level of racism whatsoever.

00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:41.419
Why?

00:36:41.419 --> 00:36:43.419
Because we're all of one blood.

00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:45.419
We're all made in the image of God.

00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:48.419
We're all valuable in God's sight.

00:36:48.419 --> 00:36:52.419
And we must understand this morning that it's absolutely imperative

00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:55.419
that we look at the conduct of an elder

00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:58.419
and we say not only is he to pursue purity,

00:36:58.419 --> 00:37:04.419
but he is to reject partiality.

00:37:04.419 --> 00:37:08.419
Not partial to anyone on any basis.

00:37:08.419 --> 00:37:09.419
Amen?

00:37:09.419 --> 00:37:11.419
That's the biblical truth.

00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:14.419
By the way, it's not just a biblical truth for the pastor.

00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:16.419
It's a biblical truth for every child of God.

00:37:16.419 --> 00:37:18.419
Look at the book of Proverbs, if you will.

00:37:18.419 --> 00:37:20.419
We're going to look at just a few verses.

00:37:20.419 --> 00:37:23.419
We had a bunch more written down, but we're running out of time this morning.

00:37:23.419 --> 00:37:25.419
I told you that two points didn't mean it'd be any faster.

00:37:25.419 --> 00:37:27.419
Proverbs 24 and verse 23.

00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:32.419
Notice what the Bible says in Proverbs 24 and verse number 23.

00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:34.419
These things also belong to the wise.

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:40.419
It is not good to have respective persons in judgment.

00:37:40.419 --> 00:37:44.419
It is not good to have respective persons in judgment.

00:37:44.419 --> 00:37:46.419
Proverbs 28 and verse number 21.

00:37:46.419 --> 00:37:49.419
We find again this truth restated.

00:37:49.419 --> 00:37:54.419
It says to have respective persons is not good.

00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:58.419
For a piece of bread that man will transgress.

00:37:58.419 --> 00:38:00.419
We're to be no respecter of persons.

00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:02.419
The book of James deals with it this way.

00:38:02.419 --> 00:38:05.419
Turn to James chapter 2, if you will.

00:38:05.419 --> 00:38:07.419
In the New Testament, the book of James.

00:38:07.419 --> 00:38:10.419
And I want you to see in James chapter number 2.

00:38:10.419 --> 00:38:13.419
And we will not have time to read the entirety,

00:38:13.419 --> 00:38:16.419
the portion of Scripture, really verses 1 through 9.

00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:19.419
I'll just read a few of these verses.

00:38:19.419 --> 00:38:22.419
This idea of rejecting partiality.

00:38:22.419 --> 00:38:25.419
The Bible says in James chapter 2 and verse number 1.

00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:32.419
By the way, can I say this?

00:38:32.419 --> 00:38:34.419
Jesus was counter-cultural.

00:38:34.419 --> 00:38:36.419
What do I mean by that?

00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:40.419
Do you know that the Jewish people hated the Samaritans?

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:42.419
They hated them.

00:38:43.419 --> 00:38:44.419
They would not go.

00:38:44.419 --> 00:38:46.419
They would not interact with.

00:38:46.419 --> 00:38:48.419
They would not have conversation with.

00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:50.419
They hated the Samaritans.

00:38:50.419 --> 00:38:54.419
But Jesus in John chapter number 4 says,

00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.419
I must needs go through Samaria.

00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:00.419
He didn't go around Samaria

00:39:00.419 --> 00:39:04.419
as was the standard behavior of the day.

00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:06.419
He went through Samaria.

00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:07.419
Why?

00:39:07.419 --> 00:39:09.419
Well, there's a widow that he needed to meet.

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:11.419
The widow at the well.

00:39:11.419 --> 00:39:13.419
By the way, it wasn't just the widow

00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:14.419
because she went back

00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:17.419
and she told all those people about Jesus.

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:20.419
And there was a great host of people that got saved

00:39:20.419 --> 00:39:24.419
because Jesus went to Samaria.

00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:27.419
And by the way, when he gave the Great Commission,

00:39:27.419 --> 00:39:29.419
he said in the book of Acts,

00:39:29.419 --> 00:39:31.419
and you shall be witnesses unto me,

00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:33.419
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

00:39:33.419 --> 00:39:36.419
you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea,

00:39:36.419 --> 00:39:37.419
and where?

00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:38.419
Samaria.

00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:40.419
And under the uttermost part of the earth.

00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:42.419
He was counter-cultural.

00:39:42.419 --> 00:39:44.419
He loved all people.

00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:46.419
Because they're all made in the image of God.

00:39:46.419 --> 00:39:48.419
In James chapter 2 and verse number 1,

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.419
the Bible says this in verse 2,

00:39:50.419 --> 00:39:52.419
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring

00:39:52.419 --> 00:39:53.419
and goodly apparel,

00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:55.419
and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment,

00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:57.419
do you see the picture that's being painted?

00:39:57.419 --> 00:40:00.419
You begin to see that one appears

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:04.739
to have some money and the other appears to be poor.

00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:07.179
And he says, and ye have respect to him

00:40:07.179 --> 00:40:08.419
that weareth the gay clothing.

00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:11.759
Now understand that's the old English word of gay, okay?

00:40:11.759 --> 00:40:13.299
It's not talking about the new way

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:15.739
that people are using that word, so just understand that.

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:18.259
And saying to him, sit thou here in a good place

00:40:18.259 --> 00:40:20.619
and say to the poor, stand thou there

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:22.579
or sit here under my footstool.

00:40:22.579 --> 00:40:25.539
Are ye not then partial in yourselves

00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:29.139
and are become judges of evil thoughts?

00:40:30.099 --> 00:40:32.179
Verse nine, he says this,

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:35.419
but if you have respect to persons, ye commit what?

00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:37.279
Sin, that's pretty plain, isn't it?

00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:40.019
I think it's not difficult to understand

00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:41.299
that verse of scripture.

00:40:41.299 --> 00:40:44.219
If ye have respect to persons, you commit sin

00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:47.579
and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:49.819
You know that back in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter one

00:40:49.819 --> 00:40:51.059
and again in chapter number 16,

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:53.599
it talks about not having respect of persons.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:56.179
This is a Bible truth from the beginning to the end.

00:40:56.179 --> 00:40:57.979
Our God has no respect of persons.

00:40:57.979 --> 00:41:00.299
By the way, I'm thankful for that.

00:41:00.299 --> 00:41:03.139
I'm thankful that our God has no respect of persons.

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:05.659
And we understand that the conduct of an elder

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:07.299
should be to pursue purity.

00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:09.759
It should be to reject partiality.

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:12.659
Turn back to 1 Timothy chapter number five, if you will,

00:41:12.659 --> 00:41:16.299
and we'll finish here with the matter of wine.

00:41:16.299 --> 00:41:18.859
What an exciting subject, hallelujah.

00:41:20.859 --> 00:41:22.099
1 Timothy chapter five,

00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:25.099
notice what the Bible says in verse number 23.

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:26.819
It's dealing with the conduct of an elder.

00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:28.979
In verse 23, I was gonna preach a whole message on this,

00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:31.619
but we gotta get going through the whole of this book

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:32.739
and also the next.

00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:36.179
But he says, drink no longer water,

00:41:36.179 --> 00:41:39.499
but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake

00:41:39.499 --> 00:41:41.939
and thine often infirmities.

00:41:41.939 --> 00:41:44.099
Now, I wanna understand something this morning

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:45.239
as I begin to deal with this,

00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:47.499
the conduct of an elder and addressing specifically

00:41:47.499 --> 00:41:50.139
the matter of wine in this text of scripture.

00:41:50.139 --> 00:41:53.639
There are two texts of scripture that often people will come

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:55.239
and they will present to someone

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:58.359
when they're trying to justify the use of alcohol.

00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:00.359
One of them is this one.

00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:02.719
The other is in John chapter two.

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:03.919
And here's what they say.

00:42:03.919 --> 00:42:06.179
Well, Jesus turned water into wine.

00:42:07.239 --> 00:42:10.239
And Paul told Timothy to drink a little wine.

00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:11.719
And they'll use those two texts of scriptures

00:42:11.719 --> 00:42:15.559
to justify their idea of drinking alcohol.

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:16.679
They forget that the Bible says

00:42:16.679 --> 00:42:18.919
that we're to not look at the wine

00:42:18.919 --> 00:42:20.839
when it moveth itself awry.

00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:22.239
They forget to understand the truth

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.959
that wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.

00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:26.959
Whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:28.839
And so there's a whole host of scriptures

00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:32.159
that people ignore when they try to justify something.

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:33.559
Here's what I've said for years.

00:42:33.559 --> 00:42:35.079
If you wanna justify something,

00:42:35.079 --> 00:42:36.879
you're gonna figure out a way to do it.

00:42:36.879 --> 00:42:38.299
If you wanna do something bad enough,

00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:40.639
you're gonna figure out a way to justify it and to do it.

00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:43.679
That's just the reality of human nature.

00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:45.239
But as I look at this passage of scripture,

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:46.879
there are, or this verse of scripture

00:42:46.879 --> 00:42:48.879
with regard to the use a little wine,

00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:51.999
there are two key things that must be acknowledged.

00:42:51.999 --> 00:42:53.719
Number one, do you notice where he says,

00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:56.399
drink no longer water?

00:42:56.399 --> 00:42:57.739
Do you see it in your Bible?

00:42:57.739 --> 00:42:59.999
He says, drink no longer water.

00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:03.519
Now, why would it be that Paul is instructing Timothy

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:04.859
to drink no longer water?

00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:06.239
Have you ever traveled somewhere

00:43:06.239 --> 00:43:07.799
where the water is not sanitary,

00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:10.319
the water is not safe to drink?

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:13.099
So there are, when I went to Mexico,

00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:14.679
they said, listen, whatever you do,

00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.239
do not drink the water.

00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:19.039
They said, don't use the water to brush your teeth.

00:43:19.039 --> 00:43:20.719
Don't use the water, use a,

00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:23.439
we had to use water bottles to brush our teeth

00:43:23.439 --> 00:43:24.959
and clean off our toothbrush.

00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:27.599
They said, listen, it'll make you sick.

00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:29.279
It's not good.

00:43:29.279 --> 00:43:30.599
Don't drink it.

00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:32.599
So I was really careful.

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:34.479
And we're, it was like the last day we were there.

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:36.179
We're in this big room

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:38.839
and there's different shower units in this room.

00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:41.799
And the one pastor that's there, all of a sudden,

00:43:41.799 --> 00:43:44.239
we're all in there and he says, oh no.

00:43:44.239 --> 00:43:45.639
And he kind of hollers out like that.

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:46.519
We're like, what in the world happened?

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:48.079
We thought there's a snake in there or something,

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.839
you know, I have no idea what happened.

00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:52.559
And he said, I just used the water to swish out my mouth.

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:54.279
I'm gonna be so sick.

00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:55.759
And he was like paranoid, right?

00:43:55.759 --> 00:43:58.519
Right away, I'm gonna be so sick.

00:43:58.519 --> 00:44:00.439
And the reality is that there are places

00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:02.799
you can still travel today

00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:04.639
where the water's not safe to drink.

00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:07.199
How much more back then?

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:13.419
Timothy is given this instruction, drink no longer water.

00:44:13.419 --> 00:44:14.759
But then I want you to notice another key

00:44:14.759 --> 00:44:15.879
in the verse of scripture.

00:44:15.879 --> 00:44:20.519
He says, for thy stomach's sake

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:24.599
and thine often infirmities.

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:26.479
So there are two keys that are given to us here.

00:44:26.479 --> 00:44:28.159
Number one, drink no longer water.

00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.279
The water was not safe.

00:44:29.279 --> 00:44:31.279
The water was causing some difficulties.

00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:34.119
By the way, if you drink water that's not sanitary,

00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:35.319
if you're traveling abroad

00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:37.279
and you partake of water that's not sanitary,

00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:38.119
you know what it does?

00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:40.759
It adversely affects your digestion.

00:44:40.759 --> 00:44:42.879
It makes you sick, all right?

00:44:42.879 --> 00:44:45.279
So he says, not only drink no longer water,

00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:49.879
but he says in verse 23, for thy stomach's sake

00:44:49.879 --> 00:44:53.479
and thine often infirmities.

00:44:53.479 --> 00:44:57.839
Obviously, Timothy was dealing with an ongoing issue here.

00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:59.439
And with this ongoing issue,

00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:02.599
there is a piece of instruction that is given.

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.079
What is that instruction?

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:08.079
But use a little wine, use a little wine.

00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:09.679
Now it's important for us to understand,

00:45:09.679 --> 00:45:11.679
and I'm gonna ask this question this morning.

00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:15.159
We believe that God is the creator God.

00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:16.839
Do you believe that this morning?

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:17.679
You believe that God is the creator?

00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:19.719
Do you believe that God is omniscient,

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.199
that he knows all things?

00:45:21.199 --> 00:45:22.559
I believe that this morning.

00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:25.719
Do you believe that God is the author of the Bible?

00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:28.839
He says all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:30.199
and is profitable, right?

00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:32.479
All scripture, not most of it, not some of it,

00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:33.919
but all of it.

00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:35.679
Do you believe this morning

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:38.679
that God is smarter than Google?

00:45:40.979 --> 00:45:42.639
You laugh.

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:43.859
You laugh, why?

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:46.419
You know how many people say, look at Google,

00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:47.899
or they'll bring you some kind of thing and they'll say,

00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:50.259
well, Google said, right?

00:45:50.259 --> 00:45:52.859
Google is the, come on,

00:45:52.859 --> 00:45:54.899
they run algorithms for all that stuff.

00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:56.979
I'm not smart enough to understand how it all works,

00:45:56.979 --> 00:45:58.339
but I am smart enough to know this,

00:45:58.339 --> 00:45:59.779
God is smarter than Google.

00:46:00.859 --> 00:46:02.179
Amen.

00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:02.999
Amen.

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:04.819
Come on, you know it this morning.

00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:06.759
He is the creator God.

00:46:06.759 --> 00:46:09.019
Can I tell you what Google will tell you if you look up,

00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:11.459
should I drink wine for my stomach?

00:46:11.459 --> 00:46:12.679
Absolutely not.

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:15.519
It is the absolute worst thing you could do

00:46:15.519 --> 00:46:19.519
if you have stomach issues is to drink alcohol.

00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:21.919
It is the absolute, no doctor in their right mind

00:46:21.919 --> 00:46:25.039
would ever tell you to drink alcohol

00:46:25.039 --> 00:46:27.279
if you have stomach issues.

00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:28.319
All right, Google knows that.

00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:29.159
You go look it up.

00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:32.739
I got screenshots of it on my iPad, all right?

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:34.399
So if your Google says something different,

00:46:34.399 --> 00:46:36.119
I got screenshots, amen?

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:37.799
But I under, listen, I've studied this out.

00:46:37.799 --> 00:46:39.059
I've studied this out for years.

00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:40.799
I preached a message years ago

00:46:40.799 --> 00:46:42.479
called the deceitfulness of alcohol.

00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:44.059
It's still on our website.

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:44.899
You can go listen to it.

00:46:44.899 --> 00:46:45.799
It's a whole message on it.

00:46:45.799 --> 00:46:48.959
But the reality is that no doctor

00:46:48.959 --> 00:46:53.639
is ever going to prescribe to an individual

00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:57.199
that has stomach issues to drink alcohol.

00:46:57.199 --> 00:46:59.039
Furthermore, there's a study.

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:01.239
It came out just a couple of years ago.

00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:02.079
I didn't bring it with me.

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:02.919
It's on my desk.

00:47:02.919 --> 00:47:04.199
But there's a study that came out.

00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:07.599
I saw it on Fox News a couple of years ago,

00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:09.039
and I said, man, this is wonderful.

00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:10.799
And I printed that thing out, saved it,

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:11.919
and it said this.

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:16.199
It said no person under 40 years old

00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:19.039
should ever drink alcohol.

00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:21.239
There are zero health benefits.

00:47:21.239 --> 00:47:24.079
You should be a total abstainer.

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:25.319
Now, can I tell you this morning,

00:47:25.319 --> 00:47:28.239
that's not popular with all the beer manufacturers

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:29.599
and all the alcohol, why?

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.319
There's a huge industry.

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:34.319
Those people make lots of money, okay?

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:36.599
So those studies are not popular,

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:38.719
but they came out with it,

00:47:38.719 --> 00:47:40.519
and I have the article printed,

00:47:40.519 --> 00:47:43.439
and it says there is zero, not there's some,

00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:47.159
there are zero health benefits to alcohol.

00:47:47.159 --> 00:47:50.039
Now, if scientists and if medicine

00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:53.919
and if Google can figure all that stuff out in 2024,

00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:57.079
I submit to you this morning that the creator God,

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:00.359
who is the omniscient God, knows all things,

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:04.679
and he never in his word would have told Paul

00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:09.119
to give Timothy alcoholic beverage for his stomach's sake.

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.559
Not a chance.

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:12.039
So if you wanna find a verse

00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:14.079
that's going to justify your behavior,

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:17.959
you can't use 1 Timothy 5 anymore, amen, honestly.

00:48:17.959 --> 00:48:22.959
It's just not a valid interpretation of scripture.

00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:26.679
I have found, however, and you cannot find this online

00:48:26.679 --> 00:48:30.459
where it has been something that has been verified,

00:48:30.459 --> 00:48:33.239
but I did some research years ago,

00:48:33.239 --> 00:48:34.599
and I found this to be the case.

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:35.880
I read it in a couple of studies.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.239
There are others that have come out and said,

00:48:37.239 --> 00:48:38.399
no, it's not true,

00:48:38.399 --> 00:48:41.760
but I can tell you that we've practiced it personally,

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.679
and that is this, that pure grape juice

00:48:44.679 --> 00:48:49.679
is actually a huge benefit if you have stomach issues.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.119
In fact, there are some studies that have suggested,

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:55.880
and again, they say that they're not verifiable.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.479
They have suggested that if you are exposed

00:48:58.479 --> 00:48:59.559
to a stomach virus,

00:48:59.559 --> 00:49:02.119
now, how many of you like stomach viruses?

00:49:02.119 --> 00:49:02.959
Amen.

00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:04.239
During that whole COVID thing,

00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:05.440
everyone wanted to ask you about,

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.880
do you have this symptom, this symptom,

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.919
this symptom, this symptom,

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.079
and I was so like just wanting to mess with people

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:12.479
and say, man, I don't have any of that,

00:49:12.479 --> 00:49:15.000
but I've been throwing up like crazy,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.399
and I just got this,

00:49:16.399 --> 00:49:17.679
because they didn't seem to care about

00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:19.039
any of that sort of thing,

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:21.039
but I do not, Pierre, you know,

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:23.719
I hate the idea of a stomach bug.

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:28.659
It absolutely is the last thing I ever wanna have.

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:30.839
So as I was doing some study,

00:49:30.839 --> 00:49:33.000
it said that pure grape juice can help,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.239
and it can prevent, it can do all kinds of benefits

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:36.279
if you have gut things,

00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:39.320
if you're exposed to some type of a stomach virus,

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.399
and so now in the man household,

00:49:41.399 --> 00:49:43.279
anytime there's a stomach bug that goes around,

00:49:43.279 --> 00:49:46.039
the first thing we do, get the grape juice.

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:47.559
I mean, the pure stuff, man,

00:49:47.559 --> 00:49:50.559
and can I tell you, we have seen the benefit of it,

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:51.599
personally.

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:53.000
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.320
I'm just an individual that did some study

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.239
and found out some things,

00:49:57.239 --> 00:49:59.320
and I've suggested to other people.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.279
My brother,

00:50:00.279 --> 00:50:02.159
He said, man, the kid's got a stomach bug.

00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:04.239
I said, you better go get some grape juice, man.

00:50:04.239 --> 00:50:05.159
Just go get that stuff.

00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:07.879
And it's helped us.

00:50:07.879 --> 00:50:09.799
As I look at this passage of Scripture

00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:12.999
and I find the conduct of an elder,

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:16.119
he says we're to pursue purity.

00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:18.799
He says that we're to reject partiality.

00:50:18.799 --> 00:50:20.719
And then he deals with the subject of wine

00:50:20.719 --> 00:50:21.999
that's mixed right in the midst

00:50:21.999 --> 00:50:23.759
of this whole text of Scripture.

00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:26.879
But in the midst of speaking about wine,

00:50:26.879 --> 00:50:29.599
we can assuredly say this morning

00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:32.079
that there's no way that God Almighty,

00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:34.799
the creator and the all wise God,

00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:39.799
would have Paul tell Timothy to drink alcoholic beverage

00:50:39.799 --> 00:50:41.239
for his stomach's sake.

00:50:41.239 --> 00:50:44.519
No, the water was going to contribute further

00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:47.839
to his stomach issues, his often infirmities,

00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:52.839
and therefore drink no longer water.

00:50:52.999 --> 00:50:55.919
But use a little wine for thy stomach's sake

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.759
and thine often infirmities.

00:50:57.759 --> 00:50:59.839
I'm thankful that God has given us

00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:02.039
every word of Scripture.

00:51:02.039 --> 00:51:05.519
Listen, the Bible says that every word of God is pure.

00:51:05.519 --> 00:51:08.479
See, God put all of verse 23 in there

00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:11.239
so that we could interpret it properly

00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:13.599
that Paul didn't just say, hey, don't drink any water,

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:16.079
but drink wine, period.

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.399
That would be open to all kinds

00:51:17.399 --> 00:51:20.399
of different interpretations and understandings.

00:51:20.399 --> 00:51:24.319
But he says, don't do it for this reason.

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:26.599
And when we understand that reason,

00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:30.799
it helps us to come to a proper conclusion.

00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:33.399
This morning, we look at this passage of Scripture

00:51:33.399 --> 00:51:35.839
in 1 Timothy 5 and verse 17 through 25,

00:51:35.839 --> 00:51:37.919
and we see that in this passage

00:51:37.919 --> 00:51:40.759
it's dealing specifically with elders.

00:51:40.759 --> 00:51:42.759
But I said to you a few minutes ago,

00:51:42.759 --> 00:51:46.839
and I'll say it again, every child of God,

00:51:46.839 --> 00:51:50.119
their conduct should be honorable.

00:51:50.119 --> 00:51:52.439
It's not just honorable elders,

00:51:52.439 --> 00:51:55.039
it should be honorable Christians.

00:51:55.039 --> 00:51:57.959
That we live in such a way

00:51:57.959 --> 00:52:00.799
that we bring honor and glory to our God,

00:52:00.799 --> 00:52:05.039
that we are pursuing purity in our lives,

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.599
that we are rejecting partiality,

00:52:07.599 --> 00:52:11.199
that we are understanding that there are things,

00:52:11.199 --> 00:52:13.759
behaviors that are appropriate and pleasing,

00:52:13.759 --> 00:52:16.039
and there are behaviors that are not appropriate,

00:52:16.039 --> 00:52:18.299
they're inappropriate, they're displeasing.

00:52:19.199 --> 00:52:20.839
As I mentioned to you at that conference,

00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:24.759
they said, if you do any of these things, you're out.

00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:26.599
No refund.

00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:29.319
Can I tell you that the sponsors

00:52:29.319 --> 00:52:31.559
and organizers of that conference,

00:52:33.399 --> 00:52:35.619
they're not our audience.

00:52:36.679 --> 00:52:40.719
God Almighty, the thrice holy God,

00:52:40.719 --> 00:52:42.879
He is the one that we serve.

00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:47.319
And oh, how our behavior should align biblically,

00:52:47.319 --> 00:52:49.679
that we can thank God for the encouragement

00:52:49.679 --> 00:52:51.719
that He gives us, we can thank God

00:52:51.719 --> 00:52:53.599
for the warnings that He provides,

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:57.079
and we can thank God for the instruction that He gives.

00:52:57.079 --> 00:52:58.759
Can I tell you this morning?

00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:03.359
Instruction from God is only beneficial when it's applied.

00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:09.079
It's not enough to know it, to hear it.

00:53:09.079 --> 00:53:10.159
We must do it.

00:53:10.159 --> 00:53:13.299
We must pursue purity and reject partiality.

00:53:13.299 --> 00:53:14.139
Let's pray.

00:53:14.139 --> 00:53:15.079
Father, we love you.

00:53:15.079 --> 00:53:16.159
We thank you for loving us.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.559
We thank you for the opportunity to be gathered.

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:21.239
Thank you for your word, the clarity of it.

00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:23.679
And God, I pray that you would help us this morning

00:53:23.679 --> 00:53:26.119
to submit ourselves to your word.

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:27.839
We know that you're the all-wise God.

00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:31.559
We know, God, that you are holy and you're just,

00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:34.319
and we thank you for the instruction that you've provided.

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:39.079
Help us, Lord, to pursue purity, to reject partiality.

00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:41.599
Help us to live and walk in such a way

00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:43.559
that you would be honored and glorified.

00:53:43.559 --> 00:53:44.959
God, if there's one here this morning

00:53:44.959 --> 00:53:48.459
that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray this morning

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:49.899
they'd come to this old-fashioned altar,

00:53:49.899 --> 00:53:51.419
they'd allow us to take a Bible and show them

00:53:51.419 --> 00:53:53.859
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home,

00:53:53.859 --> 00:53:55.439
that they would not leave this place

00:53:55.439 --> 00:54:00.099
without having 100% assurance that heaven is their home.

00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:01.539
I pray, God, that you'd move and work,

00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:02.659
that you'd be honored and glorified

00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:04.659
through all that's said and done.

00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:06.419
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
