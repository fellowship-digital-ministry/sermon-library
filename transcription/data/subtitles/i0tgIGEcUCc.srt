1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,119
Acts 27, Acts chapter number 27, and as you're turning there, I'm going to read a verse from

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,119
the book of Deuteronomy.

3
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:12,520
We'll reference some other things in the Old Testament as we go through the message this

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:20,360
evening, but I'd like for you to be there in Acts chapter number 27, and I'm so thankful

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,600
for the Word of God and for the way in which it's changed my life, and I know that you

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,319
too could testify of the change that God has made in your life using His Word.

7
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:38,759
I want to read this verse as kind of a springboard into the message this evening from Acts 27.

8
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:45,040
The book of Deuteronomy is recording, rehearsing some of the history of the children of Israel,

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,319
and here's what is said in Deuteronomy 1 and verse number 32, yet in this thing ye did

10
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:57,240
not believe the Lord your God.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,680
Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,120
I hope that it would never be said of us, individually or corporately, that we did not

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,279
believe God.

14
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,279
Amen?

15
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:20,639
I wouldn't want it to be said of me personally.

16
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:24,279
I wouldn't want it to be said of our family.

17
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:30,160
I wouldn't want it to be said of our church that we did not believe God.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,440
Amen?

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:41,800
I'd much rather be known for believing God, trusting God, exercising faith in God.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,319
Hebrews 11 reminds us that without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for he that

21
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,480
cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,720
seek him.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,279
Faith is simply taking God at His Word, believing that God will do what God said He will do.

24
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:07,639
Throughout this week of Vacation Bible School, we had a great week and we're thankful for

25
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:12,479
how God answered prayer and the opportunities to minister to these people, these young people

26
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,160
and their families.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,039
I was especially pleased with the way in which the children were attentive to the lessons.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,119
Of course, I taught the teen class, but as we would ask questions of several of the others

29
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:29,720
within the classes, you could tell that there was a level of attentiveness amongst the young

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,800
people as they were being instructed with regard to the subject matter at hand.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,080
And as I mentioned to you last week, the theme of our Vacation Bible School was Mystery Island,

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,759
Discovering the One True God.

33
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,960
And as we would go through the lessons, and really the lessons were designed to discuss

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,080
various attributes of God, and we dealt with the fact that God is great, and He is.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,919
We dealt with the fact that God is Almighty, and that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

36
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,360
above all that we ask or think, that He is omnipotent, He's omniscient, and He's omnipresent.

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,860
As we begin to understand that He's great and He's Almighty, it would lead us to a place

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,580
of standing in awe of who God is.

39
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,259
We dealt with the fact that He's the ruler.

40
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:25,940
I told our teen class that it is a settled fact that the Lord is the ruler of the universe,

41
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,580
and He rules in the affairs of mankind, that He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,139
There are times in which we may think what is going on and chaos seems to be prevalent

43
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:42,100
and prevailing, but yet we know that our God is in control.

44
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
He is ruler.

45
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,699
And I told the young people that if He is all that we've said that He is, and if He

46
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,139
is all that He has revealed to us in His word to be, and He is the ruler of the universe,

47
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,820
then who better to rule your life than Him?

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,500
You'll fail at ruling your own life.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,899
Make a mess of it.

50
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:03,899
Amen?

51
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,820
All of us would.

52
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,740
We dealt with the fact that He is God with us, Emmanuel.

53
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,079
What a blessing to know that when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son.

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,339
We understand that He sent forth His Son to go to the cross of Calvary to pay for the

55
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,339
sin of mankind to redeem us.

56
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,380
What a blessing.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,579
We ended on Friday with this truth that God is trustworthy.

58
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,579
He is trustworthy.

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,299
You know, the reality is as I kind of meditated, I taught the lessons, and then as I ended

60
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:45,339
the week and kind of meditated upon all that I had taught and how I sought to influence

61
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:50,899
the young people that were in my class, the reality is that as you go step by step through

62
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:57,459
those days and you come to Friday and you come to that lesson that God is trustworthy,

63
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:01,859
that really that's the only conclusion that you reach after you understand all of who

64
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,660
He is.

65
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,660
When you understand that He is the Almighty God, that He is the Great I Am, when you understand

66
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,739
all that He's revealed to us in His Word regarding His person, it would lead you naturally

67
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:20,859
to a place of saying, He's trustworthy.

68
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,380
He's dependable.

69
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,940
Our God is faithful.

70
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,299
He always has been, by the way.

71
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:28,299
Amen?

72
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:31,820
He's never failed, and He's not getting ready to begin failing.

73
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,339
Amen?

74
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,380
No one's going to ever overrun Him, dethrone Him.

75
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,820
It's not going to happen.

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,459
And as we look at Acts 27, and I visited this passage of Scripture with the young people

77
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,899
on Friday, and I want to develop it maybe a little bit more for us this evening.

78
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,339
As we look at this particular passage, we find that it's in verse number 9.

79
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:00,459
The Bible says, now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because

80
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:07,359
the fast was now already passed, Paul admonished them.

81
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,220
Notice what he said to them in verse number 10.

82
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,820
He said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage,

83
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,540
not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.

84
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:31,179
Nevertheless, notice verse number 11, nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the

85
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:38,540
owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

86
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,660
Because the haven was not commodious to winter in, notice this, the more part advised to

87
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,220
depart thence also, if by any means they may attain to Phinehas, and there to winter, which

88
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,179
is in haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south, west, and northwest.

89
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,980
Would you have noticed that phrase in verse number 11 when the Bible says, nevertheless

90
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,619
the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, notice, more than those

91
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:09,339
things which were spoken by Paul.

92
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,339
The title as you see in the bulletin today, the title for the message this evening is

93
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,779
this, who do you believe?

94
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,420
Who do you believe?

95
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:23,579
The reality is that everyone believes someone.

96
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,420
This centurion, he was going to place his trust, his confidence, he was going to believe

97
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,880
someone.

98
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,140
The reality is that the information that this man, this centurion received, was conflicting

99
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,579
information.

100
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,339
He had Paul on one hand saying, it's not safe for us to depart, it's not safe for us to

101
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,459
sail, it's dangerous, it's going to be wrought with danger.

102
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:54,100
And not only of the lading of the ship, but also of our lives.

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,579
And on the other hand, you have the master and owner of the ship saying, let's go.

104
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,339
You have the more part, as it says in verse number 12, you know what that means when it

105
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,619
says the more part advised, it means the majority.

106
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,140
The majority.

107
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,980
They say, no, no, it's good, it's fine, we're going to be able to make it.

108
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:19,859
The Bible says that the centurion, he is given this conflicting information, but he's got

109
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:20,859
to believe someone.

110
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:23,940
And who does he believe?

111
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,820
He goes with the majority.

112
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,059
He goes with the more part.

113
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:34,380
He goes with the owner and master of the ship, and they set sail.

114
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,739
As we go through the passage of Scripture this evening, we'll find that it was actually

115
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:43,659
a very poor decision on the part of this centurion.

116
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,500
But I want you to notice this evening that everyone believes someone.

117
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,659
Including you.

118
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,059
Including me.

119
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,020
You know that God wants you to believe Him.

120
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,460
God wants us to believe Him.

121
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,299
Do you think, as I read that verse of Scripture in Deuteronomy 1 and verse number 32, when

122
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:06,580
it says that they did not believe God, do you think that's what God wanted?

123
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,140
Well, no.

124
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,960
They absolutely, God absolutely wanted those people to believe Him.

125
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,080
This is really what Deuteronomy 1 is speaking of when you think about the children of Israel

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,799
and you think about their journey and all that had taken place.

127
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,559
I'm mindful of what the Word of God says in Numbers 14.

128
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,039
In Numbers chapter number 13, the Bible gives us the record of the spies going to spy out

129
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,039
the land.

130
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,260
And we find that in chapter number 13, the spies are selected and they're given their

131
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,919
instruction as with regard to what their task is.

132
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,719
We find that they depart and they go into the land as they had been instructed to do

133
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:44,719
so.

134
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:50,440
And they come back and we, several times this week, we were singing the song, 12 men went

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
to spy on Canaan.

136
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,280
And we're familiar with the text of Scripture and we know that the Bible teaches us that

137
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,320
there were 10 that came back with an evil report.

138
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,960
They did not believe God.

139
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,840
They did not believe that they were able

140
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,440
to go in and possess the land.

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
There were two, however.

142
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,400
Joshua and Caleb.

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,640
Joshua and Caleb, they believed

144
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
that God was able.

145
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,860
They believed that God could

146
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,920
give them that which God had promised them.

147
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,120
By the way, God had proven

148
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,840
to this group of people

149
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
many, many times,

150
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,520
over and over and over.

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,400
He'd proven His power and His might

152
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,920
and His ability.

153
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,280
These people had experienced

154
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
not only the plagues in Egypt

155
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,840
and what a wonder those were

156
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
as you begin to read in the book of Exodus

157
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,720
and read about the plagues

158
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,080
and you see the power of God on display.

159
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
You find that after the death of the firstborn

160
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,400
that they leave and God leads them

161
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,000
and they come to the Red Sea

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,640
and God parts the Red Sea

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,520
and they cross over on dry ground.

164
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
Miraculous.

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
Can you imagine being there

166
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,920
and experiencing that?

167
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,320
It was so impactful that the Egyptians,

168
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,720
they said, well, let us go as well.

169
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,440
We're going to pursue them.

170
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
Bad decision.

171
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,520
God had instructed the children of Israel

172
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,720
and God provided a way for the children of Israel,

173
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,440
but it was in the midst of the Red Sea

174
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
in which God destroyed the Egyptians

175
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,360
that sought to pursue after.

176
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
I mentioned this morning

177
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
that God knows what we need

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
and I mentioned about God

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,800
knowing that the children of Israel

180
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,560
needed water and they needed food

181
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,600
and we find that just after they crossed over the Red Sea

182
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,000
that as they're being led by God

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
that they come to a place

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,400
where there's bitter water.

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,840
Did God know that they needed water?

186
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,880
Sure He did.

187
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
Could God have led them to a different place?

188
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
Sure He could.

189
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,880
But He led them there.

190
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,280
It wasn't Moses that led the children of Israel

191
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,120
to that place.

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,080
It was God that led them to that place.

193
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,440
And God led them to a place

194
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
where there was bitter water.

195
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
They begin to murmur and complain

196
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
and Moses prays and God says there's a tree

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,920
and go put that tree in the water

198
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,360
and the waters were healed

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,760
and now they could drink the waters.

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,880
What a blessing to see how God blessed

201
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,680
and worked and provided.

202
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
And then in just a little while

203
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,920
God leads them again

204
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,000
and now they come to a place

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,400
where there's no water.

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,120
You say God don't you know that we need water?

207
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah He knows.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,760
He's aware.

209
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,680
I think it's interesting

210
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
I actually said this to the young people.

211
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,440
God could have led them again

212
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,000
to a place that had bitter water.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
What would you have done?

214
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,640
What do you think they would have done

215
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,160
if God took them to a place again

216
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,640
that had bitter water?

217
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,560
I think they would have looked for a tree.

218
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,880
They would have looked for a tree

219
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
that resembled the tree

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,160
that they put in the previous waters.

221
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,680
Why? Because that's human nature.

222
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
We just like to depend upon ourselves.

223
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,840
Right?

224
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,680
So what does God do?

225
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,280
He takes them to a place

226
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,160
where there's no water.

227
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,000
And then He supplies water from a rock.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
These people had experienced

229
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
the power of God displayed

230
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,640
over and over and over.

231
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,600
And in Numbers 13,

232
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
they bring up this evil report.

233
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
In Numbers 14,

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
there's this great discourse that takes place.

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,400
And of course, Joshua and Caleb

236
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,440
are trying to steal the people

237
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,920
and get them to believe God

238
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,400
and to enter into.

239
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
And Caleb says this.

240
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
And in verse 7 it says,

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,960
and they spake in Numbers 14,

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,400
and they spake unto all the company

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
of the children of Israel,

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
saying, the land which we pass through

245
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,280
to search it is an exceeding good land.

246
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,600
If the Lord delight in us,

247
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,240
then He will bring us into this land

248
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
and give it us a land

249
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,440
which floweth with milk and honey.

250
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,600
Only rebel not ye against the Lord.

251
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,880
Neither fear ye the people of the land,

252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
for they are bred for us.

253
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,320
Their defenses departed from them.

254
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,280
And the Lord is with us.

255
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,440
Fear them not.

256
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Verse 10 is a sad verse of Scripture.

257
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
It says, but all the congregation

258
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,240
bade stone them with stones.

259
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
They're ready to stone them.

260
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Simply because they say

261
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,680
we need to believe God.

262
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
In verse 11, God speaks to Moses.

263
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
And notice what the Bible says.

264
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,480
The Lord said unto Moses,

265
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,600
How long will this people provoke me?

266
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,800
And how long will it be

267
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,320
ere they believe me?

268
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,400
For all the signs which I have showed

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,080
among them.

270
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,320
You know, God wants His people to believe Him.

271
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,160
He wants you and He wants me to believe Him.

272
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,000
He wants us to trust Him.

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
He wants us to place our confidence,

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
our faith, our faith in Him.

275
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,320
It's interesting to me that we understand

276
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,760
and readily acknowledge the fact

277
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,080
that we cannot save ourselves.

278
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Amen?

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And so therefore, very few of us

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,640
have any trouble with fully trusting God

281
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,880
for our eternity.

282
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,600
Right?

283
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
Because we know there's nothing we can do about it.

284
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,120
But it seems like the God that we trust for eternity,

285
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,480
sometimes we have trouble trusting Him for today.

286
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,720
You ever notice that in our lives?

287
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
That we're trusting Him for eternity,

288
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,520
but we can struggle with trusting Him for today.

289
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,240
I believe that as we would look back to Acts chapter 27,

290
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,160
and if you are taking notes and consider the counsel

291
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
that the centurion received,

292
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
we already kind of dealt with it,

293
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
but you consider the counsel,

294
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,440
and we find that as these folks were getting ready to depart,

295
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,280
we understand there are 276 of them.

296
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,080
If you look at verse number 37,

297
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,040
you'll find the number, the head count if you will,

298
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,200
of those that are going to sail.

299
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
And these 276, they're there and they're waiting.

300
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
Are we gonna leave?

301
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,880
Are we not gonna leave?

302
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,720
What are we doing?

303
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
And the time to sail according to what Paul says

304
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,800
or what is given to us as kind of a backdrop,

305
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
that was now dangerous,

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,320
and we find that the counsel that was received

307
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,560
from the centurion,

308
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,280
there was a conflict within the counsel.

309
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,080
The reality is that this man was given counsel from Paul

310
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,240
that differed from what the owner and master of the ship said

311
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,440
that differed from what the majority, the more part said.

312
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,720
You know, today, we still get conflicting information.

313
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,080
We still get conflicting counsel.

314
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,320
That's why it's important that we have the right counselors.

315
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,720
The Bible says that there's safety

316
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
in the multitude of counselors,

317
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,600
but you better make sure they're the right counselors.

318
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Amen?

319
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,360
Because the reality is that you can get

320
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,080
some wrong counselors and they can give you some bad counsel

321
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,200
and you can say, well, I counseled.

322
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,000
You understand that counsel is not just getting someone

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to tell you what you wanna hear.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,120
That's not counsel.

325
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,880
Dean has a little cartoon in the office,

326
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
in the finance office.

327
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,600
I don't know exactly how it says,

328
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
but basically people don't want your opinion.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,280
They want their opinion coming out of your mouth.

330
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,600
And it's a cute little cartoon

331
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,160
and I've seen it several times over the years.

332
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
He's got another one that doesn't make any sense to me

333
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,680
because it says bacon doesn't make everything better,

334
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,400
but bacon normally makes things pretty good, you know?

335
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,400
But anyhow, the reality is that today,

336
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,400
today, you can find so much contradiction

337
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,680
in so many different voices that are trying to get you

338
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,360
to go in a particular direction.

339
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
And we find that in particular,

340
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,920
my thoughts as we look here at verse number 12,

341
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
it's interesting when it says,

342
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,000
the more part advised to depart.

343
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,000
You know, one of the dangers in our society today

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,720
is this idea of, well, the majority say.

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Just because the majority says

346
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,080
doesn't mean the majority's right.

347
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
Have we not taught our children that, right?

348
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
We understand that, listen,

349
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
just because it's the number one result

350
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,400
on the Google search doesn't mean it's right.

351
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,840
In fact, if you're looking for some good truth,

352
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,480
you might not wanna look at the number one search

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,040
that's returned on the Google search

354
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,559
because they use all sorts of various metrics

355
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,559
and what have you to get that stuff to come up.

356
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,200
And you find that, listen,

357
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,520
the reality is there's so many voices

358
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,840
and it can be confusing.

359
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
Can you imagine being in the shoes of the centurion

360
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,320
in this particular passage of Scripture?

361
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,960
Can you imagine the pressure

362
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,040
and the responsibility of having to make the decision,

363
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,240
do we sail or do we not?

364
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,320
That's a big decision.

365
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,000
It's a lot of pressure.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,720
It's one thing if it's just you taking a voyage

367
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,840
and you're by yourself

368
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,559
and maybe just a couple of folks with you,

369
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,600
but when there's 276 people

370
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,920
that are going to be sailing with you,

371
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,080
that is a big responsibility.

372
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
I understand that Paul is not God.

373
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I understand that.

374
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,440
But Paul gives him counsel.

375
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,100
And he says, I'm going to believe these guys

376
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,740
instead of believing him.

377
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,860
We find that as we think about

378
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,520
the counsel that was received,

379
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,640
we think about the way in which he responded.

380
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,480
And as we notice that he responds

381
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,820
by believing and setting sail,

382
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,000
believing the most part, the more part,

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,760
the majority, believing the owner

384
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
and master of the ship.

385
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
The Bible says in v. 13,

386
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,320
and when the south wind blew softly,

387
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,480
supposing that they had obtained their purpose,

388
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,720
loosing fence, they sailed close by Crete.

389
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,160
Notice these next four words,

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,880
but not long after.

391
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
Not long after,

392
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,360
there arose against it a tempestuous wind

393
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,080
called Uroclidan.

394
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,840
The Bible says that the ship was caught

395
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
and could not bear up into the wind.

396
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,280
We let her drive,

397
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,640
standing under a certain island

398
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,080
which is called Clauda.

399
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,480
We had much work to come by the boat.

400
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
Which when they had taken up,

401
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
they used helps undergirding the ship

402
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,240
and fearing lest they should fall

403
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,360
into the quicksands.

404
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,040
Straight sail, and so were driven.

405
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,000
And we, being exceedingly tossed

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,320
with a tempest,

407
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
the next day lightened the ship.

408
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,600
They were tossing goods overboard.

409
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,720
It says the third day,

410
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,280
we cast out with our own hands

411
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
the tackling of the ship.

412
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,040
I wouldn't want to be in there for three hours.

413
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,480
Amen?

414
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
The third day.

415
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Notice verse 20.

416
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,760
And when neither sun nor stars

417
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,000
in many days appeared,

418
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,880
and no small tempest lay on us,

419
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,000
notice this phrase,

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,040
all hope that we should be saved

421
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,800
was then taken away.

422
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,880
They're in a place where we could

423
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,680
literally say they were hopeless.

424
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Hopeless.

425
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
I've never been in a storm like this

426
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,760
on the seas.

427
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
I just never have.

428
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,520
In fact, I never would like to be

429
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
on a ship in a storm like this.

430
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,400
Not really my desire.

431
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm not interested in being

432
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,440
in the middle of the water

433
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,480
and not being able to see the sun

434
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,280
or the stars for days.

435
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Not signing up for that.

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
But that's where they are.

437
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
Do you think for a moment

438
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
that this centurion wished

439
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,080
that he could have changed his decision?

440
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Yeah.

441
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,160
Have you ever been in a place

442
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,760
where you say,

443
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,560
man, I wish I could change my decision.

444
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,800
I mean, can I go back?

445
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,960
Can I change that choice?

446
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,960
It was a bad decision.

447
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
But they're in the middle of the Mediterranean.

448
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,600
I mean, they're in the middle of a storm.

449
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,160
There's nothing you can do at this point

450
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,560
to change your decision.

451
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
It doesn't matter how much regret you have.

452
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,400
It doesn't matter how much you can say,

453
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
I wish I would have believed.

454
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
They could come to Paul and say,

455
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Paul, you were so right.

456
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,840
I should have believed you, Paul.

457
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,600
Doesn't change the circumstances.

458
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Doesn't change.

459
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,680
We find that they're hopeless.

460
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,480
And as we find them in that hopeless situation,

461
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,080
and we've considered the counsel

462
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
that was received,

463
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,680
and we consider how it is

464
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,720
that he responded to Centurion,

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
I want you to understand

466
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,400
that God is going to give us

467
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
a few verses of Scripture here

468
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,240
to help us be reminded

469
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,040
that believers,

470
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,720
followers of the Lord Jesus Christ,

471
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
that we are to believe God.

472
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,120
We're to believe the Lord.

473
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,240
There are times in which

474
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
the circumstances that we face

475
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,800
may seem to be beyond our comprehension

476
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,080
that we can't figure it out.

477
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,240
If you're analytical,

478
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,280
if you're of that kind of a mindset,

479
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,960
you like to be able to figure things out

480
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,280
and kind of see where things are going,

481
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,600
sometimes, it'll just drive you crazy.

482
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,720
Because we don't always see

483
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,200
how God is working.

484
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,000
Was God in control

485
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
when they arrested the Lord Jesus Christ

486
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,720
and took Him to the cross of Calvary?

487
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,200
Do the disciples think so?

488
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,080
They were confused.

489
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,160
In fact, Peter,

490
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,480
did he not try to stop

491
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,080
the Lord Jesus Christ from going?

492
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,760
Not so, Lord!

493
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,160
That's what Peter said.

494
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,480
He was as in much control at Calvary

495
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,160
as he was at creation.

496
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,960
As much control.

497
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,560
At creation in Genesis 1

498
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,320
when God said let there be light

499
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
and there was light.

500
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,160
And He had His power on display

501
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,480
and He was in full control.

502
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,320
He was as much in control at Calvary

503
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,400
as He was at creation.

504
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,560
Because God makes no mistakes.

505
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,880
And God knew what He was doing.

506
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
And the reality is that

507
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,320
the Lord Jesus Christ,

508
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,640
He had to go to that cross of Calvary

509
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,120
so that He could pay for your sin

510
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
and for my sin.

511
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,400
We understand that in the book of Luke

512
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,640
when God records for us

513
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
when those disciples are walking back

514
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
on the road of Emmaus

515
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
and they're downhearted.

516
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,760
I mean, they are struggling

517
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,120
and their countenance is sad

518
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
that Jesus comes along them

519
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
and is walking with them.

520
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
And He says,

521
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,520
why is it that your countenance is sad?

522
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
And they say,

523
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
are you just a stranger in Jerusalem?

524
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,600
You don't know what's happened?

525
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
They were going home

526
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
not because they thought

527
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,440
God was in control.

528
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,920
They were perplexed.

529
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,000
We thought it had been Him.

530
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,720
That's what they say.

531
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
What does Jesus do?

532
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,700
He begins to talk to them.

533
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,200
He starts with Moses and the prophets.

534
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
And He expounds unto them

535
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,240
all things in the Scriptures

536
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,400
pertaining to Himself.

537
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
And He's going to keep on going.

538
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,080
They get home.

539
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
And they say,

540
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
come on in.

541
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Have a meal with us.

542
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Stay with us.

543
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,560
And He broke bread.

544
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,880
Their eyes were opened.

545
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,240
And He vanished.

546
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,680
And they said,

547
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,040
did not our heart burn within us

548
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,440
when He spoke along the way?

549
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,680
And what did they do?

550
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,660
They got back to Jerusalem in a hurry.

551
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,280
They just walked over seven miles.

552
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,360
And now they're, I think,

553
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,520
running back seven miles

554
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,400
with a level of excitement.

555
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
He is risen indeed!

556
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
I mean, this is an exciting story!

557
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
It's not just a story.

558
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
It's truth.

559
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
It's history.

560
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,560
And listen, Jesus,

561
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
He went to that cross

562
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
we sang tonight.

563
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,080
He did it for us.

564
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,220
And He was in absolute control.

565
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
What did Pilate say

566
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,420
during the interrogation?

567
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,940
I know I'm backing up a few days

568
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,620
in the history of which I'm dealing with,

569
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
but when you back up

570
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,940
and you look at the interrogation,

571
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Pilate says to Jesus,

572
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,980
don't you know that I have power?

573
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,380
Is that not what he says?

574
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,380
What does Jesus say?

575
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Ha!

576
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
You only have the kind of power

577
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
I give you.

578
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Right?

579
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,900
What did Jesus say?

580
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,100
John 10 we referenced this morning

581
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,380
about the Good Shepherd.

582
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
He says,

583
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,100
I lay down my life for the sheep.

584
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,380
No man taketh it from me.

585
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,140
He lays it down.

586
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,940
Listen, God is always in control.

587
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,780
In 2021,

588
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,060
in the midst of whatever chaos and confusion

589
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,180
you think we're living in,

590
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,100
God is in control.

591
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,860
And we as the people of God

592
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,740
must believe Him.

593
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,540
And we must trust Him.

594
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,140
Listen, God's Word still works.

595
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
You know that,

596
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,740
I said this to Holly this morning,

597
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
I said,

598
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,020
broadly speaking,

599
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,140
Christendom is in a mess right now.

600
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,700
The churches across the land,

601
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,340
things are going just crazy

602
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,220
what's going on.

603
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
In far too many,

604
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
not all,

605
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
listen, don't misunderstand

606
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
what I'm saying.

607
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
I'm not saying that

608
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,340
there's no good churches out there.

609
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,220
There are plenty of good solid churches

610
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,300
that are still standing for truth.

611
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
But you know that a lot of them

612
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,220
have forsaken this book.

613
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,260
And they've caved into the pressures of society.

614
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,700
And they begin to try to massage the Scriptures

615
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,420
to say something that they don't say.

616
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,980
And really, all they're doing

617
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,220
is 2 Timothy 4.

618
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,580
They're just itching, tickling people's ears.

619
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,300
And it's not going to change anybody.

620
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,100
It's not going to change anything.

621
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,340
Because God changes people.

622
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,940
We're not going to water down our message

623
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,540
and it be effective.

624
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,780
We're not going to employ our own

625
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,900
types of strategies and approaches

626
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,580
and our own methodology.

627
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,740
No, we need to follow God's methods.

628
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,500
And we do God's work God's way,

629
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,820
then we see what God is able to do.

630
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,340
It's far better to see what God can do

631
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,420
than to see what you can do

632
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,300
or what I can do.

633
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,580
Back in Acts 27,

634
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,460
Paul, the Bible says in verse 21,

635
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,220
but after long abstinence,

636
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,940
Paul stood forth in the midst of them

637
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,540
and said,

638
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,380
Sirs, you should have hearkened unto me

639
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,140
and not have loosed from Crete,

640
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,620
and to have gained this harm and loss.

641
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,740
But they couldn't change that, right?

642
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:01,300
change it. Notice verse 22, and now I exhort you to be of good cheer. I know

643
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,540
the verse doesn't end there, but can you imagine these guys listening to Paul? Be

644
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,260
of good cheer? We just got rid of all of our stuff, right? We haven't seen the Sun,

645
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,780
we haven't seen the stars for days. All hope that we should be saved is gone, and

646
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:24,540
you're telling us to be of good cheer? But that's what Paul says. But there's a

647
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:31,140
reason that Paul says it. Paul says this, be of good cheer, for there shall be no

648
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:41,580
loss of any man's life among you but of the ship. That's pretty encouraging. But

649
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,580
this isn't just Paul thinking this up on his own. This isn't some feel-good

650
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,340
preacher that just wants to put his arm around somebody and say everything's

651
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:59,900
going to be okay. Paul got a word from God. And the Bible tells us in verse

652
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:07,100
number 23 that Paul is going to rehearse this to these sirs that he references in

653
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,860
verse 21. For there stood by me this night the angel of God. Notice the way in

654
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:19,500
which he identifies whose I am and whom I serve. We talked this morning about

655
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,220
being mindful of our position. Aren't you thankful you belong to God? Now I belong

656
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:32,660
to Jesus. Jesus belongs to me. I am so thankful that I belong to Him. And Paul

657
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,420
says not only do I belong to Him but I serve Him. And here's what the angel of

658
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:44,700
God told me. He said this in verse 24, fear not Paul, thou must be brought

659
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:54,780
before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. These folks

660
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,260
were blessed because of Paul's presence being there. Because God says Paul you

661
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,500
need to appear before Caesar. And so I'm going to give all these other people

662
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,460
their lives too. You know God blessed Potiphar's house because of Joseph. Laban

663
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,180
understood that he was blessed because of Jacob. Right? These people are blessed

664
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,180
because Paul's there. By the way they ought to be happy that Paul got on the

665
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:30,300
boat. It says this, I love verse 25 of Acts 27. Wherefore sirs be of good cheer.

666
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:39,860
I have it circled in my Bible for I believe God. Now think about this. In the

667
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,340
midst, I mean it wasn't just the sirs that didn't see the Sun and the stars. Paul

668
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,060
didn't see it. Paul was in the midst of your Euclidean the same way everybody

669
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,260
else was. It wasn't that Paul was exempt from the storm. No, he was in the storm

670
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:03,420
with them. He was experiencing the same thing. He says be of good cheer. I believe

671
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:13,500
God. Notice what he says, that it shall be even as it was told me. Because God

672
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:20,940
always does what God says he will do. He always does. Remember when they came to

673
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:28,820
the tomb the angel said he's not here for he is risen. As he said. He always

674
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:35,020
does what he says. Our God is trustworthy. He's dependable. But the question is who

675
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,900
do we believe when we go to the Word of God and we read what God tells us in his

676
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,980
Word with regard to prophecy, when we regard to the end days, the times in

677
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,100
which we're living. Do we believe what God says? Do we believe that God is in

678
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,260
control? Do we believe that God's plan is coming to pass? Or do we fret and worry

679
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,380
and have fear and say everything's unraveling and everything's out of

680
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,860
control? No, no, no. We believe God. It's going to be. Listen, listen for the

681
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,380
trumpet. Jesus is coming. Amen. I don't know the hour. I don't know the day. But

682
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,740
it certainly appears each day. I mean, I know we're a day closer than we were

683
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,940
yesterday. But the reality is that, man, I said to Joseph yesterday we were

684
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,740
driving. I said, bud, listen for the trumpet, man. Jesus is coming. I believe

685
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:32,300
that he's coming. And here's why I believe he's coming right on time. I

686
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:40,580
understand that the Bible ends with, even so come Lord Jesus, right? And the

687
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:48,220
reality is that we might say, man, I wish Jesus would come today. And he could. But

688
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,020
you understand he's not coming on your timetable or on my timetable. He's coming

689
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,380
on his timetable. He's coming on time. He's not going to be early. He's not

690
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,580
going to be late. He's going to be on time. We find that Paul stands and says,

691
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,260
I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. Now I want you to

692
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,740
consider, as Paul makes this declaration, and I want you to consider that as we

693
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,780
would understand Paul standing in the midst of this difficulty, that he is

694
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:23,060
putting his full confidence in God. But you understand that he's putting

695
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:30,740
himself in a position where he's telling everybody else what God said. I mean he's

696
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,660
just, he's not in his little cabin by himself saying, I believe you Lord, I

697
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,020
believe you're going to deliver us. I'm just not going to tell anybody else because if

698
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:44,300
you don't, then you know I don't want to look bad. No, no. Paul believed God. It

699
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,420
wasn't like a, I believe you but I don't want to, I don't want to be wrong. No. He had

700
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,340
full confidence that what God told him, God was going to do. If you look through

701
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,060
the rest of the chapter, we don't have time this evening, I want to look at a couple

702
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,700
other passages, but if you look through the rest of the chapter you find that

703
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:12,860
they were delivered. They were delivered. The soldier's counsel was to kill the

704
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,660
prisoners according to verse number 42 and the centurion was willing to save

705
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,060
Paul, kept them from their purpose and commanded that they should not, that they

706
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,700
which could swim should cast themselves fast in the sea and get to land and the

707
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,060
rest, some on boards, some on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass

708
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:40,860
that they escaped, look at what it says, all safe to land. All of them. A mindful of

709
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:48,500
Hezekiah in the Old Testament. 2nd Kings chapter 18. We're going to run out of time this

710
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,860
evening but in 2nd Kings chapter 18, we're familiar with that which

711
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:00,740
happens during the reign of Hezekiah and during the reign of Hezekiah you find

712
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:12,060
that the Assyrians have taken Israel captive and they're seeking to now take Judah captive.

713
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:22,980
Sennacherib and Rabshakeh. Rabshakeh in particular is coming to the people of

714
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,500
Judah and it says in verse number 29, kind of jumping right in the middle here,

715
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,620
it says, well look at verse 28, then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the

716
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,620
Jews language and spake saying, hear the word of the great king, the king of

717
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:42,180
Assyria, thus saith the king, let not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be

718
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,500
able to deliver you out of his hand. You know that Hezekiah, I don't think he

719
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,660
ever believed that he could deliver the people. He knew that God could deliver

720
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,300
the people. There's a difference. Hezekiah is not standing up saying I'm

721
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,580
going to deliver you from the Assyrians. And you notice that the Bible says that

722
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,940
Rabshakeh as he's speaking with this loud voice in the Jews language that he

723
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,940
says this, hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. I want you to

724
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,420
hear the word of the king of kings and lord of lords, not the king of Assyria.

725
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:22,300
Notice verse 30, neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying the

726
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,940
Lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the

727
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,020
hand of the king of Assyria. Hearken not to Hezekiah, it says in the beginning of

728
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,660
verse number 31. But you understand that he continues and he says in verse 33,

729
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,940
hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his hand, excuse me, all

730
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,660
his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? They were idols. They are false

731
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:51,500
gods. Of course they didn't deliver. We serve the true God, the king of kings and

732
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,340
lord of lords. The Bible says that the people held their peace and answered him

733
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,500
not a word for the king's command was saying answer him not. If you go through

734
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,340
and you find as you come into chapter number 19 of the book of 2nd Kings that

735
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,380
Hezekiah when he goes up to the house of the Lord and he spreads out the letter

736
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,780
that was sent and he prays and he understands that God is the creator and

737
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:16,060
he is and understands a lot of things about God and he he demonstrates here

738
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,100
for us in this passage belief in what God is able to do. You know the end of

739
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:27,940
the story tells us in verse number 34 of chapter 19 for I will defend this

740
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,140
city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant David's sake. They came to

741
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,260
pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of

742
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,580
the Assyrians and hundred four score and five thousand and they arose early in

743
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,540
the morning behold they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria

744
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,480
departed and went and returned and dwelt Nineveh. His sons kill him in verse

745
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,480
number 37

746
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I mean, we could go on and on this evening with examples in the Word of God of what our God is able to do.

747
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,480
And where people, the people of God are brought to a place of decision.

748
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Are you going to believe God?

749
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Or are you going to believe whatever's on the other side?

750
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Whoever's on the other side?

751
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
It's best that we put our trust in God.

752
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,480
As believers, as the people of God, we are to believe God.

753
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Trust in the Lord how?

754
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,480
With all thine heart.

755
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
I'll be transparent with you this evening.

756
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,480
The last part of Proverbs 3 and verse number 5 is hard for me and probably for you as well.

757
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,480
And lean not unto thine own understanding.

758
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
We struggle with that, do we not?

759
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
We're human.

760
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,480
That's why God said lean not on your own understanding.

761
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
In all thy ways.

762
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
And how many of your ways?

763
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
All.

764
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Acknowledge Him.

765
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,480
And He shall direct thy paths.

766
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Who better to direct your path and my path than the almighty, all-knowing God?

767
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Amen?

768
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,480
This evening, when we understand who He is,

769
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,480
when we see Him in all of His glory,

770
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,480
when we see Him as Isaiah did in Isaiah 6, high, holy, and lifted up,

771
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,480
when we read of His attributes and the way in which He's described Himself,

772
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,480
but then the way in which He's displayed His attributes,

773
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,480
we stand in awe of who He is.

774
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,480
The psalmist said in Psalm 48,

775
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.

776
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,480
And he ends that chapter with saying, after a whole host of things about how great God is,

777
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,480
that this God is our God.

778
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Listen, He's trustworthy.

779
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,480
He wants us to believe Him.

780
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,480
He said in Numbers 14, when He speaks to Moses,

781
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,480
How long will it be ere my people believe me?

782
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I hope He's not saying that today.

783
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,480
I hope that He's not looking at 2021 Christians and saying,

784
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Aren't they believing me?

785
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
I've given them my word.

786
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,480
I've proven myself over and over.

787
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Why won't they believe me?

788
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,480
And I'll finish with the verse that I started with,

789
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,480
Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God.

790
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,480
I hope tonight that it would never be said, of you or me or of us,

791
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,480
that we did not believe God.

792
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,480
That we'd come to a place in our lives where we say,

793
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Bid me come to thee.

794
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Because that's what Peter said when he saw Jesus walking on the water.

795
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
He believed. Amen?

796
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I understand that Peter gets all kinds of criticism.

797
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
I understand that people talk about, well, he sunk.

798
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,480
He walked further than you did and I did and anyone else in that boat did.

799
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Amen?

800
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
He's human.

801
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
But he believed God.

802
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
And he had enough sense about Him to say, Lord, help me, save me.

803
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
And then he walked back to the boat.

804
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Tonight, we just didn't believe God.

805
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,480
I don't know in what area specifically in your life.

806
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,480
I know there's a lot of things going on in our world today.

807
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,480
I know there are a lot of voices that are trying to get your attention and my attention

808
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,480
and wanting to believe this thing and that thing.

809
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,480
But oh, if I could encourage you tonight to get into this book and believe God.

810
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Yeah, but the fill-in-the-blank is saying whatever they're saying.

811
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
But what did God say?

812
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,480
What did God say?

813
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Because I want to be on God's side.

814
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
Amen?

815
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
I want to believe God.

816
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Let's pray. Father, we love you.

817
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Thank you for loving us.

818
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,480
So many verses that I desired to get to this evening that I failed to do so.

819
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,480
The book of Psalms, the book of Proverbs,

820
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,480
admonition after admonition to put your trust in God.

821
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,480
To put your trust in God.

822
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
To believe is to trust.

823
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,480
To have faith.

824
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
I thank you tonight that you are trustworthy.

825
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I thank you tonight that you've never failed.

826
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:06,480
God, I pray that you would help me in my life to believe you more.

827
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Help us, God, to have confidence in knowing that you indeed are in control.

828
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,480
And that we can believe you.

829
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Help us to have that peace that passes all understanding.

830
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Help us to have the joy of the Lord. It's our strength.

831
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:38,480
I'm not sure exactly where this message applies in each individual's life that's present tonight.

832
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,480
But God, I pray that we'd be honest with you.

833
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,480
I pray that in the stillness and the quietness of the moment

834
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,480
that we'd truly allow you to have your way in our lives.

835
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,480
Help us to conquer doubt.

836
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Help us to silence those voices.

837
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Help us to run to you and to your word.

838
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,480
To trust you.

839
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,480
I thank you for what you'll do in the hearts of your people.

840
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
