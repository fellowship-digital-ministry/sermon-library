1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,199
13, and this morning we'll be looking at verses 7 through 17 from this passage of Scripture,

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,319
Hebrews chapter number 13.

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:13,600
And last week we looked at the first six verses of Hebrews 13, and we dealt with the behavior

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,040
of a believer, or of the believer, and we come now to this next section, and really

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,559
this is going to be a part one, part two for the next two Sunday mornings.

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,840
We would look at this passage and really finish up the book of Hebrews, and typically I am

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,200
scrambling to finish the book in which we are preaching from on Sunday mornings through

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,540
our themes, and this year I was sharing with Holly last night, I was planning to preach

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,159
from somewhere else for Thanksgiving, and I began to just meditate upon the last portion

10
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,439
of Hebrews 13, and very familiar with the truth in verse number 15, in fact it's where

11
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,919
we get our title for the message, where the Bible says,

12
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:58,720
"...by Him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,439
fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name, but to do good and to communicate, forget

14
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,040
not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,559
And from verse number 15, we've derived our title, Our Lips Giving Thanks to His Name.

16
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:18,080
Again, it will be a part one, and I was very familiar with this truth in verse number 15,

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,879
but we were ended last week in verse number 6, and I was kind of feeling like I was a

18
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,160
week off, you know, how do I go to verse 15 and then next week go back, and began to really

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,760
just meditate over the portion of Scripture that is before us this morning, and obviously

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,400
we are very familiar, most of us I would say, understand the biblical principle of giving

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,599
thanks, and we're familiar, no doubt, with the Old Testament children of Israel and their

22
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,360
constant murmuring, and how that often we would look to and see that sin of complaining

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,760
and murmuring, and we would obviously critique them, and understand that we're to learn from

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,000
their just bad behavior, poor behavior, and we're to give thanks.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,440
You read through the book of Psalms, and often you are reading and confronted with the way

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,279
in which we would praise and give thanks to our God and how wonderful He is.

27
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:13,639
Of course, we have been given instruction with regard to giving thanks as New Testament

28
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:20,199
believers in everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning

29
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
you.

30
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,240
And sometimes we can have difficulty in that everything part, right, and we say, well,

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,639
there are certain things that it's easy to give thanks for, but in everything, that's

32
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,279
a little bit challenging, that's a little bit difficult, but we understand that we serve

33
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:41,320
a God who is sovereign, who is good all of the time, and we know, as we look at the truth

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,320
in Romans chapter 8, that we know that all things work together for good to them that

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,199
love God, to them who are called according to His purpose, and so we are to give thanks

36
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,199
in all things.

37
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,320
And as we look at this portion of Scripture, and again, as I meditated on these verses

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,279
and began to really just spend time in this last section of Hebrews 13, I went through

39
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:07,600
and the Lord revealed to me ten particular things in which the children of God, the child

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,679
of God, should rejoice.

41
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,199
Ten reasons to rejoice in verses 7 through 25.

42
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,240
A couple of weeks ago on a Wednesday evening, I had ten points, and promptly realized after

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,639
the second point that there was no possible way I would get through all ten in one evening,

44
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,080
and so therefore, on the fly, I broke that message into two.

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,160
Well, I learned from past experience, and therefore, this morning, part one, we're only

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,520
going to look at the first five of these ten reasons to rejoice that we find as we

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,220
conclude Hebrews and looking at this thirteenth chapter.

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,039
Notice with me in verse number seven, the Bible says this, remember them which have

49
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:54,240
the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,199
the end of their conversation.

51
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,839
As we begin digging into the portion of Scripture, we notice in verse number seven the first

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,960
reason for us to rejoice, and that would be this, number one, for spiritual leaders.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,360
We find in verse number seven, the Bible says, remember them which have the rule over you,

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,200
who have spoken unto you the word of God, and then it says, whose faith follow, considering

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,480
the end of their conversation or their life, and we understand, even as the Apostle Paul

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,959
would have written to the church in Philippi, and he spoke to them about the things that

57
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,720
they had heard from him, but also the things that they seen in him do.

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,200
The reality is that spiritual leaders, we ought to give thanks for the spiritual leaders

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
that God has brought into our lives.

60
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,959
In verse number 17, the Bible says, obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves.

61
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,440
Notice what it says, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,640
they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.

63
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,559
Can I tell you this morning that verse number 17 is a heavy verse of Scripture.

64
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:08,519
It deals with one of the responsibilities of spiritual leaders, and that is that we

65
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,920
watch for your souls, and the Bible says they must give account, I mean, that is a weighty

66
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,959
truth of the word of God, and we find that the Apostle Paul, no doubt, as he would consider

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,679
spiritual leaders and spiritual leadership, he mentions about all of those things that

68
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:31,000
come upon him, and all of the outward things that he dealt with, and then he says this,

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,100
and the care of all the churches which comes upon me daily.

70
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,040
We think about spiritual leaders, we're familiar with the Old Testament, we understand how

71
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,440
God would lead his people, the children of Israel, and how he used men, he used leaders,

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,839
we can think of Moses as being a leader for the children of Israel, we can think of Joshua,

73
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,600
we can think of the period of the judges, and of course the prophets and the priests,

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,359
and we can think about that spiritual leadership that they would provide, of course, during

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,059
that particular era.

76
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:07,000
As New Testament believers, we understand this morning that the church is God's idea.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,359
The church is not man's idea, someone did not decide at some point in history, you know,

78
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,200
I think we ought to have a church.

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,679
The church is God's idea, God ordained the church, and he also instructed how a church

80
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,279
is supposed to operate.

81
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:30,000
He's given us in his word the truths with regard to the polity, the leadership of the

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,079
church, the ordinances in the church, the offices in the church, all of those things

83
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,359
we find that God has given us in his word.

84
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:43,920
And so we find that the church is God's idea, it's been ordained by God, and he has established

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,359
spiritual leadership.

86
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:49,799
I want you to turn back, if you will, to the book of Ephesians in chapter number 4, and

87
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:54,559
I want you to notice what Paul says to the believers here in Ephesus as we would think

88
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,920
about this truth of giving thanks, one, the first reason from this portion of Scripture

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,279
for which we should rejoice and thank God, give thanks to the Lord is for spiritual leaders.

90
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:13,160
In Ephesians chapter number 4, the Bible says in verse number 11, and he gave some apostles

91
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,320
and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers.

92
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,279
Notice what it says, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,

93
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,600
for the edifying of the body of Christ.

94
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,119
I know that this morning it's a little bit awkward, if you will, to be the pastor and

95
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:35,320
speaking about giving thanks for spiritual leadership or spiritual leaders, because I

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
am one.

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,880
However, I am thankful for the spiritual leaders that God put in my life, and as I began to

98
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,920
meditate upon this truth in Hebrews 13 and verse number 7 and verse number 17, and begin

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,640
to dig in and to see that the first of these reasons to rejoice, as we conclude Hebrews

100
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,679
13, is to give thanks for the spiritual leaders, I'm mindful of the very first pastor that

101
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:04,959
I ever met, that I ever remember meeting and having any amount of influence in my life,

102
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,040
was a man by the name of Rodney Paddock, and he was a pastor at Grace Baptist Church in

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,440
Jacksonville, North Carolina, and that's the church where my parents got saved.

104
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,079
And I remember he had a little Sunday school class in the back of the property in a little,

105
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,820
really like a little modular type trailer, if I remember correctly, and it was a new

106
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,980
believers class, and I remember for Sunday school that my parents would go into that

107
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,919
class and they would be instructed and they'd be taught, and Pastor Paddock was a man that

108
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,320
loved the Lord, he was a man that gave his life to influence others and to instruct them

109
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,239
in the Word of God, and what a great ministry he had.

110
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:48,479
Brother Paddock is with the Lord today, and he went home to be with the Lord many years

111
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:53,479
ago, but the reality is that there's still a church there that, to the best of my knowledge,

112
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:58,039
the last time I visited Jacksonville, North Carolina, and stopped by the church, I had

113
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:04,039
the privilege of meeting some of the folks there, and they have had a worldwide impact

114
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,159
through missions, because of the influence in the military, and of course in and out,

115
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,599
and so on and so forth.

116
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:15,440
A man that was a spiritual leader, I didn't get saved under his ministry, but man, he

117
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,840
influenced my parents and he instructed them, and I'm thankful for a man like Rodney Paddock.

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm thankful for a man like Palmer Sean, he was my pastor, you understand that he's been

119
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,840
here as an evangelist, he's in evangelism now, but God used Palmer Sean in my life,

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,239
and he was a spiritual leader.

121
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:40,080
As I was a senior in high school, just after I got saved, we began going to his church,

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,679
and as we were there at his church, it began to grow, and he took an interest in me, and

123
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,000
he began to encourage me and instruct me, and I felt like the Lord was calling me to

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,799
the ministry, and I didn't know what that meant, what that all looked like, and I remember

125
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:59,640
Brother Mershawn as a spiritual leader, coming and giving guidance and counsel and direction

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,039
and all.

127
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,039
So, even to this day, I still contact Brother Marshawn.

128
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,239
He's a spiritual leader in my life.

129
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,299
I could go on and I could mention other names

130
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,199
of spiritual leaders that God has given in my life,

131
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,639
and no doubt in your life,

132
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,359
you've had some spiritual leaders

133
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:22,399
that God has allowed you to be influenced by,

134
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,599
and we need to rejoice and thank God

135
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,559
that in His wisdom, in His plan,

136
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,959
not only did He ordain a church

137
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,919
and the church, but we find that He established

138
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,359
the leadership for the church,

139
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:37,239
and spiritual leaders, we ought to give God glory

140
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:39,879
and thanks for the spiritual leaders.

141
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,719
Think about this.

142
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,319
We see in Ephesians 4 that the Bible says

143
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:44,799
that He gave some apostles, some prophets,

144
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,659
some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers.

145
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:49,079
He tells the purpose for the perfecting of the saints,

146
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:49,999
for the work of the ministry,

147
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,919
for the edifying of the body of Christ,

148
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,519
and how blessed we are.

149
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,879
You know, there are churches all across the world,

150
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,319
and really, as we think about our nation,

151
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,439
as the United States of America,

152
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:03,039
there are churches all across this nation

153
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,519
that do not have spiritual leadership.

154
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,199
They're lacking pastors.

155
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,519
The office is vacant.

156
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,999
There are pastors that regularly resign.

157
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,839
I read statistics as you go through this year,

158
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,639
in 2020, and all of the things

159
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,559
that have been accompanied with this pandemic,

160
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,659
and they estimate that at least one quarter

161
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,979
of those in spiritual leadership will resign

162
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,419
by the end of the year.

163
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,259
That's sad.

164
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,379
There are churches, listen,

165
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,099
I remember preaching in churches just after Bible college,

166
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,819
and being in churches and not having pastors

167
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,899
and inquiring from them how long it had been

168
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,019
since they'd had a pastor.

169
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,019
Two years, three years, four years.

170
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,899
Oh, man.

171
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,299
Then you have some that are in the office,

172
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,619
but they're not fulfilling the office.

173
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,019
They're not preaching the Word of God.

174
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,899
They're not doing what God had instructed in His Word.

175
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:58,979
Notice what Peter says.

176
00:11:58,979 --> 00:11:59,819
You don't need to turn there,

177
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,859
but in 1 Peter 5, in verse number two,

178
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,339
Peter says, feed the flock of God.

179
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,739
He's speaking to the elders.

180
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,139
In verse number one, he tells us that,

181
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,059
the elders which are among you I exhort,

182
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,379
whom also an elder, the spiritual leaders.

183
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,499
It says, and a witness of the suffering of Christ,

184
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,879
sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory

185
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,599
that shall be revealed, feed the flock of God,

186
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,299
which is among you, taking the oversight thereof,

187
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,179
not by constraint, but willingly,

188
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,619
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,

189
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,639
neither as being lords over God's heritage,

190
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,999
but being in samples to the flock.

191
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,879
You remember that the early church,

192
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,359
in the book of Acts, as they were dealing

193
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:38,319
with various things that were accompanying the growth

194
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,999
and all that was going on,

195
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,199
and in Acts chapter number six,

196
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,239
there begins to have some internal uproars, if you will,

197
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,799
and we find that the disciples,

198
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,059
they say that they weren't gonna leave

199
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,299
the Word of God to serve tables.

200
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,519
Now, not that they were above the fact of serving tables,

201
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,079
but they said that they were gonna give themselves

202
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:01,279
continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word,

203
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,899
the responsibility to feed the flock of God,

204
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,719
and I would say this morning that as we look at Hebrews 13

205
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,199
and begin looking at these reasons to rejoice,

206
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,839
that it begins with identifying spiritual leadership

207
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,679
and thanking God for spiritual leaders.

208
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,439
Number two, if you're taking notes back in Hebrews 13,

209
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:23,079
look in verse number eight, the Bible says this,

210
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:28,079
Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever.

211
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,079
Reason number two to rejoice,

212
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,299
not only for spiritual leaders,

213
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,999
but number two, for the immutability of Christ.

214
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,639
I'm so thankful for the truth of the Word of God

215
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,399
with regard to this teaching that our God changes not.

216
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,399
The Bible says the same yesterday and today and forever.

217
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,619
You understand that everything around us changes.

218
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,659
Sometimes the changes are rapid, are they not?

219
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:57,339
Sometimes the changes are not the changes we had hoped for

220
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:58,879
or were looking toward,

221
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,059
but the reality is that we can rejoice in the fact

222
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,719
that we serve a God who does not change.

223
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,139
He is the same yesterday and today and forever.

224
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,339
Obviously, even as you look at the way

225
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,219
in which the verse is articulated,

226
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,499
you would find not only the immutability of God,

227
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,419
but the eternality of God,

228
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:21,979
the eternality of Christ that he is forever.

229
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:25,979
And what a joy to think about the truth of the immutability

230
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:27,579
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

231
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:30,119
Notice here in Hebrews 13,

232
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,099
the truth that says Jesus Christ,

233
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,259
the same yesterday and today and forever.

234
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,639
In Malachi chapter number three,

235
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,619
we find that the prophet of God is there

236
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,599
and he's prophesying, he's ministering,

237
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:45,159
and God is laying out some charges

238
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,919
and some indictments against his people.

239
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,939
And in verse number six of Malachi chapter number three,

240
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,399
notice what God says.

241
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,679
I am the Lord.

242
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,079
I change not.

243
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,419
I change not.

244
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:03,259
Therefore, ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

245
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,039
Aren't you thankful that our God does not change?

246
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,959
I've often said as I've meditated

247
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,399
and mentioned the truth,

248
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,039
the doctrine of the immutability of the Lord Jesus Christ,

249
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,119
how that it should cause us to rejoice greatly,

250
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:22,119
for we would be in a real terrible situation if God changed

251
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,079
and we didn't know how to approach him

252
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,039
because he changes from generation to generation,

253
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,759
from life to life.

254
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,839
And man, it'd be challenging, it'd be difficult,

255
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,759
but we understand that our God changes not,

256
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,399
the immutability of the Lord Jesus Christ.

257
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,399
And I hope this morning that as you begin to think this week

258
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,759
as we celebrate Thanksgiving

259
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,359
and we think about the principle of giving thanks

260
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,959
and praising God,

261
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,399
that we would find even here in Hebrews 13,

262
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,559
some real good reasons for which we should rejoice.

263
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,679
Number one, spiritual leaders.

264
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,479
Number two, the immutability of Christ.

265
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:58,639
Number three, back in Hebrews 13, I would say this,

266
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,279
we need to rejoice for the Word of God,

267
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,539
for the Word of God.

268
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:05,079
I'm so thankful for God's Word.

269
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,319
I mean, honestly, this morning,

270
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,039
as we think about this book that we hold in our hands,

271
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,199
you must understand that there are many people

272
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,279
that have gone before us that gave their lives

273
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,279
so that we could hold this book in our hands this morning.

274
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,399
You didn't have to give a whole lot of anything.

275
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,239
Maybe somebody even gave you the Bible

276
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,639
that you hold in your hands.

277
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,179
Maybe you purchased the Bible.

278
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,519
Maybe you have a real nice Bible

279
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,319
and you paid 100 or $150 for that Bible,

280
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,919
but you can go down to the dollar store

281
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,479
and get a Bible for a dollar.

282
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,019
In fact, if you need a Bible, we can give you a Bible.

283
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,459
We've mentioned that over the years.

284
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,019
We have Bibles downstairs.

285
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,019
And I remember a lady that came here a number of years ago.

286
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,039
She was just walking down Oakton Road

287
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,739
and she was from China.

288
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,819
And she saw the cross atop our sign

289
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,759
and then saw the cross on top of the fellowship hall.

290
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,419
She came walking up the driveway

291
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,499
and you could tell that she was just inquiring

292
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,239
as to what this building was.

293
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,419
And by seeing the cross,

294
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,179
she had assumed it was a church.

295
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:05,139
And Holly and I were here.

296
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:07,739
In fact, we were in the fellowship hall having lunch.

297
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,459
And we saw this lady walking up the driveway

298
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,819
and didn't know who she was

299
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,899
and went out and asked if she needed some assistance.

300
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,179
And she asked, is this a church?

301
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,259
And she was here because her daughter

302
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:21,059
was going to be going to school locally

303
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,179
as an exchange student.

304
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,339
She came into our church.

305
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,459
She said, can I come in and see?

306
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,139
And I said, absolutely, you can come in.

307
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:31,099
And she came here into the sanctuary in our auditorium.

308
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,859
And as she was standing in here

309
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,419
and she saw the cross here

310
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,299
and she was just kind of taking it all in.

311
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,059
And then back then there wasn't coronavirus.

312
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,379
And so we had Bibles in our pews.

313
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:43,539
You don't have Bibles in the pews anymore,

314
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,979
but there were Bibles in the pews.

315
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,659
And she saw one of the Bibles next to the hymnals.

316
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,219
And she said, is that a Bible?

317
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,779
I said, it is.

318
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,139
Can I see it?

319
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,419
I said, sure.

320
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:58,339
She said, I've never held a Bible before.

321
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,979
I've never seen a whole Bible before.

322
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,099
That's what she told me.

323
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,939
Mark, she was standing about two rows behind

324
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,939
where you're sitting this morning.

325
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,459
And she stood right there and Holly was standing with me

326
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,899
right here as we're talking to her.

327
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,779
And she just held onto that pew Bible.

328
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,259
And I said, would you like one of your own?

329
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,059
And you thought I'd give her a billion dollars.

330
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,099
I'm serious.

331
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,539
She said, really, I could have one?

332
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,779
I said, well, I'm not gonna give you that one.

333
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:25,779
I'll give you another one.

334
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,819
And I went downstairs and got a Bible

335
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,019
and brought it up to her.

336
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,380
At that time, Holly and the lady were standing

337
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,259
in the foyer chatting.

338
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,459
And she grabbed that Bible from me and she hugged it.

339
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,579
I mean, it was precious.

340
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,059
But this morning, see, we gotta give thanks

341
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,779
for the Word of God.

342
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,459
I mean, when you were getting ready

343
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,579
to leave the house this morning,

344
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:50,539
you probably grabbed your Bible to bring with you.

345
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,859
You're going to church to bring my Bible.

346
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,099
And I hope that you had some time this morning

347
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,219
before you came to church to open up your Bible

348
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,699
and read the Word of God

349
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,659
and that we understand how precious this book is,

350
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,380
that we understand this morning

351
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,579
that there are countless people around the globe

352
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,579
that do not have a Bible that they can go and open and read.

353
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,739
But yet God has seen fit to bless.

354
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,059
And we have the Word of God.

355
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,219
Notice in our text in verse number nine,

356
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,699
the Bible says this,

357
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:26,699
"'Be not carried about with divers in strange doctrines,

358
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,419
"'for it is a good thing that the heart

359
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,219
"'be established with grace, not with meats

360
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,500
"'which have not profited them

361
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,459
"'that have been occupied therein.'"

362
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,380
You say, pastor, where do you see the Word of God?

363
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,579
Well, the reality is that the Bible says

364
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,139
it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace

365
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,219
right after it says,

366
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,659
be not carried about with divers in strange doctrine.

367
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,779
And therefore I say, I need to give thanks

368
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,219
for the Word of God because of the Word of God

369
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,820
that is the source of sound doctrine.

370
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,779
I would be carried away with all sorts of false teachings

371
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,059
and strange doctrines if it were not.

372
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,939
for this book.

373
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,139
And so would you.

374
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,979
Why is it that we can travel to places around the globe?

375
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:12,299
Why is it that missionaries can go to places around the globe and they can find in various

376
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,419
groups of people strange, diverse and strange doctrines?

377
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,779
Because they don't have the Bible.

378
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,739
They don't have spiritual leaders that are teaching the Word of God, that are feeding

379
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,619
the flock of God from the Word of God.

380
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:30,659
I've often thought, I've said it probably a half a dozen times already this morning

381
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,139
about turning in your Bible, take your Bible and turn to the book of Hebrews and turn over

382
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,099
to this passage and so on and so forth.

383
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:41,899
There are people that do not have a Bible that are sitting in a church this morning

384
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:46,619
that have one person, the spiritual leader that has the Word of God.

385
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,819
He can't say turn in your Bibles.

386
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:54,579
We find that the Word of God is the source for sound doctrine.

387
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:59,499
All scriptures given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine.

388
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,539
I'm so thankful for the Word of God.

389
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:07,139
I'm thankful that because of the Word of God, not only is it the source of sound doctrine,

390
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:12,419
but we find that it says it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace.

391
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,599
I'm thankful that it establishes our heart.

392
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,579
That word established means to make firm or to make sure.

393
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:24,459
I mean to be established, not to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

394
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:30,019
No, to understand what thus saith the Lord, to have the Word of God.

395
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,500
Remember Paul often says as he's ministering to those that God would give them the opportunity,

396
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,099
he says, but I speak the Word of God to you and I would not have you be ignorant brethren

397
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,099
and so on and so forth.

398
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,299
And he's giving them the Word of God, why?

399
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,339
So that their hearts could be established, so that they could have some stability in

400
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,339
their lives.

401
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,939
They would not be tossed to and fro.

402
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:57,099
That's why it's so important that we understand this morning the preciousness of this book

403
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:00,500
and that we have it in its right place in our lives.

404
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,139
As Baptist people, we've often been referred to as people of the book.

405
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,979
By the way, that's a good thing.

406
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:06,979
Amen?

407
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:10,860
And we find that we look at the Word of God and as Baptist people, if someone were to

408
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,380
say what distinguishes you as a Baptist, many times our first answer would be that the Bible

409
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,979
is the sole authority for faith and practice.

410
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:22,339
What do we mean by that?

411
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:23,619
It's our final authority.

412
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,539
It's our only authority.

413
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:30,699
You can find religious organizations all over the world that say they believe the Bible,

414
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:35,860
but you would understand as you would dig in and you'd begin to evaluate and investigate

415
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,419
their teachings and their denominations, that the Bible is just one source.

416
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,020
It is not the source.

417
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,779
They look to some other writings, whether it's religious writings.

418
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:54,300
They look at various church fathers, if you will, and all of these things, and we say,

419
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,139
no, no, the Bible is our authority.

420
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:04,459
If what a theologian of yesteryear said lines up with the Word of God, I'm okay with it.

421
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:08,739
But if what a theologian from yesteryear said doesn't line up with the Word of God, then

422
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:12,059
we must side with God and His Word.

423
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,940
We say, sorry, man is fallible, but God is infallible.

424
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,339
And we look at the Word of God and we find in verse number nine that it is the source

425
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:28,419
for sound doctrine, that it establishes our hearts, that it helps us to have surety of

426
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:30,660
what it is that we believe.

427
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,300
When someone comes and asks you, what do you believe about this, and what do you believe

428
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,979
about that, and why do you do this, man, it ought to be that we can go to the Word of

429
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:44,539
God and share, here's why we do the things that we do, because here's what God said.

430
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:51,940
Verse 22, notice the Bible says this, and I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of

431
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,440
exhortation.

432
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,220
Notice what it says, for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

433
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
What's it referring to?

434
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,520
Well, this very book of Hebrews that we've been studying all year.

435
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,660
This is the letter that he's referring to.

436
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,440
And we look here, and I look at verse number 22, and of course, we're reading this and

437
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,080
understanding that this is part of the canon of Scripture.

438
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,359
This is the Word of God, but it had been written, it had been sent to these Hebrew, these Jewish

439
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,359
believers in the first century.

440
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,079
And I would say this, as I begin to think about the Word of God and the preciousness

441
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,880
of God's Word, and the reason that we ought to thank God for His Word, not only that it's

442
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,880
the source of doctrine and establishes our hearts, but it's available.

443
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,679
I've already mentioned by the story I gave you from the lady from China how that we ought

444
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
to rejoice that it's available to us.

445
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,200
I want you to notice what God says to the children of Israel back in the book of Deuteronomy,

446
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,579
if you will, in chapter number 30.

447
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:51,760
We find in Deuteronomy chapter number 30 that Moses is speaking here to the children of

448
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,600
Israel, giving them direction, and they're soon going to be entering into the land of

449
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
promise.

450
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,839
And as we look at Deuteronomy chapter number 30, we find out some important truth with

451
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,660
regard to the availability of the Word of God.

452
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,720
In verse number 10, the Bible says this in Deuteronomy 30 and verse number 10,

453
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,000
"...if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keep His commandments

454
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,119
and His statutes," notice what it says, "...which are written in this book of the law."

455
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,760
You understand that the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus,

456
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,600
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, this is the book that he's referring to.

457
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,000
You find in Joshua 1 and verse number 8, this book of the law, "...shall not depart out

458
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
of thy mouth."

459
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,959
And we see that he talks about the laws and the statutes, the commandments that are written

460
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:38,959
therein.

461
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:43,519
Notice in verse 10, "...and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart,

462
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,399
with all thy soul, for this commandment which I command thee this day," notice what it says,

463
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:53,720
"...it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off."

464
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,399
Aren't you thankful that God didn't hide it from us?

465
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:00,160
He made it available.

466
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,399
Again for us as being here in the United States of America and speaking English, that we have

467
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,359
the English Bible that's available to us, and how we ought to rejoice in the blessing

468
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,559
of God and giving us the Word of God, it's not been hidden from us.

469
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,040
Notice in verse number 12, "...it is not in heaven that thou shouldst say, Who shall go

470
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,639
up for us to heaven and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it?

471
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:31,160
Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the sea for us and

472
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,480
bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it?

473
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,799
But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest do

474
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,799
it."

475
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,880
You know one of the sad things when you think about the Word of God and the availability

476
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,720
of the Word of God and even thinking about the preciousness of God's Word and how we

477
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,959
ought to thank God for His Word, one of the things that's sad when we think about the

478
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:59,200
Word of God and speak about the Word of God is how often it's neglected.

479
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,839
How often it's neglected by people that profess to be believers.

480
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,839
You know there are statistics that are done all through the years and often you find that

481
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,119
there are many that are asked the question that profess to be Bible believers and they're

482
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,919
asked, have you ever read the Bible in its entirety?

483
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,119
And it's a very small percentage of people that say yes.

484
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,720
Oftentimes the Bible is neglected even by the very people that claim to believe it.

485
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,160
And that's a sad thing because God has given it to us that we would know it and that we

486
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,000
would do it.

487
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,399
And this morning as we look here in Hebrews chapter 13 and begin to focus upon the fact

488
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:49,679
that my mouth, our lips giving thanks to His name and we have reasons to rejoice and

489
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,119
the text of Scripture provides these believers with a number of them.

490
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,200
And this morning we say, listen, I need to give thanks to God.

491
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,239
My lips need to give thanks to His name.

492
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,839
Number one, for spiritual leaders.

493
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,959
Number two, for the immutability of Christ.

494
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,440
Number three, for the Word of God.

495
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,200
Number four, back in Hebrews 13, Lotus and verse number 12.

496
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,160
But let's read verse 10 through 12.

497
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,359
The Bible says in verse number 10, we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat

498
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,639
which serves the tabernacle.

499
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,440
For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high

500
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,559
priest for sin are burned without the camp.

501
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,519
So he's referring back to the Old Testament.

502
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,919
You can look in the book of Leviticus and see those things he's referring to.

503
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,679
Of course, often as we've studied through the book of Hebrews, we have found that the

504
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,960
writer regularly goes back to the Old Testament, that which these original recipients would

505
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,159
have been very familiar with.

506
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,559
And then notice in verse number 12, wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people

507
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,719
with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

508
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:58,599
Number four, if you're taking notes this morning, the fourth reason to rejoice is for the substitutionary

509
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,000
atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.

510
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,359
The fact that He went to the cross for you.

511
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,119
He took your place.

512
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,320
He paid a debt that I could never pay.

513
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Amen?

514
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,200
I mean, He took our place.

515
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,359
We can go back and we can think about the text of Scripture that record for us the trial

516
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,119
and the mockings and all that took place when Jesus was going to be led astray to go to

517
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,239
the cross of Calvary.

518
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:28,200
We understand that the Bible prophesies about the death that Christ would suffer and the

519
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,320
fact that Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, when He came that first time, He would come

520
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,440
as that suffering Lamb, if you will, to go to be that Lamb of God that would take away

521
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,039
the sin of the world.

522
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,200
And we find that through the trials, remember, as He's standing there and the accusations

523
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,320
are given, there was another one by the name of Barabbas.

524
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,840
And Barabbas was rightly imprisoned and Barabbas was going to be put to death.

525
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,799
You'll recall with me that there were three crosses.

526
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,080
There were two for the thieves.

527
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,960
one on either side of the Lord Jesus Christ and that third cross no doubt

528
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,180
would have been for Barabbas if you look through the text of Scripture and you

529
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,800
understand what's going on Barabbas was there and as you look at all that's

530
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,120
going on and Pilate is speaking to the the Jews that are bringing the

531
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,480
accusations and he says I find nothing worthy in this man of death they had

532
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,440
this tradition that they released one at this time and who is it that you'd

533
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:39,680
like for me to release Jesus or Barabbas what do they say release Barabbas Jesus

534
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:46,240
crucify him they cry out multiple times and I think about Barabbas I don't know

535
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,920
if you've ever thought about Barabbas but I wonder how much he knew about what

536
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,480
was going to happen and the the fate if you will of his own life and the

537
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,480
punishment for his own crimes but then he was released and Jesus hung upon that

538
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,400
cross he didn't hang on the cross just for Barabbas he hung upon the cross and

539
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,240
shed his precious blood for you and for me and for all of mankind the Bible says

540
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,960
that God hath made him Jesus to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be

541
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,680
made the righteousness of God in him we think about the substitutionary atonement

542
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,260
the fact that he took our place oh how we ought to rejoice this morning it we

543
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,760
sing about being saved I'm washed in the blood and so thankful at the cross even

544
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,480
as we sang I remember singing that song a number of years ago at the nursing

545
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,840
home there was a man from another country that was there with his wife and

546
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,560
he was fine his wife was not well and we sang that song at the cross and he

547
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:56,360
in all sincerity and he was steeped in a false world religion and he asked me

548
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,960
this question what is meant by cross at the cross what do you mean by that we

549
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,520
had sung the song and he heard the words but he did not understand see this

550
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,520
morning when we sang at the cross you had an understanding of what we were

551
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,440
singing about you understood that we were singing about that old rugged cross

552
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,480
on which Jesus Christ took your place and my place but this individual had

553
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,640
never even understood what is it that you mean at the cross and I had the

554
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,000
privilege of taking a Bible and sitting with this man and sharing with him what

555
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,200
is meant that the significance of the cross that Jesus Christ God in flesh

556
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,600
hung in shame and shed his precious blood so that you my friend could be

557
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,080
saved I wish I could tell you he trusted Christ he didn't at that moment and we

558
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,400
had future opportunities to continue to plant seed in and water and he never

559
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,480
trusted Christ his wife passed on and he did not stay at the nursing home after

560
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,720
that because he'd been there to visit with his wife but this morning as the

561
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,680
people of God I hope that we would rejoice in the substitutionary atonement

562
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,640
Revelation chapter number five turn over there if you will and Revelation

563
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,840
chapter number five and the scene in heaven that is given to us in Revelation

564
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,080
4 and 5 in particular is just a I mean a majestic scene I mean you begin to read

565
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,120
Revelation 4 and 5 and if that doesn't make you excited I'm not sure that

566
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,200
anything could make you excited and you read about that you read about what

567
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,280
we're going to experience and what heaven is going to be like and the way

568
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,720
in which we're going to rejoice and praise our God forever and ever and he's

569
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,000
worthy of it amen and the Bible tells us here in Revelation chapter number five

570
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,480
in verse number eight when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and

571
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,880
twenty elders fell down before the Lamb having every one of them harps and

572
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,120
golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints notice in verse

573
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,320
number nine and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book

574
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:11,600
and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by

575
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,440
thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has

576
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,480
made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth what a

577
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,240
joy as we think about the the song that is being rehearsed here in verse number

578
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,040
nine thou art worthy why for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy

579
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,160
blood what a joy we sing about redemption and we sing about redeemed

580
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,800
how I love to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of the Lamb listen when we

581
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,600
really understand redemption when we really understand what Christ has done

582
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,640
for us we ought to love to proclaim it amen why because the reality is that

583
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,520
when we understand redemption properly that we've been reconciled to God

584
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,160
because of the blood of Jesus Christ that no longer am I going to spend

585
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,880
eternity in the lake of fire but I have a home in heaven I mean that's amazing

586
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,380
it's miraculous what he's done for us and how we ought to rejoice in the the

587
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,580
reality of the substitutionary atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ I

588
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:26,420
often mention about reading the gospel records of the life and ministry of the

589
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,660
Lord Jesus Christ but as you conclude each of the Gospels you'll read about

590
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,220
the crucifixion the burial and the glorious resurrection I'm so thankful

591
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,580
that he rose conquering sin death in the grave when you read about the

592
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,820
substitutionary atonement when you read about the death of Christ on the cross

593
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,740
of Calvary I wonder how it impacts you wonder how it impacts me I wonder how

594
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,700
much how often it should be a daily occurrence perhaps multiple times in the

595
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,380
day that we thank God for our salvation that we thank God for the substitutionary

596
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,680
atonement because if he didn't go to that cross and pay that price we'd be

597
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:11,940
hopeless and helpless amen I mean just hopeless but praise God he went to the

598
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,940
cross he paid the price he declared it is finished this morning as we look here

599
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,980
at Hebrews 13 we're reminded of the substitutionary atonement as it tells us

600
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,540
here in verse number 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people

601
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,780
with his own blood suffered without the gate we see in the next few verses this

602
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,700
truth about rejoicing it says let us go forth therefore into him without the

603
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,980
camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one

604
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,460
to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God

605
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,540
continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to

606
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,820
do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well

607
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,980
pleased it pleases God when we praise his name we find the Bible says in verse

608
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,900
number 15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God what's

609
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:14,060
the next word continually right I have it circled in my Bible it's a constant

610
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,780
reminder to me that this is something that were to do continually this is not

611
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,820
something that we do once a year at Thanksgiving right there are some people

612
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,060
that have that idea that oh it's Thanksgiving we need to give thanks no

613
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,300
no as the people of God were to give thanks continually we have so many

614
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,020
reasons to rejoice and I believe that as we look at this chapter and we see these

615
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,860
ten reasons to rejoice and just looking at the first five this morning that it

616
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,660
helps us to understand that we're to give God thanks continually you

617
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,420
understand that as we've looked at these particular truths this morning these

618
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,820
reasons to rejoice spiritual leaders that's something that God has ordained

619
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,500
that God has given the instruction established spiritual leadership we

620
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,820
think about the immutability of Christ is there anything that's going to change

621
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:06,820
that I mean in its own word it changes not right I mean he's immutable he

622
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,900
changes not so can you not give thanks continually when you think about the

623
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,140
fact that our God changes not he's immutable it doesn't matter what your

624
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,300
circumstances are today or tomorrow or next week or next month there's a reason

625
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,700
to rejoice when we're mindful of the fact that the that our God changes not

626
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,180
that is immutable the third thing that we looked at the Word of God is anything

627
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,140
gonna change it I mean they might try to outlaw it in fact I read just this

628
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,260
past week how that there's some countries over in Europe that have upped

629
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,260
the ante so to speak on hate speech and you preach the Word of God and you're

630
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,220
gonna find yourself in jail in a number of those nations why because they're

631
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:53,340
they're saying the Bible is hate speech listen this book gives freedom it's sin

632
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:00,179
that that that bounds us that that binds us remember that Paul said that sin shall

633
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:07,220
no longer have dominion over you this book frees it gives liberty there are

634
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,420
people that try to outlaw it but can I tell you it's never gonna be outlawed I

635
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,580
mean I don't care what they say they're not gonna change it forever Oh Lord thy

636
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:21,179
word is settled in heaven amen I mean we got the book that's reason to rejoice no

637
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,540
matter what your circumstances are no matter what your challenges are I'm

638
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,500
rejoicing in the Word of God we find the fourth thing that we're just looking at

639
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,540
now the substitutionary atonement I mean it's a fact it's a reality it happened

640
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:41,580
Jesus died for you reason to rejoice I mean we think about this idea of

641
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,340
continually I think what happens so often and I know I've said this with

642
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:53,780
regard to the the truth of Psalm 150 where we are to praise God not only for

643
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:01,980
the things that he does but for who he is see sometimes I fear that

644
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:09,900
And even in my own life, but I think generally speaking, we are typically led to give thanks

645
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,260
based strictly upon our circumstances, the things that are going on.

646
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,100
But when we learn to rejoice in who our God is and what He has done, we will never lack

647
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,600
reason to rejoice.

648
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,700
Because though all the difficulties and all of the opposition that we might deal with,

649
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,960
we're looking at some things that are settled.

650
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,680
We're dealing with some principles and some reasons to rejoice that no one can change.

651
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,640
Number five, if you're taking notes, we've looked here that we're to rejoice for spiritual

652
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,440
leaders, we rejoice for the immutability of Christ, for the Word of God, for the substitutionary

653
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,560
atonement, and number five, for our home in heaven.

654
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,040
I'm so thankful for the reality of heaven.

655
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,840
Notice what the Bible says here in verse number 14.

656
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,640
For here, we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

657
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,360
Does this not remind you of what we've read earlier in the book of Hebrews?

658
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Remember back in chapter number 11, in verse number 13, when the Bible said these all died

659
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,360
in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off and were persuaded

660
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,600
of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

661
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,720
The Bible talks about the fact that they were looking for a better city, and it says

662
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,920
in verse number 14, for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country

663
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,040
for truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might

664
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,160
have had opportunity to have returned, but now they desire a better country that is in

665
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,040
heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared

666
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,280
for them a city.

667
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,200
Here in Hebrews 13, in verse number 14, it says for here we have no continuing city,

668
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,680
but we seek one to come.

669
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,160
You remember as we finished chapter number 12 a couple of Sunday mornings ago and looked

670
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,160
at verses 18 through 29, I titled the message, The Finish Line, and we spoke about the contrast

671
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,640
that is given there in Hebrews chapter number 12 between Mount Sinai and Mount Zion, and

672
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,880
the fact that we have this finish line for the believer, as New Testament believers,

673
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,240
this reality, this certainty of heaven.

674
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,480
I think this morning about our home in heaven, we sing about heaven, and we speak about the

675
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,920
role being called up yonder and when we all get to heaven and those sorts of things, but

676
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,520
daily in our lives do we daily remind ourselves that, listen, this world is not my home.

677
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,280
I'm just a passing through.

678
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,600
I'm a stranger in a pilgrim.

679
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,480
I have a home reserved for me in heaven.

680
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,960
And what a joy that is, how it helps us to keep our eyes upon the Lord Jesus Christ,

681
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
understanding our finish line.

682
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,660
Think about what Jesus said to the disciples in Luke chapter number 10.

683
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,120
These disciples had been given instruction in Luke chapter number 10 to go out.

684
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:16,080
They had been given instruction as they were to leave with regard to the ministry that

685
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,720
they were to be engaged in, and they come back, and they come back returning with joy.

686
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,680
In verse number 17 of Luke chapter number 10 tells us about how they returned.

687
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,320
Verse number 1 tells us about how they were sent.

688
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,360
And then verse number 17 says, and the 70 returned again with joy.

689
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
They're rejoicing.

690
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,080
They're returning with joy.

691
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Notice what they said.

692
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,160
Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

693
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Why?

694
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,400
Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

695
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,160
The name of Jesus is a powerful name.

696
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,320
Amen?

697
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,840
We find here that the Bible says, and he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall

698
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
from heaven.

699
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,520
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power

700
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,160
of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you, notwithstanding, and this rejoice

701
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
not.

702
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
You say, wait a minute.

703
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,040
This is what they're rejoicing in.

704
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,120
And Jesus is giving them an important truth.

705
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,320
He says, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice.

706
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Why?

707
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,480
Because your names are written in heaven.

708
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,560
Your names are written in heaven.

709
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,920
I see these folks returning with joy.

710
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,480
Now, in your mind, I mean, a group of 70 people, that's a pretty good-sized group of people.

711
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,840
I mean, it's not a huge group, but I mean, 70 that are coming, I mean, you're going to

712
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,600
notice them, right?

713
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,040
And you see these 70, they come and they're rejoicing.

714
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,920
In my mind's eye, my sanctified imagination, I see them coming.

715
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
They're not coming like this.

716
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,920
I mean, that's not coming rejoicing, right?

717
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,200
They're coming excited.

718
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,960
They're talking about what they've experienced.

719
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,640
They're talking about what they had just seen, and they're rejoicing.

720
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,680
They come back with joy.

721
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,080
Jesus says, listen, I want you to have joy because your names are written in heaven.

722
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:05,160
I wonder this morning, how often do we have joy just because we're reminded that our names

723
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,400
are written in heaven, that we have a home in heaven?

724
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,200
I mean, we just live like we're supposed to as Christians, right?

725
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,640
This world's not my home.

726
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
People look at you sideways.

727
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
They think you're crazy.

728
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I told you about the guy in the bank.

729
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
He looked at me, and things were bad.

730
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,040
I can't remember the exact circumstances, but some things had happened in our world

731
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,360
that were really just kind of troubling at that particular moment that week.

732
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,320
He looked at me, and he is just a grumpy old man.

733
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,080
You've met grumpy old men, no doubt, amen?

734
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
You know what I mean.

735
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,000
Your mind probably already got an image when I just said grumpy old man, right?

736
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
He's just a grumpy old guy.

737
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He's just standing there, and he was just doing his business, and he was just not happy

738
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,800
and very matter of fact.

739
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,840
He kind of looked at me and kind of like, what is this guy doing?

740
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
I said, how are you, sir?

741
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,240
I knew he wasn't doing well, and normally, I'm wiser than that.

742
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,240
What do I mean?

743
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,560
Well, normally, I don't like asking people how they're doing when they don't look so

744
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,800
good because I don't need their sob story.

745
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,320
You ever ask somebody how they're doing, and they just kind of dump a big old truck of

746
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
problems on you?

747
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,040
You're like, why did I ask him, right?

748
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
But I was in the bank.

749
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
I wasn't going to be there long.

750
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
I said, how are you doing?

751
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
He said, how are you?

752
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,160
I said, I'm absolutely wonderful.

753
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,640
That's Mr. Don Curry, by the way.

754
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,640
If you talk to Don Curry, I mean, every single time you ask him how he's doing, in the hospital

755
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
bed.

756
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,640
Brother Don, how are you?

757
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,640
I'm absolutely wonderful.

758
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
It's encouragement.

759
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,520
That's what he says.

760
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
You know.

761
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
You've met him.

762
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
You've talked to him.

763
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,520
Absolutely wonderful.

764
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,520
And I said, absolutely wonderful.

765
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
He said, you're lying.

766
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,080
That's what he said to me.

767
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,560
The man in the bank, he said, you're lying.

768
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,480
I said, I'm not lying.

769
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,120
I mean, that's kind of funny, right?

770
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,920
I'm like, I'm not lying.

771
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,080
He's like, how could you be absolutely wonderful?

772
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,440
I said, because I'm going to heaven.

773
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,840
And he kind of changed his countenance.

774
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,080
He said, you're dying?

775
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,440
Not that I know of, right?

776
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,160
I mean, like a little bit every day, I guess, technically, right?

777
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,200
But like, I don't think I'm dying today.

778
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,080
Like I'm not taking my final withdrawal kind of a situation, you know?

779
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,560
But the reality is that it could have been the day of my death.

780
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,360
You don't know when you're going to die.

781
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,120
I don't know.

782
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,360
And I said, well, I don't think I'm going to die today.

783
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,560
But I might.

784
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,960
But one day, I am going to die.

785
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,720
Because the Lord Jesus Christ took my place on the cross of Calvary, and he made it possible

786
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,080
for me to be redeemed, I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ.

787
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,320
He told me that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

788
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,560
And I accepted the gift of God, and I'm going to go to heaven when I die.

789
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,960
And he just looked at me like he had never heard something like that before.

790
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,400
I offered him a gospel tract.

791
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
He probably had not.

792
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,480
I think Mark just kind of had that idea.

793
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,760
He probably had not ever heard that.

794
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,560
A lot of people that never heard that truth.

795
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,960
And I offered him a gospel tract, and he took it.

796
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,880
He told me he'd read it.

797
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,960
Never heard from him.

798
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,080
I've never seen the man again.

799
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,760
But what I'm saying to you this morning is that, what if we lived our lives like that

800
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,760
every day?

801
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I'm going to heaven, man.

802
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,160
Listen, I understand there are some days that we all live under the circumstances, right?

803
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,140
I get it.

804
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:30,360
But these disciples, these 70 that are returning with joy, I wonder if we had joy in our lives

805
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,400
the way they did just because our names are written in heaven.

806
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,760
And I say just because, really, that's an amazing reality, that I'm going to go to heaven

807
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,920
when I die.

808
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,360
I don't know when it's going to be, but I have that hope, that certainty.

809
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,400
Again, it's not a hope like the world would use the word hope.

810
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
We often have spoken to people, and if you were to die today, are you 100% sure you'd

811
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
go to heaven?

812
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
I hope so.

813
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,640
Well, they don't mean it the way we mean it.

814
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,800
We talk about the blessed hope.

815
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
I mean, it's an assurance.

816
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
It's a certainty.

817
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Why?

818
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,240
Because of what Jesus said.

819
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,520
We find that he said this in John 14, let not your heart be troubled.

820
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,440
You believe in God, believe also in me.

821
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,720
In my Father's house are many mansions.

822
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,640
If it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you.

823
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,720
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself,

824
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,440
that where I am, there you may be also.

825
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,360
Man, hallelujah!

826
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,840
I'm going to go to heaven one day.

827
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,680
I mean, this world is not all there is.

828
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,400
Sometimes we live like it, right?

829
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,720
I mean, let's be honest and transparent.

830
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,640
We get so distracted by the things that are going on in our world that sometimes we're

831
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,200
not mindful of the fact that this world's not my home.

832
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
I'm going to heaven.

833
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,240
You know what Paul said to the believers in Philippi?

834
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,680
He tells them in Philippians chapter number three that their citizenship, their conversation

835
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,000
is in heaven.

836
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,720
In Philippians 3 and verse number 20, he tells them this, for your conversation is in heaven.

837
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,960
From whence also you look, we look for the...

838
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,400
Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. My citizenship is in heaven. Remember, the

839
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,760
Lord told us this, we look at it in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, that we

840
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,480
are ambassadors. What is an ambassador? It's a representative. See, this world is not

841
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,320
my home. I'm in the world, but I'm not of the world. Why? Because I've been saved.

842
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,360
I've been born again. And because I'm in the world, but not of the world, that

843
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,720
makes me an ambassador, and we are to be good ambassadors. We're to be His

844
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,000
representatives, and our citizenship, our conversation, is in heaven. We're seated

845
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,600
in heavenly places. The book of Ephesians deals with that truth. This morning, as we

846
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:46,400
think about this week of Thanksgiving, in no doubt there are many things you could

847
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,720
give thanks for, but as we look at Hebrews chapter number 13, and examine

848
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,560
the first five of these reasons to rejoice, I hope this morning that you'd

849
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,520
be encouraged when you leave here and say, listen, I know the world's

850
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,320
crazy. Amen? I've seen the things that are out there in the news. The world has

851
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,100
lost its mind. The world's crazy that we live in, but I'm thankful for spiritual

852
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:17,740
leaders. I'm thankful as we look at Hebrews 13, not only for spiritual

853
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,800
leaders, but I'm thankful for the immutability of Christ. Oh, all the things

854
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:28,040
around us are changing, but our God's the same, yesterday and today and forever.

855
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,560
The Lord says in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not. I'm thankful for the Word of

856
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:41,120
God. It comforts me. Oh, it convicts me, but it comforts me. I'm thankful that I

857
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:47,680
can just grab my Bible and read it, and just be encouraged. You know, you get a

858
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,600
little bit discouraged, you see the things are going on in the world, you just get

859
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,760
into the Bible. You just read about the plan that God has and how he's revealed

860
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,520
it to us. Meditate upon who he is. I'm thankful this morning for the

861
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:07,280
substitutionary atonement, that Jesus took my place. The cross reminds us of

862
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,000
that. By the way, the cross is empty. Why? Because he didn't stay on the cross. He

863
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,960
was buried and he rose in victory. He's seated in heaven. He ascended, as Acts

864
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,000
tells us and shows us. And then this morning, I'm thankful for our home in

865
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,920
heaven. This road is not my home, and it's not your home either. The wise man says in

866
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,520
Ecclesiastes that man goes to his long home. Every man goes to his long home.

867
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:41,440
Eternity, right? Every person's gonna die. As believers this morning, if you've

868
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,040
trusted Christ, you can rejoice that heaven is your home. And this morning, we

869
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,520
got some reasons to rejoice that nobody can change them. There are settled

870
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,480
reasons. We think about all the things that are changing. I say, listen, I'm gonna

871
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,720
rejoice in these things. Next week, we'll look at the next five. Let's pray

872
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,040
together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the Word

873
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,960
of God. We've mentioned this morning that that's one of the reasons that is given

874
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,760
here in Hebrews 13 for which we should rejoice, that we have the Word of God. It

875
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,680
establishes our hearts. It's the source of sound doctrine. It's available to us,

876
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,240
and I'm so thankful that we can go to the Word of God this morning. And we can

877
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:31,160
examine your Word and discover these reasons for which we should rejoice. Our

878
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:38,080
lips giving praise to your name. Lord, we know that you're pleased with our praise.

879
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:44,920
And I pray this day that you would help us to rejoice as we should, to praise you

880
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:55,360
as we should, to know that you're worthy as we travel this earth, as we think

881
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:03,120
about the chaos and the confusion. I pray, God, that you'd help us to have a joy

882
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:11,240
unspeakable, full of glory. Help us to rejoice greatly. The joy of the Lord is

883
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:21,960
our strength. I pray, God, that you'd help us to choose to focus upon these reasons

884
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:29,120
that no man can change. And help us to rejoice greatly. I pray, God, that you'd

885
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:35,160
bless the time of invitation, that you'd help us to make decisions, to be more

886
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,400
mindful of praising you and rejoicing in these things that you've done for us and

887
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:45,160
provided for us. God, if there's one present on our property or watching via

888
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:51,600
livestream that they do not know you as personal Lord and Savior, this truth of

889
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,360
the substitutionary atonement, they've never understood how that you took their

890
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:06,120
place. You suffered and bled and died, buried and rose in victory so that we

891
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,560
could be redeemed, reconciled to God. If there's one in that condition this

892
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,040
morning, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. Lord, I pray that

893
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,000
the Holy Spirit of God would work as only he can, that we'd be doers of the

894
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,120
Word and not hearers only. I pray that you'd bless the time for us in Christ's name, we pray.

895
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,600
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play

896
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,600
quietly on the piano and as she does, the altar is open. Maybe this morning you

897
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,120
just need to get along with God and thank him for some of these very things

898
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,640
that we looked at. Maybe there's some other things that God's impressed upon

899
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,360
your heart that you just want to thank him for. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
