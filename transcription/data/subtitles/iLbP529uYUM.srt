1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
11 is where we will begin this morning, 1 John 4,

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,960
beginning in verse number 11.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,360
Notice what the word of God says here

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,720
in our text of Scripture,

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,640
beginning there in verse number 11.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,520
Of course, last week we looked at verses seven through 10,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,079
and this subject matter of loving one another

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,620
is a recurring thought,

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,239
not only through the book of 1 John,

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,159
but really through the New Testament.

11
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,920
And we find that it begins here in verse number 11

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,760
of 1 John 4.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,579
The Bible says,

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,060
If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,240
It's pretty simple, isn't it?

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,500
I mean, very straightforward

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,200
with regard to the simplicity of the argument here

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,459
in understanding how we are to behave ourselves.

19
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,619
We are to be like Christ, amen?

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,319
And I'm so thankful to be the recipient of his love.

21
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,860
We dealt with that in great extent last week

22
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,979
of what a joy it is to know that God loves us.

23
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,099
Notice in verse 12,

24
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:57,060
no man hath seen God at any time.

25
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,900
If we love one another, God dwelleth in us,

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,740
and his love is perfected in us.

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,559
Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us,

28
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:10,459
because he hath given us of his Spirit.

29
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:13,019
And we have seen and do testify

30
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,459
that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.

31
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,220
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God,

32
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,180
God dwelleth in him and he in God.

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,059
And we have known and believed the love

34
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,300
that God hath to us.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,059
God is love, and he that dwelleth in love

36
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:32,300
dwelleth in God and God in him.

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,940
Herein is our love made perfect

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,739
that we may have boldness in the day of judgment,

39
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,099
because as he is, so are we in this world.

40
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,019
There's no fear in love,

41
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,379
but perfect love casteth out fear,

42
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:46,500
because fear hath torment.

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,599
He that feareth not is made perfect in love.

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,980
We love him because he first loved us.

45
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,379
If a man say, I love God and hateth his brother,

46
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,059
he is a liar.

47
00:01:57,059 --> 00:02:00,500
For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,080
how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,819
In this commandment have we from him

50
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,339
that he who loveth God love his brother also.

51
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,940
The title of the message this morning

52
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,940
from verse number 11, we ought to love one another.

53
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,740
Obviously, we understand that the New Testament

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,740
provides us with valuable instruction

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,500
as we consider the thought that is before us again

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,220
this morning of loving one another

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,979
and this truth that we are to love one another.

58
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,360
The reality is that there are times

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,100
in which we know what we ought to do,

60
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,699
but we don't do it.

61
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,580
Isn't that true?

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,300
There's a lot of things that we know that we should do

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,940
that it would be right for us to do,

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,360
but sometimes we struggle with actually doing

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,179
that particular thing.

66
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,740
And so we find that as we look at the New Testament,

67
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,380
I am thankful for the instruction that God has given us

68
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,339
with regard to the subject matter that is before us,

69
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:57,580
and I'm also thankful this morning for the examples

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,440
that God has given us in the scriptures

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,139
with regard to those that have taken the instruction

72
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,940
and applied it in their lives,

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,000
that they were doers of the word and not hearers only.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,580
We often mention and I often pray

75
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,119
as we open up our services,

76
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,380
I pray as I read my Bible daily,

77
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,059
I pray, God, would you open down mine eyes

78
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,600
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,360
I also pray, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth,

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,080
and I pray this, Lord, help me to be a doer of the word

81
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,339
and not a hearer only.

82
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,660
We find that the New Testament provides us with instruction,

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,520
but we also have the privilege of seeing those

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,300
that have applied such instruction in their lives.

85
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,699
We'll look at a couple of individuals

86
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,740
at the end of the message,

87
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,300
but I want you to consider by way of introduction

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,139
this morning, the church in Thessalonica.

89
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,300
The church in Thessalonica, if you were to go back

90
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,059
and look at 1 Thessalonians 4, verses nine and 10,

91
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,820
in those verses of scripture,

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,839
the believers in Thessalonica at this local church,

93
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:05,179
they are commended for their love one for another.

94
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,860
We find that Paul tells them that as he commends them,

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,539
he is understanding, as he's evaluated,

96
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,520
and he's heard of their love that they have one for another,

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,720
but after commending them, he then challenges them

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,000
with this thought in verse number 10,

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,420
that ye increase more and more.

100
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,519
In other words, don't be content or satisfied where you are

101
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,040
with regard to the subject of loving one another,

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,160
of this subject of brotherly love,

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,420
but increase more and more.

104
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,079
It's exciting, as you would read

105
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,839
the book of 2 Thessalonians,

106
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,239
and you would go in the first chapter,

107
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,559
the introductory of that particular book,

108
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,679
you find that in verse number three,

109
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,399
that as Paul is writing back to this church,

110
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,260
he commended them and then challenged them

111
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,399
with regard for their love one for another.

112
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,579
He then says this in 2 Thessalonians one,

113
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,600
in verse number three, he says,

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
their charity, love, of every one of you all

115
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:10,440
toward each other, listen to this word, aboundeth.

116
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,399
It aboundeth.

117
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,880
If you look up that word aboundeth,

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
it means to super abound.

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,399
I like that word.

120
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,100
And you think about this love that they had one for another.

121
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,320
Paul says, listen, I'm gonna commend you

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,440
as he's writing that first letter to them

123
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,500
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

124
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,480
He says, I commend you because you're loving one another,

125
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,839
but I wanna challenge you that you increase more and more.

126
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,200
And then as he writes again,

127
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,959
that second letter, he says, listen, I'm rejoicing.

129
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm thankful because your love, your charity,

130
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,519
one for another, it aboundeth.

131
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
Wow, that's exciting.

132
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,359
That's a group of believers that received instruction

133
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,519
and applied instruction.

134
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,380
They lived, they were doers of the word

135
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,480
and not hearers only.

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,320
As we look here in the book of 1 John

137
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,440
and we begin to, again, address the subject matter

138
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,000
that is before us of loving one another

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,399
and understanding that we ought also to love one another

140
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,220
as we're told in verse number 11,

141
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,019
I want you to consider just a couple of thoughts

142
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,320
this morning.

143
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Number one, if you're taking notes,

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,299
why should we love one another?

145
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,519
Number one, because of his love toward us.

146
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,059
Because of his love toward us.

147
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:29,040
I will not preach the entirety of the message

148
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,079
that I preached last week

149
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,619
because I spent a significant amount of time

150
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:34,359
dealing with the subject matter last week

151
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,880
that we are the recipients of the love of God

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,239
and I'm so thankful that I can rejoice on a daily basis

153
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,799
that God loves me.

154
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,399
I tell him every day, God, I love you

155
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,100
and I thank you for loving me

156
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,760
because I understand that I love him

157
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,079
as it says in verse number 19,

158
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,040
because he first loved me.

159
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,959
And I'm so thankful for the love of God.

160
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,359
And notice in verse number 11,

161
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:58,279
the Bible says if, the understanding is since,

162
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,279
God, notice what it says, so loved us.

163
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
Thankful.

164
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,839
As you think about that little word so,

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,799
you think about the significance

166
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,959
and you think about the way in which he is telling us,

167
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,079
we see it in John 3 in verse 16 as well,

168
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,440
for God so loved the world.

169
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,200
And he says here, beloved, if God so loved us,

170
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,399
we ought also to love one another.

171
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,799
Reminder of being a recipient

172
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,559
of the wonderful love of God.

173
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,160
You notice in verse number 16,

174
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,880
that the Bible declares there

175
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,600
that God is loved but prior to that,

176
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
notice as he begins in verse 16,

177
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,799
it says and we have known and believed

178
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:43,579
the love that God hath to us.

179
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,679
It's interesting, he starts,

180
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,279
he mentions it often and in fact,

181
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,679
just very quickly look at the fourth chapter

182
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,920
and just look at the kind of the separations

183
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,239
as I preach these messages in verse number one,

184
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,320
he begins by addressing them as what?

185
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,519
Beloved.

186
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,040
In verse number seven, he addresses them as beloved.

187
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,880
In verse number 11, he addresses them as beloved.

188
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,079
Understanding that we are the recipients

189
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,000
of the love of God.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,239
We love him because he first loved us.

191
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,559
He is the initiator.

192
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,959
And we ought to rejoice in that this evening,

193
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,839
this morning and when we think about this truth

194
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,920
of we ought to love one another, why?

195
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,279
Because I have received God's love.

196
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,279
We're mindful of the truth and we speak about forgiveness

197
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,320
and I'll mention a little more about forgiveness

198
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,640
as we get through the message this morning

199
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
because we're going to end with a number

200
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,320
of really applications, practical points

201
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
on how we can love one another,

202
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,000
but we're reminded for the basis of us forgiving one another

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,239
is the fact that I've been forgiven.

204
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:47,080
We can read that in Ephesians four in verse number 32.

205
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,559
And so why is it that I'm going to love one another?

206
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,719
Why is it that we understand,

207
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,520
yes, we've been commanded to do so,

208
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,320
but we've been the recipients of the love of God.

209
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,320
Therefore, to love one another.

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,239
Notice not only because of his love toward us,

211
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,640
but I want you to think about this

212
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,599
as we dig into the passage of scripture this morning

213
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,599
because of his love through us.

214
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:15,359
Not only his love toward us, but his love through us.

215
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,679
Hold your place here in 1 John

216
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,320
and go to the book of Romans if you will.

217
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,039
In chapter number five, we're gonna look at a couple

218
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,919
of verses of scripture dealing with this subject

219
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,119
of the love of God through us.

220
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm thankful for his love toward us,

221
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,799
but I'm thankful for his love through us.

222
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:36,039
He mentions in the text of scripture in 1 John

223
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,440
and we'll go back there in just a moment

224
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,640
about the Holy Spirit, the Spirit dwelling within us.

225
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
And I'm so thankful for that truth of the word of God.

226
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,919
In Romans chapter number five,

227
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,919
notice it begins in verse number one,

228
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,239
therefore being justified by faith.

229
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,559
By the way, that's the only way to be justified.

230
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,640
He says we have peace with God

231
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,960
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

232
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,119
I am so thankful for having.

233
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:07,239
peace with God. I'm thankful for the peace of God that passeth all understanding that I have as a

234
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:12,119
child of God, but what a joy to know that I have peace with God, and the only way to have peace

235
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:16,359
with God is through the Lord Jesus Christ. You ever hear somebody that says at the end of their

236
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:20,919
life, I've made my peace with God? You ever hear somebody say that? I've heard people make that

237
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,559
statement before. What do you mean by that? Because biblically speaking, there's only one

238
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,959
way to have peace with God, and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ. Listen, we don't have a

239
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:38,599
conversation and make a deal with God. We just don't. God's given us the truth, and we must obey

240
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:44,999
it. Notice in verse number two, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we

241
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:51,399
stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.

242
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,559
There's a whole message right there. Knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience

243
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,399
experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed. Notice what he says, because the love

244
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:14,119
of God is shed abroad in our hearts, how? By the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. You know that

245
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:18,519
I can't love people the way I'm supposed to love people apart from God loving through me,

246
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:25,319
and neither can you. You ever hear somebody say, I love them, but I don't like them?

247
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,039
That's just being fleshly and carnal. I'm being honest.

248
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,479
It's flesh and carnal. You've heard people say that. I have to love them.

249
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:46,279
If the Holy Ghost is in you, and He is, if you've been saved, the Bible tells us that the Spirit

250
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,719
dwelleth within us. Amen? The indwelling of the Holy Ghost. What a wonderful truth

251
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:56,359
of the Word of God. And the Bible tells us here in this verse of Scripture in Romans 5,

252
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:01,719
in verse number 5, that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is

253
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:07,159
given unto us. On Sunday evening, Galatians chapter number 5, if you will, Galatians chapter

254
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:13,080
number 5, Steve made mention of this particular verse in Galatians 5, in verse number 22, as the

255
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,720
Bible begins to describe the fruit of the Spirit, it begins with what? Love.

256
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,599
Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance against

257
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:29,799
such, there is no law. But we find that as we are walking in the Spirit and not fulfilling the lust

258
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,519
of the flesh, when we are having that fruit of the Spirit, then we have love. You know what's

259
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,000
interesting? It doesn't say the fruits of the Spirit. It's singular. It's something, when you

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,279
talk about the fruit of the Spirit, you can't go through the list and pick and choose which ones

261
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,919
you think you have because the fruit of the Spirit is, and this is how it's described, love,

262
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,639
joy, peace, longsuffering, you have all of it. So, if somebody says, well, I have the fruit of

263
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,679
the Spirit, I just don't love people. No, no, no, you don't have the fruit of the Spirit

264
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:02,919
because it's love, joy, peace, longsuffering. Sometimes we divide those up and we look at them

265
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,519
as being fruits, plural of the Spirit, but the Bible says fruit of the Spirit. This is how it's

266
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,919
described, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, etc. We can use descriptive terms all the time to

267
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,519
describe something or someone, and we use a variety of terms to describe it. Maybe a food,

268
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,720
maybe a house, a car, whatever it might be, an individual. We can use a number of different

269
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,679
terms to describe that person. It doesn't mean that as we're describing that singular item with

270
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,039
maybe a variety of terms that it's multiple items that we're describing. No, it's the same item,

271
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,159
but we're using multiple terms to describe it. We understand that. We do it all the time.

272
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,679
We find here the fruit of the Spirit is love. Notice with me as we go back to the book of 1 John,

273
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:50,759
it's all of those things that are mentioned, but we find that it begins with saying that

274
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,639
the fruit of the Spirit is love, and I'm so thankful of His love not only toward me,

275
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,159
but His love through me. Notice with me as I begin to think about the love of God through us,

276
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:07,479
I begin to think about the fact that it is powerful. Notice in verses 12 down through

277
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,959
verse number 16, notice how the Word of God tells us, no man hath seen God at any time.

278
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,160
If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. And He's going with

279
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,600
this recurring theme about the truth that God dwelleth in us. He says in verse 13,

280
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,919
Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.

281
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,320
Aren't you thankful for that wonderful truth? Listen, that's what makes His love powerful.

282
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:44,040
It's His love. It's His love through us. Here's somebody say, I just can't love them. You can't,

283
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,959
but God's love through you will enable you to love them. Notice in verse number 14,

284
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,239
He says, And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Savior of the

285
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:01,959
world. Isn't that wonderful? When you think about the truth of verse number 14, that they were

286
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:08,199
eyewitnesses and they do testify. We have seen and do testify. Testify of what? That the Father

287
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,239
hath sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. That's our responsibility. We've understood the

288
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:17,799
truth, and we are to testify. It says this in verse 15, think about the wording here,

289
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:24,760
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.

290
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:33,239
You can't buy the Holy Spirit. You accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. You acknowledge

291
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:39,399
that He is God, and then He gives us. It's the earnest of our inheritance. The Holy Spirit is

292
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,839
the earnest of our inheritance, and we receive the Holy Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, and God

293
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,720
dwelleth in me. Notice what He says in verse 16, And we have known and believed the love that God

294
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,000
hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

295
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,559
We find that when we think about the love of God toward us, we rejoice. Then we think about God's

296
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,199
love through us, that it's powerful. Think about this. Not only is it powerful, but it's impactful.

297
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,639
His love through us is impactful. We can think of it from a couple of different perspectives.

298
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,880
We can think of it from the perspective that we'll deal with in just a moment on others,

299
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,160
but I want you to think about contextually here the impact of God's love in our lives personally.

300
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,880
As His love is operating through us, notice what the Word of God says in verses 17 and 18.

301
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,079
Interesting verses of Scripture. The Bible says, Herein is our love made perfect,

302
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,559
that we may have boldness in the day of judgment. Do you notice that statement?

303
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,399
That we may have boldness in the day of judgment. You know, most people in the day

304
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:51,559
of judgment do not have boldness. They have fear in the day of judgment. But notice it continues.

305
00:16:51,559 --> 00:17:01,000
It says, Because as He is, so are we in this world. We're to be like Him. We know that one

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,600
day, and we'll look at it in just a moment, we will be like Him, but we're to be like Him now.

307
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:10,919
Listen, we're to be following the pattern, the example that Christ gave us,

308
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,600
and He loved. Remember John 13, He loved until the end.

309
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,519
When Judas comes in to betray Jesus with a kiss, he says, Friend.

310
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:30,040
Notice verse 18, There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear,

311
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,119
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

312
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,160
Contextually, as we look at verses 17 and 18, we begin to see how that as we follow the instruction

313
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,839
that God has given us that we're to love one another, the loving one another is God's love

314
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,799
through us. It's not us conjuring up this love in of ourselves. It's not us trying to

315
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:56,440
work something up. No, it's God living in us, and God flowing through us. And as we're loving like

316
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:04,600
He loved, as we're like He is, we have confidence. It says in verse number 17, it says that we may

317
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,040
have boldness in the day of judgment, because as He is, so are we in this world. And we can

318
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,119
have that confidence. We can have, we can understand the impact of God's love through us.

319
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,479
It's interesting, as you would look at a contrast between 1 John 4, 17 and 18, and back over to 1

320
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:28,040
John chapter 2. The Lord just brought this to my mind this morning. I was actually shaving this

321
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,440
morning, and I was thinking about the message that I was going to preach, and God brought this thought

322
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,640
to my mind with regard to this contrast between 1 John 4, 17 and 18, and 1 John 2 in verse 28,

323
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,799
because He says that I was just meditating. These verses of Scripture in verse 17 and 18 are

324
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,599
interesting verses of Scripture, powerful truth of the Word of God, that we would have boldness

325
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,359
in the day of judgment. But notice the contrast back in 1 John 2 in verse 28. It says,

326
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,679
And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He shall appear we may have confidence, notice what

327
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:09,080
it says, and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. Wow. There are some that will be ashamed

328
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,119
before Christ at His coming. It's just a sad truth of the Word of God and a sad truth of humanity.

329
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,719
There will be some that will be ashamed before Him at His coming. But I'm thankful this morning

330
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:28,359
that we can have that confidence. Notice what it says, little children, abide in Him. So, what's

331
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,839
the evidence of abiding in Him? Well, when we're looking at 1 John 4 and these verses of Scripture

332
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:38,359
of loving one another, I'm walking in communion with my Lord. We've been singing all week,

333
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:45,400
or all year, excuse me, our theme song, I walk and I talk with the King. What a joy,

334
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,119
walking in the light as He is in the light. Remember, as we mentioned all the way back

335
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,400
in the beginning of the year of that theme that we have, and we'd be mindful of considering the

336
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,000
truth that as I walk in the light as He is in the light, that I have fellowship with Him.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,039
But the Word of God says,

338
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,679
we have fellowship one with another.

339
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,119
Yes, we have fellowship with him,

340
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,039
but we also have fellowship one with another.

341
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,799
We're abiding in him as we're living as we ought to live,

342
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,659
he says, because as he is in verse 17 of 1 John 4,

343
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,679
so are we in this world.

344
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,119
Listen, we are to be his representatives.

345
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,119
People are to see the love of Christ through us

346
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,559
as we live here on this earth.

347
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,919
Is it true as you look at the life and ministry

348
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,119
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

349
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,759
as you trace the steps of the Lord

350
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,919
through the gospel accounts,

351
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,559
is it true that you see the love of God?

352
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,399
Absolutely.

353
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,959
You see his love on display.

354
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,159
Again, not only did he declare it, but he displayed it.

355
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,079
And we find that here it says,

356
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,659
because as he is, so are we in this world.

357
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,559
We understand that he then tells us

358
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,639
in 1 John 3, speaking about the return

359
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,279
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

360
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,599
that he says in verse two, beloved,

361
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,559
now are we the sons of God,

362
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,999
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.

363
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:08,239
But think about the now versus the shall be.

364
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,599
What are we now?

365
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,979
I understand that we still have the old nature, the flesh,

366
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,159
and there's enmity.

367
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,839
You read Galatians 5.

368
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,999
We looked at verse number 22, the fruit of the spirit.

369
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,399
Verses 16 and 17, walk in the spirit.

370
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,139
You shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

371
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:25,079
And you get into the fact of verse 17,

372
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,999
the flesh and the spirit,

373
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,579
they're at enmity one with another.

374
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,239
The works of the flesh are manifest,

375
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,439
and he lists them all out.

376
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,839
And then you get into the fruit of the spirit.

377
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,479
And think about this.

378
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,679
We know what we are now.

379
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,199
And we know, as he says in 1 John 4, in verse number 17,

380
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,759
that as he is, so are we in this world.

381
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,479
Listen, we're not gonna be in this world long.

382
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,319
Amen?

383
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,999
This world is not my home.

384
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,639
I'm just passing through.

385
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,919
That's what the songwriter said.

386
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,199
And what a wonderful little chorus that is.

387
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,359
When we think about the fact

388
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,939
that we're just strangers in pilgrims, amen?

389
00:21:57,939 --> 00:22:01,079
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

390
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,159
Glory, hallelujah.

391
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,159
This world is not my home, but as I'm here,

392
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,899
listen, I understand that now, as I'm here,

393
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:11,659
that I'm his ambassador.

394
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,399
I'm his representative.

395
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,859
I am his witness that people are to see Christ in us.

396
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,999
And as we're loving one another,

397
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,279
that impact that it has for us,

398
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,859
that we can have that confidence,

399
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,239
that we can have that boldness in the day of judgment.

400
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,079
Why?

401
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,799
Because we're doing what we're supposed to do.

402
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,559
We're abiding in him, and we're living,

403
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,879
if I could call it this, we're living the Christ life.

404
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,039
You say, well, that's being awfully prideful.

405
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,479
You know what Paul said in 2 Timothy chapter number four?

406
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,159
Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, by the way,

407
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,079
he said this, I am now ready to be offered

408
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,419
the time of my departure is at hand.

409
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:54,339
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,

410
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,819
I have kept the faith.

411
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,539
Paul is not being prideful.

412
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,219
He's completed what God's called him to do.

413
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:05,659
And then he says this, again, being mindful of the truth

414
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,379
that it's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

415
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,199
he says, henceforth, there is laid up for me

416
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,699
a crown of righteousness.

417
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,459
Well, that's awfully prideful of you, Paul,

418
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,419
to think that you're getting a crown.

419
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,939
It's not prideful.

420
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:20,579
God said there are crowns, and Paul understood

421
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,419
that his obedience would lead to,

422
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,179
he's gonna receive a crown.

423
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,139
And he says this, not for which the Lord,

424
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,379
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day,

425
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:32,019
and not to me only, but unto all them also

426
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,259
that love is appearing.

427
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,259
You can have a crown of righteousness as well.

428
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,299
Wonderful.

429
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,999
And so again, back to 1 John chapter number three,

430
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,299
we find that he says that we are the sons of God,

431
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,179
it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

432
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,379
but we know that when he shall appear,

433
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:56,259
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

434
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,659
Isn't that wonderful?

435
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,299
Thinking about that glorified state

436
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,299
that this mortal shall put on immortality,

437
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,819
that this corruption shall put on incorruption,

438
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,059
and we can just rejoice in understanding

439
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,139
the glory of heaven and all that will take place,

440
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:15,219
but we understand that while we're here,

441
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,339
we're to be like him.

442
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:22,539
When he shall appear, I'm gonna be like him, glorified,

443
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:26,979
but now as I'm living this life here on this earth,

444
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,379
I am to be like him because as he is,

445
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,799
so are we in this world.

446
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,739
We're to be like Christ.

447
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:40,379
And his love through us is impactful in our lives,

448
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,299
it gives us a boldness, it gives us a confidence,

449
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,919
it enables us not to be ashamed at his appearing.

450
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:51,179
Not only is it powerful and impactful,

451
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,059
but I believe that as we look at the word of God,

452
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:58,059
and we consider our love one toward another,

453
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,879
and we consider his love not only toward us,

454
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:05,879
but through us, that his love through us is observable.

455
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,119
It is observable.

456
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,659
Notice, if you will, in verse number 20,

457
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,139
verse 19, we've read before,

458
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,879
we love him because he first loved us,

459
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,899
what a precious truth of the word of God,

460
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,999
but then look at what he says in verse 20.

461
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:24,219
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother,

462
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,939
he is a liar.

463
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,299
Again, that's strong language.

464
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,339
It's the word of God.

465
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,219
Throughout the book of 1 John,

466
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:37,419
we have found many times where God is telling his people,

467
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,579
you can say whatever you wanna say,

468
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:44,459
but here's the evidence, the proof,

469
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,199
of what you say being true.

470
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:53,219
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother,

471
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,059
he's a liar.

472
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:00,579
The evidence, the litmus test, if you will,

473
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:03,659
and today we have people, I've mentioned about the truth,

474
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,939
and we see it in chapter number five,

475
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,459
we've seen it in John, we've mentioned it many times.

476
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,059
If you love me, keep my commandments.

477
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,819
People say, I love God, I love Jesus,

478
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,379
and they're not obeying the word of God.

479
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,859
Here he says, if you love God,

480
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,979
but you hate your brother, you're lying.

481
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,699
So if you hate your brother, you don't love God.

482
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,739
It's observable, notice what he says here.

483
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,759
For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,

484
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,239
how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

485
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,379
In this commandment, have we from him

486
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,619
that he who loveth God love his brother also?

487
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:33,419
Wow.

488
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,859
It's observable.

489
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:40,219
We find that Jesus said this in John 13,

490
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,099
in verse number 35, we're familiar,

491
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,579
as we've mentioned last week, verse number 34,

492
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,579
with the new commandment that Jesus gave,

493
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:50,459
but then he says this, by this shall all men know

494
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:54,939
that you are my disciples if you have love one to another.

495
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,139
You know, the church in Corinth

496
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,979
didn't do so well at that, did they?

497
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:03,819
There were divisions and schisms and all sorts of things,

498
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,739
but you know when you begin to really study

499
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:08,019
the book of 1 Corinthians in particular,

500
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,619
begin to study the people there at the church in Corinth,

501
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,599
you know why there were divisions and schisms

502
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,439
and all those going in?

503
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,659
Because they were carnal.

504
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,659
The Bible tells us that Paul says,

505
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,219
I can't write unto you as being spiritual,

506
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,979
but as carnal, as babes.

507
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,299
And so the love of God wasn't flowing through them,

508
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,899
they were at opposition and enmity one with another.

509
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:32,419
Listen, the world should see in us,

510
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,779
and they will know that we are his disciples

511
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,539
by our love one toward another.

512
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,279
It's observable.

513
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,259
So we begin to think about the love of God toward us,

514
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,779
and his love through us,

515
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,259
and we've had this recurring thought

516
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,139
that we ought to love one another.

517
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,979
So what is, this morning,

518
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,579
as we kind of finish up the message,

519
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,819
what are some practical ways,

520
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,799
what's some application that we can take in our lives,

521
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,419
and look at the word of God,

522
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:04,619
and say, here's how we practically fulfill

523
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,939
the instruction that we've been given to love one another.

524
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,919
I'm gonna give you three thoughts this morning

525
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,139
on how biblically we can love one another.

526
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,339
Notice the Bible tells us in Ephesians five

527
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,099
that we are to walk in love,

528
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,979
in Ephesians five, in verse number two.

529
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,519
I wanna give you examples of a couple of men.

530
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,259
I'm not gonna go to the book of Philemon,

531
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,659
I just talked through the book of Philemon

532
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:24,939
on Wednesday evenings.

533
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,139
But in verse number five,

534
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:29,259
the book of Philemon describes Philemon as a man

535
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,539
that loved the Lord and loved all the saints.

536
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:34,579
I want you to think about that.

537
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,619
It's consistent with what we're reading here in 1 John.

538
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,419
That if you love God, you're to love one another.

539
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,659
If you say that you love God,

540
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:43,299
but you hate your brother, you're a liar.

541
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,219
And so the Bible says of Philemon

542
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,739
that Paul is saying, I've heard about your love

543
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,979
that you have, not only your love, but your faith.

544
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,779
And the love, as he describes it, he says,

545
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:56,059
which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward,

546
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,099
notice what it says, all saints.

547
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,099
Not just the ones that you connect with best,

548
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,119
but love toward all saints.

549
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:07,959
Why?

550
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,899
Because we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

551
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,139
Amen?

552
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,139
And we find, it's very interesting, by the way,

553
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,619
it's awesome how God works,

554
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,419
but God is really, in this book of Philemon,

555
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,199
he's setting Philemon up for Onesimus.

556
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:29,199
You love all the saints, and now Onesimus is a saint.

557
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,039
Love him.

558
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,440
Amen?

559
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,839
Because you love all the saints.

560
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,079
But he didn't me wrong, he's forgiven.

561
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,919
Love him.

562
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,239
Powerful truth.

563
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,440
But I want you to look at the book of 3 John, if you will,

564
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,500
and I want you to look at what the Bible says

565
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,239
about a man by the name of Gaius.

566
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,759
And then I'll give you three points

567
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,119
on how we can practically apply in our lives.

568
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,880
What does it mean to love one another?

569
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,019
How is that observed?

570
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,159
How is that practiced?

571
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,339
in our lives. New Testament truth that we'll look at, three truths that we'll

572
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:11,019
look and examine, but look at what the Bible says here in 3 John, only one

573
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,659
chapter here, but begin looking at verse number five. We know that he's writing to

574
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:18,619
the well-beloved Gaius according to verse number one. Notice in verse number

575
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:27,099
five, he says, beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the

576
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:34,959
brethren and to strangers. Well, that's a high commendation, is it not? Notice he

577
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:39,719
continues, he says, which have borne witness of thy charity before the church.

578
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:43,319
Understand the word charity is synonymous with the word love. In fact,

579
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,919
the Greek word that is translated charity is actually translated love more

580
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,039
times in the New Testament than it's translated charity. It's the same Greek

581
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,359
word, and you find here that he's speaking of this love of this charity

582
00:30:54,359 --> 00:31:00,239
that Gaius has, and he says that he doest whatever he does, he does it

583
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,279
faithfully, and he says this not only to the brethren but to the strangers, which

584
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,119
have borne witness of thy charity. Notice what it says, before the church. So in

585
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:14,639
your mind's eye, see what's happening as John is writing to this Gaius, this

586
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,319
well-beloved Gaius. He says to Gaius, he says, listen, there are people that have

587
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,479
stood up and give testimony before the church of your love for the brethren.

588
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:31,679
Isn't that awesome? Because it was what? It was observable. It was God's love

589
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,279
working through Gaius. He had been a recipient of the love of God, he had been

590
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,599
saved by the very grace of God, and he now, as the Holy Spirit of God would

591
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:46,919
indwell him, he's now loving that love of God working through him. It impacted his

592
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,559
own life, it was observable. They gave testimony, continue in verse number six,

593
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,799
which if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do

594
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,779
well, because that for his name's sake they went forth taking nothing of the

595
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:06,079
Gentiles, we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellow helpers to

596
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,439
the truth. And we find that Gaius understood it, he was allowing the Lord

597
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:15,039
to work through him, and what a great testimony of this man Philemon, and then

598
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,719
of this man Gaius, and we see the truth of the church in Thessalonica that we

599
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:23,599
used by way of introduction this morning, and now we look at these two individual

600
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:29,639
believers that were loving one another. It says of Philemon, just a couple of

601
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:36,799
verses later in that text of Scripture, how the bowels, the emotions of the

602
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,599
brethren were refreshed by him. Wow. So how do we do it? Three simple thoughts

603
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,239
this morning on how do we love one another. Number one, pray for one another.

604
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:54,239
Pray for one another. Go to the book of Philippians, if you will. I want you to

605
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,999
look in the first chapter, and I want you to see what the Apostle Paul says to

606
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:02,359
this church in Philippi as he's writing to them and seeking to not only

607
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,919
instruct them but to encourage them. And we come to Philippians chapter number

608
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:15,879
one, and I want you to notice what Paul says in verses three and four. In

609
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:21,319
Philippians chapter number one, beginning in verse number three, the Bible says,

610
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:27,839
"'I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always, and every prayer of mine for

611
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,919
you all, making request with joy.'" So is Paul praying for the believers at

612
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:38,959
Philippi according to verses three and four of Philippians 1? Sure he is. He says,

613
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:43,079
"'I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,' he says, "'always, and every prayer of

614
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,119
mine for you.'" He doesn't just say, "'and every prayer of mine,' and leave it blank. No,

615
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,799
he's praying for them specifically. But why is he praying for them? Notice in

616
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,839
verse number 17, even as—sorry, verse number 7, here in Philippians 1 and verse

617
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,439
number 7—'even as it is mean for me to think this of you all,' notice this next

618
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:14,679
phrase, "'because I have you in my heart.'" Because I have you in my heart. Because I

619
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,559
love you. Because I have you in my heart, I have you in my head. And that's why I

620
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:28,359
thank God on every remembrance of you, and that's why I'm praying for you. He

621
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,399
continues in verse number 7, "'inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense

622
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,079
and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. For God is my

623
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,919
record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.'" Wow. Why is

624
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,759
Paul longing for them? Man, because he has them on his heart. He loves them. He loves

625
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:57,239
these believers in Philippi. And because of his love—listen, we say, we're to love

626
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,879
one another. Okay, so if I love you, what does that mean practically? It means I'm

627
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:10,199
praying for you. That's an expression of my love, of your love, one for another, is

628
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:17,959
that we're praying one for another. You know, sometimes it ought not be the case, but sometimes

629
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:25,559
people seem to not appreciate prayer in the sense that they—you might tell somebody

630
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,199
you're praying for them, but they really are looking for something in their mind that's

631
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:37,839
more than prayer. You know the greatest thing I could ever do for anyone is pray for them?

632
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:47,519
To pray for them. As we invest time in prayer, I've sat in situations over the years, I promise

633
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,039
you, and I would never go into details, but I have sat in situations over the years that

634
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,719
it would have been so much easier for me to give somebody a check and tell them to get

635
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:04,879
out of my office than for me to spend time with them and for me to pray with them and

636
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:08,999
for them. It would have been so much easier to just write them a check and say,

637
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:16,119
hallelujah, goodbye. I'm not being unkind by saying, I'm just saying it'd be easier.

638
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,479
And some people would rather have a check because they think it's something that's

639
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:24,119
more significant that's going to help them. But the greatest thing we could ever do for

640
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,599
anyone is give them our time, and then if we're giving them our time by praying for them,

641
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,839
what a great investment of our time, what a great evidence of our love for them,

642
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:45,279
that I'm investing my time with the Lord in prayer on your behalf. Wow. Paul says,

643
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:52,359
you're in my heart, so I'm praying for you. I long to see you. Listen, if there's somebody

644
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:58,559
that you long to see, it's not because you don't like them. He longs to see them because

645
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:07,759
he loves them. Notice not only do we pray one for another. I would say this, New Testament

646
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:12,719
truth with regard to the practical application of what does it mean to love one another? It

647
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,599
means that we serve one another. It means that we serve one another. Go to the book of Galatians,

648
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:38,519
if you will, in the fifth chapter. Galatians chapter number 5. Galatians 5 and verse number

649
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:46,519
13, this idea of serving one another. You know, we live in a time and an era where people would

650
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,679
rather be served than serve. Do you agree with that this morning? We live in a time,

651
00:37:52,679 --> 00:38:02,079
we live in an era where people would rather be served than serve. But as New Testament believers,

652
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,999
as we understand this truth of loving one another, notice what Galatians 5 and verse 13 says,

653
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:13,279
for brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.

654
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:22,679
Notice what he says, but by love serve one another. By love serve one another. He says,

655
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,799
for all the laws fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

656
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:32,839
I'm going to read to you a verse from the book of Hebrews in the sixth chapter. You don't need to

657
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,399
turn there. But in Hebrews chapter number 6 and verse number 10, the Bible says, for God is not

658
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,879
unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name,

659
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:51,279
in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister. He's not talking about here of their

660
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:57,399
service to God, although that's important and that shows that we love him. But he says of your work

661
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:04,399
and of your labor of love, and how is that known? He says in that you have ministered to the saints

662
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:14,239
and do minister. So, not only past tense, have you ministered, but you're actively ministering. Glory.

663
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,639
That's because we love one another. Think about the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter number 13,

664
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:27,259
a wonderful passage of Scripture that deals with not only the love, but also the humility of the

665
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:32,440
Lord Jesus Christ being a servant. It's in that text of Scripture in John 13 where Jesus washes

666
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:41,759
the feet of the disciples. The lowest of low tasks that could be given to anyone, and Jesus

667
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:54,959
washes the feet of the disciples. Yes, we see his humility, but we see that he's a servant. He's a

668
00:39:54,959 --> 00:40:00,199
servant. It begins in John 13 by saying he loved them until the end.

669
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,559
And it ends in John chapter number 13

670
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,539
by Jesus saying,

671
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:05,339
a new commandment have I given you

672
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,219
that you love not as yourself,

673
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:12,479
but you love as I have loved.

674
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,519
So if we're going to love one another,

675
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,899
if we're going to apply the truth

676
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:18,199
that we've been studying,

677
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,279
that we've been reviewing,

678
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,739
that we've been confronted with,

679
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:23,859
it will look like prayer.

680
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,899
It will look like service.

681
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,839
And then let me say this,

682
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:29,899
there are many others.

683
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,059
But number three,

684
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,359
forgive one another.

685
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:35,659
Forgive one another.

686
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:36,699
From the book of Ephesians,

687
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:37,539
if you will,

688
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,059
in the fourth chapter,

689
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,459
I referenced a moment ago,

690
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:41,299
verse 32,

691
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:42,739
and I told you we'd come back to it.

692
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,159
I did not read the verse.

693
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,659
But I want you to look here

694
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:49,299
in Ephesians chapter number four,

695
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:52,039
verse two and verse number 32,

696
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,579
with this subject of forgiving one another.

697
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:57,779
In Ephesians four and verse number two,

698
00:40:57,779 --> 00:40:59,379
the Bible says with all lowliness

699
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:01,179
and meekness with long suffering

700
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:03,579
for bearing one another in love.

701
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:05,139
And he goes through all sorts of things

702
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:06,219
that we're to do

703
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,959
as we study through this chapter.

704
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,799
And then of course,

705
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,779
you come to the end of the chapter,

706
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:10,939
he's dealing with put off,

707
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:11,859
put on,

708
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:14,899
and that principle of walking in the spirit.

709
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,539
And he comes to verse number 32,

710
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:17,379
and he says,

711
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:18,859
and be kind one to another.

712
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,139
Notice this word,

713
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:21,579
tender hearted,

714
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,819
forgiving one another,

715
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:27,699
even as God for Christ's sake

716
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:29,019
hath forgiven you.

717
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,779
Let me ask you this morning,

718
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,059
are you thankful that you've been forgiven?

719
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,499
Wow.

720
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:38,259
So thankful to be forgiven.

721
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:41,899
You know,

722
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:47,019
the people that should have no problem with forgiveness

723
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,559
are the ones that have been forgiven.

724
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,399
Honestly.

725
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,899
We've been forgiven.

726
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:54,739
Listen, I didn't earn,

727
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,859
I didn't deserve forgiveness.

728
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,939
God offered me forgiveness,

729
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,939
even though I didn't deserve it.

730
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:05,979
Because he loved me.

731
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,539
For his God who is rich in mercy,

732
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:14,559
a God who loved me with great love,

733
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,819
he offered me forgiveness.

734
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:18,559
I didn't deserve it.

735
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,919
And we're to forgive one another.

736
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:23,079
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Peter chapter number four.

737
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,779
We'll close with this verse of scripture this morning,

738
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,179
as we consider the practical application.

739
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,539
What does it look like to love one another?

740
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:35,059
Well, if we're gonna love one another,

741
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,659
we're gonna pray for one another.

742
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:37,499
If we're gonna love one another,

743
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,299
we're gonna serve one another.

744
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:40,139
If we're gonna love one another,

745
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:41,739
we're gonna forgive one another.

746
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,139
In 1 Peter chapter number four,

747
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,939
in verse number eight,

748
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:49,919
notice how he says,

749
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:54,919
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves.

750
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,359
For charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

751
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:06,559
Let me try to, as best I can,

752
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,599
quickly explain this verse of scripture.

753
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,799
It does not carry with it the idea

754
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:16,039
that charity sweeps sin under the carpet.

755
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:21,159
You're never gonna find that in the New Testament.

756
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,959
But the idea is that as God would forgive them,

757
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,799
then I have charity love

758
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:30,839
that I'm going to forgive them as well.

759
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:35,519
Charity covereth the multitude of sins.

760
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,639
It's not a situation where I love them,

761
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,559
so I'm gonna let them do whatever they wanna do.

762
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,439
They can sin and it's just all okay,

763
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,279
and so on and so forth.

764
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:44,919
No, there's gonna be judgment for that.

765
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:48,439
God, listen, God is a righteous God,

766
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:52,319
but he's a loving God, and God forgives.

767
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,879
And I'm so thankful that he forgives.

768
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:57,799
And as we have fervent charity one with another,

769
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:00,119
accordingly it says in 1 Peter four in verse number eight,

770
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,479
then he says that charity covereth the multitude of sins.

771
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,079
That's a wonderful truth of the word of God.

772
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,939
I'm so thankful that as you read the book

773
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:15,299
of 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians,

774
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,499
that Paul addresses a sinful situation

775
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,019
in the book of 1 Corinthians,

776
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:23,299
a situation that was so egregious

777
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:26,999
that he says it's not even named amongst the Gentiles.

778
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,099
Wicked behavior that's taking place

779
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,579
in the book of 1 Corinthians.

780
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:35,719
Evidently, as you read the book of 2 Corinthians

781
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,739
and you see what's taking place,

782
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:38,639
evidently that man got right with God.

783
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:44,019
You know what Paul tells those believers in Corinth?

784
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:44,859
Forgive them.

785
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:49,019
And then just after that, he talks about the fact

786
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,199
that we're not ignorant of Satan's devices.

787
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:58,359
Oh, he'd love to use bitterness to harm you and to divide.

788
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,459
But Paul says, that brother was forgiven,

789
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:02,619
then you forgive him.

790
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:06,019
You look at the difference between 1 Corinthians

791
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:08,219
and 2 Corinthians on dealing with that brother,

792
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,719
I mean, hey, deal with it.

793
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:13,419
Don't sweep it under the rug, deal with it.

794
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,219
But as they got it right and they had forgiveness,

795
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,259
then you too offer forgiveness.

796
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,499
See, we're to have fervent charity, one toward another.

797
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,859
If we're going to love as we ought to love,

798
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,059
we ought to love one another.

799
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:30,899
It's one thing to know it,

800
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:33,259
it's another thing to practice it and to do it.

801
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,319
We see God's love toward us and how we ought to rejoice.

802
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,459
We see God's love working through us.

803
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:44,259
It's not my love, it's God's love through me.

804
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,859
And God is the one that enables me to love.

805
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,979
It's a powerful love because it's God's love.

806
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:53,419
It's perfected in us, the Bible says.

807
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,419
It's a love that's impactful.

808
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,819
It helps me to have that opportunity

809
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:02,219
to have boldness and confidence because as he is, so am I.

810
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:04,499
It's observable.

811
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:08,339
If you say that you love God but you hate your brother,

812
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,259
you're a liar.

813
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:11,599
It's observable.

814
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,619
By this shall all men know that you're my disciples.

815
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:15,459
What is this?

816
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,019
You're loved one for another.

817
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,499
But then practically, okay, we understand,

818
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,139
but how do we do it?

819
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:25,419
Where's the rubber meet the road?

820
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:28,419
Three New Testament truths.

821
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:32,279
Pray, pray one for another.

822
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:33,739
Listen, if you say that you love somebody

823
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:35,839
but you're not praying for them,

824
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,459
I would personally recommend you evaluating that

825
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:42,059
because Paul said you're in my heart

826
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,299
and that means you're in my mind

827
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,099
and that means you're in my prayers.

828
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:48,819
Serve one another in love.

829
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,819
God's not gonna forget our service of love,

830
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,299
our labor of love as you did minister

831
00:46:56,299 --> 00:46:59,799
and as you continue to minister and then forgive one another.

832
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:05,319
Three practical ways that our love one for another

833
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,999
is evidenced in our daily lives.

834
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:09,879
Father, we love you.

835
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:12,299
We thank you for loving us.

836
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,999
We thank you for the precious word of God.

837
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,579
We thank you for the instruction that you've given us.

838
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,719
We thank you for your love toward us.

839
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:22,479
As we think about the message this morning,

840
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:25,159
we're thankful for your love through us.

841
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:26,839
And God, I pray that you would help us

842
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:28,699
to love one another as we ought.

843
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,879
Help us to apply the truth in our lives.

844
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,879
Help us to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

845
00:47:35,879 --> 00:47:37,839
Maybe there's one that's never trusted Christ

846
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:38,679
as their savior.

847
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,199
Oh, how we would rejoice in their salvation.

848
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,719
Maybe this morning someone needs to come

849
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:47,079
and just thank you, Lord, for your love toward them.

850
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:48,659
God, maybe this morning we need to come

851
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,199
and ask you to help us to love as we ought to love.

852
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:53,999
That we'd abide in you,

853
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,319
that we'd walk in obedience to your commands,

854
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,239
to your ways, that we would be like you.

855
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:00,639
That we would love as you love

856
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,279
because it's your love working through us.

857
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,519
I pray that you'd have your will and way

858
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,899
in these moments of invitation.

859
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,199
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

860
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,039
Would you?
