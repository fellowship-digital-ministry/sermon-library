1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,239
in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 9 and we dealt with this subject matter,

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:11,520
striving to please my Savior. I wonder over the last week since we had that message, I wonder

3
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:18,319
how you did in striving to please your Savior last week and understanding that each day we

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:23,520
have opportunity to live for Christ and what a privilege and what a blessing that is.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,079
And I hope that as you look back at your week last week that you could say with confidence that

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:35,279
I live to please my Lord. If not, then there's time to get it right, amen, and to have the

7
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:40,000
confession and forsaking and getting right with the Lord. It's interesting as we look at this

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,279
portion of 2 Corinthians chapter 5, it seems like we made real fast progress through the beginning

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:50,159
chapters of the book of 2 Corinthians and then we got into chapter 4 and 5 and we just really

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,000
kind of throttled back and really it's the way that the book is kind of gives us the content,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,040
what have you, and we get into this section and how important it is that we grasp the truth

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,400
that we are given here particularly at what we'll look at this morning but really in the greater

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
context of the last couple of chapters. Of course, the Apostle Paul started talking about the

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,080
beginning of chapter 4. We have this ministry and what a joy it is to be engaged in the work

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,480
of the Lord and what a joy it is to know that those of us that have been saved by the grace of

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,959
God, we have been given the responsibility and the great privilege to be his ambassadors, his

17
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,559
representatives, to be his witnesses, and what a joy that we've been given as we'll see in just a

18
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:40,239
couple of weeks, the ministry of reconciliation and what a joy that is that we can share with

19
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,120
others how they too can know the Lord as their personal Lord and Savior. In the last couple of

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,239
weeks we've been here in chapter number 5 and we've noted really the focus of Paul. You end

21
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,040
chapter 4 and he talks about the importance of having an eternal perspective and immediately

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,879
after mentioning that he begins talking about heaven and what a glorious truth that heaven

23
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,879
is a certain reality. If you're here this morning and you've trusted Christ as your personal Savior,

24
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,240
it's not by works of righteousness which we have done, it's by the grace of God that we could be

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,679
saved and what a joy and blessing that he took my place on the cross of Calvary. He was buried and

26
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:23,440
he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave. He offers to every human being the free gift of

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,559
eternal life and I'm so thankful that someone shared that message with me and that I put my

28
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:34,559
faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary and heaven is a reality, it is a certainty.

29
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:40,160
In fact, Paul says it this way, that in verse number 8, we are confident, I say, and willing

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,759
rather to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord. After talking about heaven for

31
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,919
those first eight verses, he turns his attention on the importance of living to please our Lord.

32
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:58,399
He says, wherefore we labor in verse number 9, that whether present or absent we may be accepted

33
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:06,399
of him, literally the idea of striving, of laboring, of working, exercising as he says in

34
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:13,440
Acts chapter 24, for what purpose? To be well pleasing to our Lord. It's not so that I can be

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,720
saved, that's already settled at Calvary, it's not so that I can stay saved, I'm eternally secure

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,800
in the hand of my God, it's simply so that I can please my Lord. After speaking about heaven and

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,559
the impact in Paul's life of having that goal of pleasing his Lord, he now addresses an event

38
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:40,880
that is future. We do not know, as you think about here as Paul's writing about this and we see

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,800
his eternal perspective, we know that Paul is speaking about this future event and I believe

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,839
this morning the event that is the focus of our study this morning is impactful when properly

41
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:58,160
understood. It's important to note that both in the book of 1 Corinthians and again in the book of

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,960
2 Corinthians, so the church in Corinth receives these two letters that become part of the canon

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,000
of scripture from all scriptures given by inspiration of God. Paul is the human penman to

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,520
write these letters and in both letters this event that we're going to look at this morning

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,079
is addressed in both of them. We find in 1 Corinthians he mentions it again here in 2

46
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,959
Corinthians he mentions it and I wonder this morning what kind of an impact it had on the

47
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,440
members of the church. I wonder this morning as I think about and I begin to consider the church in

48
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,040
Corinth, a church that's divided, a church that's carnal, a church that's got all kinds of problems,

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,920
but Paul is writing to them. God is interested in them. God wants them to to get things taken

50
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,920
care of and to get things right and to please the Lord and we find that God uses Paul to mention

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,239
this event in both letters and I wonder how they received it. I wonder this morning did they believe

52
00:04:56,239 --> 00:05:06,160
it to be true. Is everything in the Bible true? Every word of God is pure. Amen. Paul was not just

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,399
making something up to try to use as a motivation. No, he's speaking to them truth and I wonder this

54
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,600
morning did they really believe it? I wonder this morning did the truth of the event that we'll look

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,399
at in just a moment, did it alter their behavior at all? Did it alter their behavior at all?

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,079
I wonder if it motivated them in any way. If you're familiar with the text of Scripture,

57
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
I've not read any of the verses yet that we'll look at this morning, but the event that we're

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,359
speaking of is the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment seat of Christ. And that second question

59
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:47,519
that I asked this morning as I consider the church in Corinth, I've asked myself and I'll ask you to

60
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,600
ask yourself this morning as well and that's this, does the truth, the reality of the judgment seat

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,480
of Christ, has it altered your behavior at all? Has it had an impact on how you live the life that

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:10,559
you're living? Has it had an impact? The truth of these verses of Scripture is impactful. Oh yes,

63
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:17,519
it's a motivator, no doubt. But the reality this morning that I, that you, if you're saved this

64
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:25,679
morning, you will one day stand before the Lord Jesus Christ. How has it impacted us? How has it

65
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:31,760
altered my behavior? How has it caused me to ask questions with regard to even considering last

66
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:41,839
week's message, will this decision please my Lord? Will this decision to do X, Y, or Z please my Lord?

67
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:49,040
Because I'll stand before Him one day. I'll stand before Him one day. I have never stood in a court

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,799
of law before a judge. I actually hope I never do. But I can only consider just for a moment,

69
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:05,600
standing before an earthly judge, the fear that would couple that. I saw, and I don't mean to

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,359
embarrass him, but I saw Fernando as he was holding the mic this morning, his hand was

71
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:13,040
shaking a little bit. And if you were up here singing for the first time, your hand would shake

72
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,399
a little bit too. Why? It's intimidating. But standing before an earthly judge, who's a human,

73
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:33,600
is a scary thought. But standing before the Lord God Almighty, the all-knowing, all-wise God,

74
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,880
the one who has all power, He knows not only what you do, but why you do it.

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Wow. It ought to alter our behavior. It ought to impact how we live our lives daily.

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,720
Because the reality is that we will stand before God. Notice with me in verse number 10. We'll

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,359
read verses 10 through 13, get into the message this morning. For we must all appear before the

78
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:06,720
judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he

79
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,880
hath done, whether it be good or bad, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord. We persuade men,

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,079
but we are made manifest unto God. And I trust also are made manifest in your consciences,

81
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,040
for we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf,

82
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,080
that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart. For whether

83
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,000
we be beside ourselves, it is to God, or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. This morning,

84
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,840
the title of the message, very simply, the judgment seat of Christ. Number one, if you're

85
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,880
taking notes, the reality of the judgment. Note with me the reality of the judgment. Remember the

86
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,520
book of 2 Corinthians as well as the book of 1 Corinthians is a book that's written to believers.

87
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,400
It's a book that's written to a church in Corinth that is made up of individual believers. And we

88
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,599
find that these people that Paul is writing to, it's interesting even as he writes to them

89
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:08,880
in various aspects of speaking about their conversion. You can go back to the book of Acts

90
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,080
and you can see where the gospel comes into the city of Corinth and how God used Paul and so on

91
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,919
and so forth. And you find here that these people had accepted Christ as their personal Savior.

92
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,960
And now as Paul is writing and we see the reality of the judgment, the book is written

93
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:34,960
to believers and he says, for we, Christians, believers, for we, referring to the redeemed,

94
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,039
this morning, if you're saved, you're going to be part of this judgment.

95
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,359
If you've trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you'll be part of this judgment. By the

96
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,640
way, if you're not saved this morning, there's just two categories of people, people that are

97
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,359
saved and people that are lost. Before August 31st, 1997, I was in the category of being lost. I did

98
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:59,440
not know for sure with certainty that heaven was my home. But on that glorious day, I understood

99
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
with a reality.

100
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,380
a reality that I'd never comprehended before,

101
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,780
that I was a sinner in need of the only Savior,

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,120
and I placed my faith in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

103
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
And I no longer was dead, I was quickened,

104
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,620
I was made alive spiritually, I was born again.

105
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,060
And now, because of that, I'm saved,

106
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,940
I know that heaven is my home,

107
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
but I will be one of those that will stand

108
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,040
at this judgment seat of Christ.

109
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,580
The lost, however, will stand at a different judgment.

110
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm thankful that I won't be at that judgment

111
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,620
as a subject of the judgment.

112
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,980
The Bible clearly teaches in Revelation chapter 20

113
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,360
that there's another judgment,

114
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,720
it's called the great white throne judgment.

115
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,860
And the great white throne judgment is for those

116
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,720
that have never accepted Jesus Christ

117
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,100
as their personal Savior.

118
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,500
In fact, when you read the end of chapter 20

119
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,840
of the book of Revelation,

120
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,700
it's one of the most difficult passage of scripture

121
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,440
to read and to comprehend and understand

122
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,200
that they will be cast in a lake of fire,

123
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,400
and it's the second death.

124
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,260
That's the result of that judgment.

125
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,840
But I won't be at that judgment as a subject

126
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,140
because I've been saved.

127
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,080
But I will be at the judgment seat of Christ.

128
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,180
And here this morning, when we understand,

129
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,780
he says we, he's referring to the redeemed.

130
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,420
Notice he uses this word, we must.

131
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,380
We must.

132
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,920
You're not gonna escape it.

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,380
The reality of the judgment,

134
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,680
the certainty of the judgment is that we must.

135
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,980
You're not gonna escape it.

136
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,920
You ever been in a situation,

137
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,160
I remember being in school,

138
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,420
and maybe you can think about this in some other context,

139
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
but I remember being in school

140
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,860
and the teacher's gonna ask questions,

141
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,160
and how many say, I hope they don't call on me.

142
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,440
I hope they don't call on me.

143
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,060
I hope they don't call on me.

144
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,200
And maybe you get through class and the teacher,

145
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,080
the professor never called on you,

146
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,500
and you said, man, I avoided that.

147
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,480
I didn't get called on.

148
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,640
No, no, we must.

149
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,140
And then notice the next word, all.

150
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,200
We must all.

151
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,280
Every believer, not a one,

152
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,040
will be excused from this judgment.

153
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,680
Not a one will be excused from this judgment.

154
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,480
And he says, we must all, notice,

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,480
appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

156
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,260
We find here, notice over in 1 Corinthians, if you will,

157
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,140
and chapter number three,

158
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,540
and as you look in 1 Corinthians three,

159
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,780
and hold your spot in both of these passages,

160
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,260
we'll bounce back and forth.

161
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,740
I mentioned by way of introduction

162
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,620
that Paul writes to the church in Corinth

163
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
in both of the letters speaking about the same event.

164
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,220
And we find in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

165
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,060
in verse number 10, notice the Bible says,

166
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,380
according to the grace of God,

167
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,460
which is given unto me as a wise master builder,

168
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,080
I have laid the foundation, another buildeth thereon,

169
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,060
but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

170
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,860
For other foundation can no man lay,

171
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,500
than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

172
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,580
Now, if any man build upon this foundation,

173
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,020
gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,

174
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,860
notice verse 13, every man's work shall be made manifest.

175
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,780
Do you see?

176
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,820
We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,

177
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,500
as he says in 2 Corinthians five and verse number 10.

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,780
And now here in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

179
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,860
you read in verse 13,

180
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,220
every man's work shall be made manifest for the day,

181
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,380
speaking of the judgment seat of Christ,

182
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,860
shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire

183
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,420
and the fire shall try every man's work

184
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,020
of what sort it is.

185
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,420
Romans 14 and verse 10, you don't need to turn there,

186
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,280
but Romans 14 and verse number 10 says it this way.

187
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,580
It says, for we, at the end of the verse,

188
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,040
shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,000
The reality of this judgment.

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,280
We understand this morning that the apostle Paul,

191
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,200
after already sharing in the book of 1 Corinthians,

192
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,880
this truth and these believers having an understanding

193
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
of this, he gets into it here

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,520
in 2 Corinthians chapter five.

195
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
Now, I want you to consider just for a moment,

196
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,460
again, the structure and the context

197
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,680
of what we've been reading.

198
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,360
And he rejoices about the ministry that we have.

199
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,040
And yes, we've been given a ministry.

200
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,520
We looked in chapter three of 2 Corinthians

201
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,640
and we found the great contrast between the law and grace.

202
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,720
And we understand the glory of the new

203
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,460
and that it giveth life and all of the blessings.

204
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,840
And then Paul says, man,

205
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm gonna be with my savior forever.

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,720
I know, I have confidence.

207
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,640
Mortality will be swallowed up of life.

208
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
And he's rejoicing.

209
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,080
And then he says, we're all gonna appear

210
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,820
before the judgment seat of Christ.

211
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I think the excitement leads to a level of sobriety.

212
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,680
The excitement, I'm gonna go and be with Jesus forever.

213
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,340
You're gonna stand before Him.

214
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,640
The sobriety of that truth,

215
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,080
the impact this morning of the reality of this judgment,

216
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,200
it ought to shake every believer to their very core.

217
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,680
How often I talk to individuals that say,

218
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,200
well, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven.

219
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,320
And they decide they're gonna live like this

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
and skip church and skip this.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
And don't read their Bible and don't pray

222
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,880
and don't give and don't,

223
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,820
and I'm just gonna go to heaven.

224
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
Oh, you're gonna suffer loss

225
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,840
when you stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

226
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,440
And we'll get to that in just a moment

227
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
and look at the context.

228
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,480
But I understand as I look last week

229
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
at striving to please my savior,

230
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,940
the reality is that why is Paul laboring?

231
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,720
Why is Paul exercising?

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,360
Why is he striving to please his Lord?

233
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,320
Because he recognizes with certainty

234
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,420
that yes, I will stand before Him and give an account.

235
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,760
And it's a scary truth.

236
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,480
The reality is that when we understand this this morning,

237
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,200
I don't think, and I'll ask the question

238
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
at the end of the message this morning,

239
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,420
are you ready for it?

240
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,320
But I don't think any of us can probably really say,

241
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,780
I'm ready to stand before Christ.

242
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
But you understand, it will happen.

243
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,340
There are people that speak about dying with no regrets.

244
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,380
And oftentimes they speak in the context

245
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,100
of having regrets one toward another

246
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,620
through a human relationship.

247
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
But I wonder this morning how often we think

248
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,060
of not having any regrets on that day

249
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,820
when we stand before our savior.

250
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Because once we take that final breath here on earth,

251
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,540
there's no more opportunity to be in that state

252
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,300
and there's no more opportunity to do the things

253
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,200
in this body that we're commanded to do.

254
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,360
We have just a little bit of time to please our savior.

255
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,060
The reality of this judgment.

256
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,780
Number two, the reason for the judgment.

257
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,180
The reason for the judgment.

258
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,940
Let me first start by saying what it is not.

259
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,320
What this judgment is not.

260
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,060
This judgment is not a judicial hearing

261
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,940
and it is not for sin.

262
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,900
And for that I can rejoice.

263
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,660
The truth of the matter this morning

264
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,820
is that sin was judged on the cross of Calvary

265
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,060
when the father poured out his wrath upon the son.

266
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,060
And we understand that Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

267
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,220
took my place, took your place.

268
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,940
He bore the sin of the world.

269
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,220
And I'm thankful for that this morning.

270
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,740
I'm thankful this morning.

271
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,780
The Bible says in just a few verses here

272
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,700
at the end of 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

273
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,060
for he hath made him to be sin for us

274
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,500
who knew no sin that we might be made

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,580
the righteousness of God in him.

276
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,580
The truth of the imputed righteousness of Christ.

277
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,980
And I didn't understand all of that on August 31st, 1897

278
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,940
when I trusted Christ as my savior,

279
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,700
but there was a great transaction that took place.

280
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,300
And Christ's righteousness was imputed upon my account.

281
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,860
And when you got saved, the same thing took place.

282
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,660
And he gives us promises such as this,

283
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
that I'll remember no more.

284
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,420
As far as the East is from the West and so on and so forth.

285
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
And we begin to understand this morning,

286
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,420
the truth of this judgment and what it is not.

287
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,020
The judgment seat of Christ is not for your sin.

288
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,260
Notice with me, if you will, again,

289
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,060
in verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians chapter five,

290
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,420
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,

291
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,700
that everyone may receive the things done in his body

292
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,980
according to that he hath done,

293
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,980
whether it be good or bad.

294
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,700
We'll get into just a moment what it is,

295
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,260
but when we deal with what it is not,

296
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,980
why do I know that it's not being judged for sin?

297
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,260
Well, let me share a few verses with you.

298
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,860
Number one, John chapter five.

299
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,580
Notice what the Bible says in John chapter number five

300
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,820
this morning in verse number 24.

301
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,540
John chapter five and verse number 24,

302
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,380
the Bible says this,

303
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,059
verily, verily, I say unto you,

304
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,739
he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me

305
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,700
hath everlasting life, notice this,

306
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,660
and shall not come into condemnation,

307
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,540
but is passed from death unto life.

308
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,940
When I got saved, when you got saved, that's what happened.

309
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,420
It says, he that heareth my word and believeth on him

310
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,179
that sent me hath everlasting life.

311
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,420
And there, the result is that he shall not come

312
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,540
into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life.

313
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,700
Remember the truth of Romans chapter number eight

314
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,900
in verse number one, and what a glorious truth it is

315
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,500
where the Bible tells us of those again,

316
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,780
of us that are saved, it says,

317
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,780
there is therefore now no condemnation to them

318
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,140
which are in Christ Jesus,

319
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,020
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.

320
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,940
And I'm thankful that I don't have to give an account

321
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,179
for my sin, my sin's been taken care of by Christ.

322
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,659
It's been taken care of.

323
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,659
It's under the blood.

324
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,259
In fact, we've had the opportunity to sing that song on more than one occasion.

325
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,259
It's under the blood.

326
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,819
Aren't you thankful for that?

327
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,699
Hebrews chapter 10, notice what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 10, and if we could

328
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:20,519
take time this morning to develop the entirety of Hebrews 9 and 10 together, and looking

329
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,819
at the truth of what Christ did on the cross of Calvary, and the truth in chapter 10 of

330
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:30,259
the contrast between the law having a shadow of good things to come, but remember with

331
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:36,779
the law and the sacrifices, there was a remembrance day after day, year after year of sin.

332
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:41,899
But Jesus, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever, the Bible tells us, on verse

333
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:44,899
number 12, he sat down on the right hand of God.

334
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:51,419
Look down at verse 17, it says, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

335
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,739
Will I remember no more.

336
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:58,739
Listen, if you're saved this morning, your sin, past, present, and future, has been paid

337
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:02,059
for.

338
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,819
Wonderful truth of God's word.

339
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,619
Does it mean that you'll never sin?

340
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:09,019
Oh, if you're saved, you know that's not true.

341
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,739
If you're saved this morning, you know that the flesh was not eradicated at the moment

342
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:18,179
that you got saved, and we have the responsibility of put off the old and put on the new, walk

343
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,219
in the spirit so that you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and we find that there's

344
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,059
this great battle that takes place.

345
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:29,859
But here's the truth, is that we have been saved, the penalty of sin has been paid for,

346
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:35,059
and we find that the power of sin, we've been delivered from the power of sin, but we still

347
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,059
sin.

348
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,059
So what happens when we sin?

349
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,219
Well, our fellowship with God is hindered.

350
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:43,859
I don't lose my salvation when I sin, but when I sin and when you sin, your fellowship

351
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,299
with God is hindered.

352
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,499
He says this, if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

353
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,499
D.L.

354
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:59,619
Moody famously said, this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you from this book.

355
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:04,119
Our fellowship with God is hindered, but we have the great promise in 1 John 1 and verse

356
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,939
number 9, if we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from

357
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:16,500
all unrighteousness, and that's that daily process of having that cleansing that Christ

358
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
offers.

359
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:22,539
He says, I'm not going to pay for my sin, but I don't want my fellowship with God to

360
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:23,539
be hindered.

361
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,739
And so he offers us that daily forgiveness, that opportunity to go and to confess, to

362
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:35,699
say the same thing about the sin and to see his hand of mercy and grace and giving to

363
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,979
us that restored fellowship.

364
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,419
Do you remember David when he sinned?

365
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:44,139
He tried to cover it for a long time, didn't he?

366
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:50,339
And Nathan stands before him and he says, thou art the man.

367
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,819
And David confesses, if you read in the Psalms and you read Psalm 51, the great confession

368
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:59,139
Psalm of David against thee and thee only, have I sinned and done this wickedness in

369
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:00,139
thy sight?

370
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:07,899
He says this, remember and keep in context, understand, restore unto me the joy of thy

371
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,819
salvation.

372
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:15,459
He didn't lose salvation, but he lost the joy of his salvation.

373
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,659
Sin will rob you of your joy of salvation.

374
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,939
For a believer, for someone who knows the Lord Jesus Christ, their personal Savior,

375
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:24,059
the Holy Spirit of God begins to work in your heart.

376
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,139
By the way, conviction's a good thing.

377
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,539
It's good when God convicts us.

378
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,619
It's good when he steps on our toes, but we better respond to the conviction.

379
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,939
But we understand this morning when we talk about the reason for this judgment, it's not

380
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:37,939
what it is not.

381
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:41,059
It's not a judgment that's a judicial hearing for my sin.

382
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,059
What is it then?

383
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:47,699
Well, if I could liken it more to an award ceremony, if I could use that analogy, we

384
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:52,779
understand that the people in Corinth would understand with the games, the Isthmian games

385
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:57,299
that they would be familiar with, they'd understand how that awards would be given out and they'd

386
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,839
have this bima seat, and that's the Greek word that's used to define the judgment seat

387
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,779
of Christ, and it would be this elevated place of where someone would stand and they would

388
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,779
give out rewards or awards for the particular games.

389
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:15,859
And we find here that as we look at the text of Scripture and we understand what it is,

390
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:20,380
we find that here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, if we look at the text, it says

391
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,100
that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he hath done, whether

392
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,239
it be good or bad.

393
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:32,179
In the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3, and I asked you to keep your hand there, but in

394
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,179
1 Corinthians chapter 3, the good things that are mentioned in one word in 2 Corinthians

395
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:43,660
5 and verse 10 are described this way in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 12.

396
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,279
Notice in verse 12, now if any man built upon this foundation, by the way, the foundation

397
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,059
is Jesus Christ, we see in verse number 11, what are the materials?

398
00:24:53,059 --> 00:25:01,179
Well, gold, silver, precious stones, gold, silver, precious stones.

399
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,039
That is the way in which that which is good in verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians 5 is described

400
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,919
here in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 12.

401
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,220
He says whether good or bad.

402
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,500
The word bad really means, the simple definition of it means worthless, worthless.

403
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,539
It's interesting because we find that here in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 12, he

404
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:31,380
uses these three words in the way of helping us to understand that which is worthless or

405
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,619
that which is bad as wood, hay, and stubble.

406
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,839
Have you ever done anything that just is worthless?

407
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,259
I mean, honestly.

408
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:47,179
In fact, I guarantee you that we know some things that are just worthless.

409
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,579
You know some fact about something that really doesn't matter at all.

410
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,139
Who won the MVP award in whatever year in whatever sport?

411
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:56,139
It's worthless information.

412
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,940
You say, no, man, I won a Snickers bar knowing that.

413
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,660
I mean, it's worthless.

414
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,739
In the big scheme of things, you understand what I'm saying.

415
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:14,259
So when we begin to think about what this judgment is, what is the reason for this judgment,

416
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:15,299
God has given to us.

417
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:24,500
If you're saved this morning, if you've been born again this morning, you have been delivered

418
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,579
from the penalty of sin, you've been saved, you're going to heaven.

419
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:39,220
And the God of the universe has given to you a ministry, an opportunity to serve Him.

420
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,660
He's given to you spiritual gifts.

421
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,139
The Bible teaches us, in fact, the church in Corinth receives the information that to

422
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:53,859
everyone, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost has given to every man severally as He will.

423
00:26:53,859 --> 00:27:00,899
As every man hath received the gift, 1 Peter 4, even so let him minister as of the ability

424
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:02,539
that God giveth.

425
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,579
For what purpose?

426
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:08,299
That God would be glorified, that the church would be edified.

427
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:13,100
And so God has given to you and to me, those that are saved here this morning, yes, He's

428
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,419
delivered us from eternal damnation and He's delivered us from the penalty of sin and hallelujah,

429
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:19,940
we can rejoice in that.

430
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,579
But He's given us an opportunity to be His representatives.

431
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:29,220
If we could use the terminology that we find in Ephesians 2 and verses 8 and 9, the Bible

432
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,299
says, for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.

433
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:35,720
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

434
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,820
Verse number 10, we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

435
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
For what purpose?

436
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,220
To do good works that we might glorify our Father.

437
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:52,500
And we find this morning that God has given to each of His children opportunity.

438
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
And what are we doing with it?

439
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,859
What are we doing with our lives that God's given to us?

440
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:05,100
Do we have days that if we were to be honest and evaluate the days or the activities of

441
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,779
the day, say, that was worthless?

442
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:11,059
It was worthless.

443
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,459
I said it from this pulpit a long time ago and I'll say it again this morning.

444
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,660
I made the decision with my children.

445
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,059
I was more concerned about, and I'll use Joseph because he's the only one here, I was more

446
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:24,699
concerned about Joseph walking with God and knowing God than I was with him hitting home

447
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:28,100
runs or slamming a basketball.

448
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,220
Because can I tell you what?

449
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,179
That's temporary, amen?

450
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,779
But walking with God, that's eternal.

451
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,219
Oh, did he play sports?

452
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,219
Sure.

453
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,219
I'm thankful that he could.

454
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,460
But that was never the focus.

455
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,619
That was never the priority.

456
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:55,580
This morning, we find what it is that we stand before Him.

457
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,659
What have I done with what He's given to me?

458
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,460
What have I done to bring honor and glory to His name?

459
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,260
What have I done to reach people with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ?

460
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,260
What have I done with all that He's given to me?

461
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,179
Have I been a good steward?

462
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,700
Paul talks about being a good steward of the manifold grace of God.

463
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,020
Oh, have I been a good steward?

464
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,580
God has given us so many opportunities.

465
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,820
Dean sat up here this morning and he prayed as we prayed to start the service in the Sunday

466
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,619
school lesson this morning from Brother Jeff on Jephthah.

467
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,059
And Dean made the statement, it's so much easier for us to serve God today than it was

468
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:36,339
in his day.

469
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,779
And yet so often we fail.

470
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:45,380
Oh, God's given us many opportunities, freedoms and privileges.

471
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,219
How is it that the church abroad, I'm speaking of the church in Iran, I'm speaking of the

472
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:55,859
church in North Korea, the church in Egypt and places in which the persecution is the

473
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,659
greatest, how's the church thriving?

474
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:00,619
How are they reaching people?

475
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:06,899
We read missionary stories and accounts of our missionaries in China and they have church

476
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,419
and man they got people coming and they have people getting saved and they have people

477
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,499
going out and telling others about Jesus for which they could be incarcerated or worse.

478
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:22,999
But they have a zeal, they have a passion, they want to be used of God, they recognize

479
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:28,119
God's given them an opportunity and they want to please their Savior, they understand they're

480
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,939
going to stand before Him one day.

481
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:37,799
The work and the motive we find in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3 it says this of what sort

482
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:44,859
it is at the end of verse number 13, the work and the motive will be tried by fire.

483
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:49,899
You know we can do a work and not have the right motive.

484
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:52,359
You can do a work and not have the right motive.

485
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,359
What is our motivation?

486
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,999
Well it's the love of Christ constraineth us, in fact it's the next text, verse 14

487
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:01,159
of 2 Corinthians 5.

488
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,739
If our motives are pure, the work is God honoring.

489
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:11,479
Remember as we looked at the churches in the book of Revelation, in every instance God

490
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:14,879
says I know thy works.

491
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,719
I know thy works.

492
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,359
He knows what we're doing, He knows why we're doing it.

493
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,239
This morning we find that the work and the motive will be tried by fire.

494
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,239
What is that fire?

495
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,919
Well I believe it's the Word of God.

496
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,359
In Jeremiah chapter 23 and verse number 29 the Bible tells us in Jeremiah of course a

497
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:38,519
great prophet of God and we find that he had spoken about the truth and he had been rejected

498
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,679
and of course the eve of Babylonian captivity and all that's taking place and in Jeremiah

499
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,719
in chapter 23 God is speaking there and He says in verse 28 the prophet that hath a dream

500
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:53,239
let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully.

501
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,599
What is the chaff to the wheat saith the Lord?

502
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:04,839
And then verse 29 is not my word like as a fire saith the Lord and like a hammer that

503
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,359
breaketh the rocks in pieces.

504
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:14,599
We find that God's Word, how thankful we are for God's Word but it's like a fire and what's

505
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,879
that fire going to do?

506
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:21,799
We notice again in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3 that we begin to understand where the Bible

507
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:29,359
says in verse number 12 about the building, the materials, gold, silver, precious stones,

508
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:36,479
wood, hay, stubble and then verse 13, every man's work shall be made manifest, open, made

509
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:39,119
known, revealed.

510
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:49,759
And it says this, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and

511
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,519
the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

512
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,419
If a man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, so why would it abide?

513
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:02,839
Because it's gold, silver and precious stones.

514
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,799
It's good as it's described in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 10.

515
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,919
And what does the Bible say?

516
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,839
He shall receive a reward.

517
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,539
It's interesting in chapter 5 and verse 10 it says every man may receive and here in

518
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:20,319
verse number 14 it says that he shall receive a reward.

519
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,399
And then we find this truth in verse number 15, if any man's work shall be burned.

520
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,399
Why would it be burned?

521
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:34,039
Well because it's wood, hay and stubble, worthless, bad.

522
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:40,039
And he says this, notice what it says, he shall suffer loss.

523
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:44,839
But he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire.

524
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,919
This idea of he shall suffer loss, it's not losing your salvation, that's secure.

525
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,759
We've spoken about that, we understand the Bible clearly teaches that salvation, eternal

526
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,119
life, the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

527
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,719
It's not probationary life, it's not temporary life, it is eternal life and he's offered

528
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:04,759
it freely.

529
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:11,559
It's not by your works or my works, I can't work to get it, I can't work to keep it.

530
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:19,359
So I'm not going to lose my salvation but the loss is having done nothing worthwhile

531
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,959
for my Lord and Savior.

532
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:26,039
Standing at a judgment seat of Christ who knows all things.

533
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,399
Listen, you're not going to hide anything from him.

534
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:40,159
Tonight the church of the Laodiceans, thus saith the amen, what he says is so.

535
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,359
You can say all that you want to say, the church of the Laodiceans tried that by the

536
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,359
way.

537
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:49,419
Oh we're this, we're that, we'll look at it tonight.

538
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:56,359
But understand with me that on that day I don't want to have wood, hay and stubble.

539
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,519
I don't want to be there if I can in my mind's eye and the way I can illustrate it just be

540
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,719
empty handed to suffer loss.

541
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,679
I've not received a reward but I've suffered loss.

542
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:17,199
See this morning we begin to understand that Christ is going to have, as we would stand

543
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,879
before him, he's going to have perfect judgment and we will understand that our works will

544
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,359
be tried by fire.

545
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,799
Hebrews 6 and verse number 10 says, for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and

546
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:32,639
labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the

547
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,919
saints and do minister.

548
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:40,079
He knows and he keeps good records.

549
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,959
He keeps good records.

550
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:51,439
The reality this morning is that these rewards that we'll receive are not for us to keep

551
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,119
and boast about.

552
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:00,039
The rewards that we receive are not so that for all of eternity we can say, hey look at

553
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,999
my trophy case.

554
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:06,879
See sometimes that's how we live here on earth, is it not?

555
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:13,079
I remember seeing a bumper sticker years ago, he who dies with the most toys wins.

556
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:21,519
I don't even know where that, like what kind of philosophy is that in life?

557
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:28,839
The reality is that those rewards, those crowns are not for my trophy case, they're not for

558
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:29,839
your trophy case.

559
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,559
They're to be cast down at the feet of our Savior.

560
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,559
Why?

561
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,839
Because without him I can do nothing.

562
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,359
Without him I can do nothing.

563
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:46,079
The reality is that I must abide in him and we understand that he will use us for his

564
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,319
honor and for his glory.

565
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,039
He is the one that has saved us.

566
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,959
He is the one that has equipped us.

567
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:56,119
He is the one who enables us and all the good that we do is not because of me, it's because

568
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,479
of Christ in me, the hope of glory.

569
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:06,239
And there'll be no boasting on that day.

570
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,759
Look at what I receive.

571
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,759
No.

572
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:13,359
The only boasting that will take place is, look at how God used us.

573
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,399
Look at what God did.

574
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:20,959
I love it when God works in such a way that only God can get the glory.

575
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:27,839
Oh, so many accounts in his precious word with regard to God working miraculous ways

576
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,399
where no human being could take the credit or the glory.

577
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:36,679
But all must recognize that God did it.

578
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:43,559
This morning, any good in you, any good in me is all because of the good hand of God.

579
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:52,439
As we yield ourselves, as we allow God to work through us, that we understand the reason

580
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,959
for this judgment.

581
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:59,319
So then I ask this question in conclusion this morning, what's our response?

582
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,079
We speak about the reality of the judgment.

583
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,319
We speak about the reason for the judgment, what it is not and what it is.

584
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,799
And then we begin to consider, what's my response this morning?

585
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:14,159
To this truth from 2 Corinthians 5 and verses 10 through 13 and this truth that was given

586
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,559
in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, how do I respond knowing the reality and the reason should

587
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,559
have an impact on every believer?

588
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,279
I said it by way of introduction this morning, that as I read these chapters, as I read these

589
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:32,639
verses, I wonder this morning how the people in Corinth responded.

590
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,500
I wonder this morning when they read these verses, when they read the truth that was

591
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,719
given to them, did it impact them?

592
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,519
Did they believe it to be so?

593
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:48,239
Did they believe that they would indeed stand before their Savior?

594
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,000
How did it alter their behavior?

595
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
What changed in their lives as a result of this truth that we must all appear before

596
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,199
the judgment seat of Christ?

597
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,639
What changed?

598
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,919
How did it impact them?

599
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:05,679
We see specifically how Paul will speak about the impact in his life and I believe that

600
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:11,479
for every one of us, including those in Corinth, that it should lead to evaluation, examination

601
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:15,119
of our lives.

602
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,519
That thing that I just did, that activity that I just participated in, that entertainment,

603
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,440
that fill-in-the-blank, whatever it is that I just did, the words that I said, so on and

604
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,119
so forth, the book that I read, whatever it might be, is it good or bad?

605
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,799
Is it worthwhile or is it worthless?

606
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:40,000
Is God pleased with that decision?

607
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,079
I remember as a young kid seeing, and I don't remember exactly the way that the quote goes,

608
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:49,599
some of you might know it and you could probably help me out with it, but talking about good,

609
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,959
better, and best.

610
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:56,000
And the reality is that we should strive for excellence.

611
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Why?

612
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,519
Because we have an excellent Savior.

613
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,519
And He deserves our very best.

614
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,519
Do you remember when Solomon was going to build the temple?

615
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,519
I mean, it was in David's heart to build it.

616
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,519
It was for God.

617
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,519
He wanted to make it magnificent.

618
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,519
Why?

619
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,519
Because it's for God.

620
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,519
We look at the book of Malachi,

621
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,519
and there's an indictment upon the people of Israel.

622
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,519
Why?

623
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,519
Because they're not bringing their best to God,

624
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,519
they're bringing their worst to God.

625
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,519
If I have time, the extras, the leftovers.

626
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,519
If I can fit it in my schedule.

627
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,519
No, God says, I want your best.

628
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,519
I gave my best for you.

629
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,519
You gave your best for me.

630
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,519
By the way, doesn't He deserve our best?

631
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,519
He deserves our best.

632
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,519
What?

633
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,519
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,

634
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,519
which is in you, which you have of God?

635
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,519
And that you're not your own, for you're bought with a price.

636
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,519
Therefore, glorify God in your body and your soul,

637
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,519
which is His.

638
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,519
He's a good Savior.

639
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,519
He loves us.

640
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,519
He enables us.

641
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,519
And how do we respond?

642
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,519
Well, it's evaluation, it's examination.

643
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,519
I believe that the truth of verse number nine

644
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,519
fits into what we're dealing with this morning,

645
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,519
that we'd be pleasing, well-pleasing to our Lord,

646
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,519
that we would be accepted of Him,

647
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,519
that He would be pleased with us.

648
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,519
Notice, back in 2 Corinthians chapter 5,

649
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,519
as we walk through the next few verses,

650
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,519
notice what Paul says after he talks about this truth,

651
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:28,519
this reality that we shall, we must all appear

652
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,519
before the judgment seat of Christ.

653
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,519
Notice the response in verse number 11.

654
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,519
He says,

655
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,519
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord.

656
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,519
You know the Bible says in the book of Hebrews

657
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:41,519
it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

658
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,519
Our God, here's what the Bible says,

659
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,519
is a consuming fire.

660
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,519
That's what the Bible says.

661
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,519
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord.

662
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,519
What does he say?

663
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,519
How does it motivate him?

664
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,519
Well, he says, we persuade men.

665
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,519
I believe this is an introductory thought

666
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,519
that we'll finish up as we end the fifth chapter

667
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,519
where he talks about having this ministry of reconciliation

668
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,519
and sharing the gospel.

669
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,519
And we see the truth that's given there,

670
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,519
but I recognize this morning that the reality is that,

671
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,519
he says, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,

672
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,519
we persuade men.

673
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,519
Why am I motivated to go and tell people about Jesus?

674
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:25,519
Well, number one, I know that if they die without Christ,

675
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,519
they're gonna go to a lake of fire.

676
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,519
Number two, I understand that Christ has given me

677
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,519
the responsibility, yea, the privilege,

678
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,519
to be his spokesperson.

679
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,519
He's entrusted us with that responsibility,

680
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,519
that privilege.

681
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,519
Paul says it this way in 1 Thessalonians 1, 2,

682
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,519
excuse me, we've been allowed of God.

683
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,519
What a joy.

684
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,519
He says in verse number 11, notice,

685
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,519
but we are made manifest, what does he say?

686
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,519
Unto God.

687
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:57,519
Unto God.

688
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,519
Why does he say we're made manifest unto God?

689
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,519
Well, because he's the one that I'm gonna stand before.

690
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,519
He's the one I'm gonna stand before.

691
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,519
In all transparency, I'm not gonna stand before you one day

692
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,519
and give an account.

693
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,519
You're not gonna stand before me

694
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,519
and give an account in that sense.

695
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,519
But we must all appear before God.

696
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:25,519
If you try to please man, you'll succeed some of the time.

697
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,519
But in the moments where you succeed some of the time,

698
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,519
you'll disappoint others at the same time.

699
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,519
We ought to please God.

700
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:35,519
I preached a message, I mentioned it a few weeks ago.

701
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,519
I preached a message a couple of years ago

702
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,519
for the audience of one.

703
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,519
For the audience of one.

704
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,519
I'm living to please God.

705
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,519
He says that we are made manifest unto God,

706
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,519
and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences,

707
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,519
but first and primary is that we're made manifest unto God.

708
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,519
Notice in verse number 12, he says,

709
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,519
for we commend not ourselves again unto you,

710
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,519
but give you occasion to glory on our behalf.

711
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,519
Notice this, that ye may have somewhat to answer them

712
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,519
which glory, notice where he says,

713
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:07,519
which glory in appearance and not in heart.

714
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,519
Begin to look at verse 12 and think about the truth

715
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,519
and the contrast between the internal and the external,

716
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,519
the motives that are spoken of in 1 Corinthians 3

717
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:20,519
and verse number 13 of what sort it is.

718
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,519
Remember when Samuel is going to anoint

719
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:23,519
the next king of Israel,

720
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:25,519
and he sees Eliab stand before him,

721
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,519
and he sees him, and he's like,

722
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,519
this must be the one.

723
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,519
God says no.

724
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,519
Don't look at the outward.

725
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,519
And then he gives us this wonderful truth

726
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,519
that God sees the heart.

727
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,519
God sees the heart.

728
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,519
Now, the reality, and Brother Jeff mentioned this

729
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:44,519
in Sunday School this morning as well,

730
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,519
the reality is that what's on the inside is going to come out.

731
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,519
What's on the inside is going to come out.

732
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,519
It's going to be evidenced.

733
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,519
We sing the song of the things I used to do.

734
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,519
I don't do them anymore.

735
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:56,519
Why?

736
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:57,519
Because there's been a great change

737
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,519
since I've been morning in.

738
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:00,519
In a few verses of Scripture, the Bible says,

739
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:01,519
I am a new creature.

740
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,519
It says that we've been transformed.

741
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,519
What a joy.

742
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,519
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

743
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:09,519
Old things are passed away.

744
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,519
Behold, all things are become new.

745
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:13,519
Paul says in verse number 13,

746
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,519
for whether we be beside ourselves, notice this,

747
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,519
it is to God.

748
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,519
Or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.

749
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,519
That phrase, whether we be beside ourselves,

750
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,519
kind of interesting with regard to some of them

751
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,519
having some thoughts and opinions about Paul.

752
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:31,519
And Paul says, it's to God

753
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,519
because I'm going to answer to God.

754
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,519
You can think what you want.

755
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,519
You're entitled to have your opinions.

756
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,519
But I'm going to stand before the amen.

757
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,519
And so are you.

758
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,519
And so often what happens when we think about the truth,

759
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,519
and so many people today, it's such a common thing.

760
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,519
Judge not.

761
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,519
You hear people say it, right?

762
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:52,519
Judge not.

763
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,519
Actually, the Bible teaches us to judge,

764
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,519
to judge all things.

765
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,519
We're judged with righteous judgment.

766
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,519
We're to judge according to the word of God.

767
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,519
But you know who you should judge first?

768
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,519
Yourself.

769
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,519
Before you ever go trying to judge somebody else,

770
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,519
you ought to judge yourself.

771
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:13,519
Mote and beam, you remember the account?

772
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:14,519
Do you remember?

773
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,519
I don't need to turn there.

774
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,519
We're out of time.

775
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:17,519
Amen.

776
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:18,519
You remember the account?

777
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:19,519
Hey, listen.

778
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,519
You got a little tiny speck,

779
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,519
and you're trying to criticize someone

780
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,519
and trying to, while you got a beam,

781
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,519
a big old pole in your eye.

782
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:31,519
Right?

783
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,519
That's what he teaches.

784
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,519
And think about this, 1 Samuel 17,

785
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,519
a familiar passage of Scripture,

786
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,519
David fighting Goliath.

787
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:39,519
It's amazing.

788
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,519
I mean, I'm going to run out of time this morning,

789
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,519
but it's okay.

790
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,519
Here's what happens in 1 Samuel 17 that's awesome.

791
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,519
You know who the only one is

792
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,519
that's going to do something for God?

793
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,519
Who's the only one?

794
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,519
David.

795
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,519
Is there not a cause?

796
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,519
And guess who criticizes him?

797
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,519
Everybody else that's not doing anything.

798
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:00,519
Am I not right?

799
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,519
1 Samuel 17, is that not what happens?

800
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,519
You can't do this.

801
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,519
You're here.

802
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:05,519
You're here.

803
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,519
I know the pride of your heart.

804
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,519
The reality is that David,

805
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,519
he's going to stand before God,

806
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,519
and so are you.

807
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:19,519
Before Saul and Eliab and all the others

808
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:21,519
should be casting judgment at David,

809
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:24,519
they should be examining their own hearts.

810
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,519
And we find here,

811
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,519
he says it's to God.

812
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,519
The rewards that will be received,

813
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,519
their crowns I mentioned earlier,

814
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,519
2 John 8 says that we may receive a full reward.

815
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,519
The motivation in and of itself

816
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,519
is not that we'd receive a crown or a reward,

817
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,519
but we understand the truth of God's Word

818
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,519
that there are rewards, crowns to be received.

819
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,519
He tells it to us in the New Testament.

820
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:49,519
There are many examples.

821
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,519
Paul had confidence when he writes

822
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,519
in 2 Timothy 4 about the day of his departure being at hand,

823
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:55,519
and he says,

824
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:58,519
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

825
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,519
He knew.

826
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:00,519
He had confidence.

827
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:01,519
Why?

828
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:03,519
Because he said that the righteous judge would give it to him,

829
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,519
but not to me also,

830
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:08,519
but also to all of them who love his appearing.

831
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,519
What's going to happen with those crowns?

832
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,519
I alluded to it a few minutes ago,

833
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,519
but look at Revelation 4 this morning.

834
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,519
Revelation chapter number 4.

835
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,519
We get a glimpse into the throne room of heaven,

836
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,519
and in verse number 9 of Revelation 4,

837
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:24,519
the Bible says this,

838
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,519
and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks

839
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,519
to him that sat on the throne,

840
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:31,519
who liveth forever and ever,

841
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:33,519
the 4 and 20 elders fall down before him

842
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,519
that sat on the throne

843
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,519
and worship him that liveth forever and ever.

844
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,519
And what does the Bible say there?

845
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,519
And cast their crowns before the throne,

846
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,519
saying what?

847
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,519
Verse number 11.

848
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,519
Thou art worthy, O Lord,

849
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:51,519
to receive glory and honor and power,

850
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:53,519
for thou hast created all things

851
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,519
and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

852
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:58,519
Can I ask you this morning,

853
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,519
do you want to be at that day

854
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,519
with no crown to cast at the feet of our Lord?

855
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,519
That's a sobering truth.

856
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,519
I want to have crowns to cast at the feet of my Savior.

857
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,519
Don't you?

858
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,519
That suffer loss is that,

859
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:19,519
listen, you're not going to lose your salvation.

860
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,519
There is therefore now no condemnation

861
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:22,519
to them that are in Christ Jesus.

862
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,519
You're not going to lose your salvation,

863
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:25,519
but you're going to suffer loss

864
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:27,519
when others are casting those crowns

865
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,519
you have nothing to offer.

866
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:31,519
Your life was one that would be described

867
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,519
as being worthless from a perspective

868
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:37,519
of what we did for God's glory.

869
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,519
Wow.

870
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,519
Paul says it this way, and I'll finish quickly.

871
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:44,519
You don't need to turn there.

872
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,519
Philippians chapter 3.

873
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:54,519
Paul is speaking about his life,

874
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:56,519
his pedigree, if you will.

875
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:58,519
In Hebrew of the Hebrews.

876
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,519
He says in verse number 7 of Philippians 3,

877
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,519
but what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

878
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:10,519
Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss,

879
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,519
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,

880
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,519
for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,

881
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,519
and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.

882
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,519
You know what that word dung means?

883
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,519
It means that which is worthless or detestable.

884
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:28,519
That's what it means.

885
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,519
He says here's what I count them as.

886
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,519
It's worthless.

887
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:35,519
That I may win Christ and be found in him,

888
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,519
not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,

889
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:41,519
but that which is through the faith of Christ,

890
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,519
the righteousness which is of God, by faith.

891
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,519
Paul says listen, I'm going to stand before Christ and so are you.

892
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,519
Are you ready?

893
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,519
Are you ready for that?

894
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,519
He said I'm not ready.

895
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,519
Get ready.

896
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:01,519
Because you don't know when it's going to take place.

897
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:07,519
I believe the desertion of Christ is probably going to happen right after we die.

898
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,519
There are various thoughts with regard to the timing.

899
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:13,519
It may be at some point during the tribulation,

900
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,519
while we're in heaven, the bride of Christ.

901
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,519
But regardless of the timing, you're going to stand before Christ and so am I.

902
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,519
There's no excuses.

903
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,519
No excused absences.

904
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,519
You'll be there.

905
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,519
And are you ready to give an account?

906
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,519
If you're here this morning and you're not saved,

907
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:33,519
what you need is to be saved.

908
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,519
Can I tell you that God offers to you eternal life,

909
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,519
salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ?

910
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:41,519
He said today is the day of salvation.

911
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,519
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

912
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:48,519
But for every child of God this morning,

913
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,519
one day you're going to stand before Christ and so am I.

914
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:53,519
How does it impact us?

915
00:51:53,519 --> 00:52:00,519
How does it alter our behavior to know that we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ?

916
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:01,519
Let's pray together.

917
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,519
Father, we love you.

918
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,519
Thank you for loving us.

919
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:13,519
God, I thank you this morning that you've revealed to us this truth.

920
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,519
Indeed, a sobering truth.

921
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,519
A fearful truth.

922
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:27,519
But a truth nevertheless.

923
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:34,519
God, I pray that we'd live our lives every day to please honor and glorify you.

924
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:37,519
That we might bring honor and glory to thy name.

925
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:45,519
That we may receive reward and not suffer loss.

926
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:46,519
Use us, Lord.

927
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:51,519
Work in this moment to do what only you can do in the hearts of your people.

928
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,519
If there's one not sure of heaven,

929
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,519
oh, I pray that we'd have an opportunity to take a Bible

930
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,519
and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

931
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,519
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray.

932
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,519
Would you stand with me?

933
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,519
Heads are out, eyes are closed.

934
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,519
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

935
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,519
And as she does, the altar is open.

936
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,519
At the end of each of our services, we have an opportunity for you to respond.

937
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:14,519
If you're not sure of heaven, we'll have someone take a Bible

938
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,519
and show you how you can know for sure heaven is your home.

939
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:24,519
If you're saved, the reality of this judgment should cause us to respond.

940
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:27,519
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
