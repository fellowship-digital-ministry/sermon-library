WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.239
in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 9 and we dealt with this subject matter,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:11.520
striving to please my Savior. I wonder over the last week since we had that message, I wonder

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:18.319
how you did in striving to please your Savior last week and understanding that each day we

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:23.520
have opportunity to live for Christ and what a privilege and what a blessing that is.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.079
And I hope that as you look back at your week last week that you could say with confidence that

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.279
I live to please my Lord. If not, then there's time to get it right, amen, and to have the

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:40.000
confession and forsaking and getting right with the Lord. It's interesting as we look at this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.279
portion of 2 Corinthians chapter 5, it seems like we made real fast progress through the beginning

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:50.159
chapters of the book of 2 Corinthians and then we got into chapter 4 and 5 and we just really

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.000
kind of throttled back and really it's the way that the book is kind of gives us the content,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.040
what have you, and we get into this section and how important it is that we grasp the truth

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.400
that we are given here particularly at what we'll look at this morning but really in the greater

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.040
context of the last couple of chapters. Of course, the Apostle Paul started talking about the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.080
beginning of chapter 4. We have this ministry and what a joy it is to be engaged in the work

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.480
of the Lord and what a joy it is to know that those of us that have been saved by the grace of

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.959
God, we have been given the responsibility and the great privilege to be his ambassadors, his

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.559
representatives, to be his witnesses, and what a joy that we've been given as we'll see in just a

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:40.239
couple of weeks, the ministry of reconciliation and what a joy that is that we can share with

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:45.120
others how they too can know the Lord as their personal Lord and Savior. In the last couple of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.239
weeks we've been here in chapter number 5 and we've noted really the focus of Paul. You end

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.040
chapter 4 and he talks about the importance of having an eternal perspective and immediately

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.879
after mentioning that he begins talking about heaven and what a glorious truth that heaven

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:06.879
is a certain reality. If you're here this morning and you've trusted Christ as your personal Savior,

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.240
it's not by works of righteousness which we have done, it's by the grace of God that we could be

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.679
saved and what a joy and blessing that he took my place on the cross of Calvary. He was buried and

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:23.440
he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave. He offers to every human being the free gift of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.559
eternal life and I'm so thankful that someone shared that message with me and that I put my

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:34.559
faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary and heaven is a reality, it is a certainty.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:40.160
In fact, Paul says it this way, that in verse number 8, we are confident, I say, and willing

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.759
rather to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord. After talking about heaven for

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:51.919
those first eight verses, he turns his attention on the importance of living to please our Lord.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:58.399
He says, wherefore we labor in verse number 9, that whether present or absent we may be accepted

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:06.399
of him, literally the idea of striving, of laboring, of working, exercising as he says in

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:13.440
Acts chapter 24, for what purpose? To be well pleasing to our Lord. It's not so that I can be

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.720
saved, that's already settled at Calvary, it's not so that I can stay saved, I'm eternally secure

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.800
in the hand of my God, it's simply so that I can please my Lord. After speaking about heaven and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.559
the impact in Paul's life of having that goal of pleasing his Lord, he now addresses an event

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:40.880
that is future. We do not know, as you think about here as Paul's writing about this and we see

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.800
his eternal perspective, we know that Paul is speaking about this future event and I believe

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.839
this morning the event that is the focus of our study this morning is impactful when properly

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:58.160
understood. It's important to note that both in the book of 1 Corinthians and again in the book of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.960
2 Corinthians, so the church in Corinth receives these two letters that become part of the canon

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.000
of scripture from all scriptures given by inspiration of God. Paul is the human penman to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.520
write these letters and in both letters this event that we're going to look at this morning

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.079
is addressed in both of them. We find in 1 Corinthians he mentions it again here in 2

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.959
Corinthians he mentions it and I wonder this morning what kind of an impact it had on the

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:31.440
members of the church. I wonder this morning as I think about and I begin to consider the church in

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.040
Corinth, a church that's divided, a church that's carnal, a church that's got all kinds of problems,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.920
but Paul is writing to them. God is interested in them. God wants them to to get things taken

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.920
care of and to get things right and to please the Lord and we find that God uses Paul to mention

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.239
this event in both letters and I wonder how they received it. I wonder this morning did they believe

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:06.160
it to be true. Is everything in the Bible true? Every word of God is pure. Amen. Paul was not just

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.399
making something up to try to use as a motivation. No, he's speaking to them truth and I wonder this

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:17.600
morning did they really believe it? I wonder this morning did the truth of the event that we'll look

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.399
at in just a moment, did it alter their behavior at all? Did it alter their behavior at all?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.079
I wonder if it motivated them in any way. If you're familiar with the text of Scripture,

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:34.000
I've not read any of the verses yet that we'll look at this morning, but the event that we're

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.359
speaking of is the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment seat of Christ. And that second question

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:47.519
that I asked this morning as I consider the church in Corinth, I've asked myself and I'll ask you to

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:53.600
ask yourself this morning as well and that's this, does the truth, the reality of the judgment seat

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:02.480
of Christ, has it altered your behavior at all? Has it had an impact on how you live the life that

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.559
you're living? Has it had an impact? The truth of these verses of Scripture is impactful. Oh yes,

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:17.519
it's a motivator, no doubt. But the reality this morning that I, that you, if you're saved this

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:25.679
morning, you will one day stand before the Lord Jesus Christ. How has it impacted us? How has it

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:31.760
altered my behavior? How has it caused me to ask questions with regard to even considering last

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:41.839
week's message, will this decision please my Lord? Will this decision to do X, Y, or Z please my Lord?

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:49.040
Because I'll stand before Him one day. I'll stand before Him one day. I have never stood in a court

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.799
of law before a judge. I actually hope I never do. But I can only consider just for a moment,

00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:05.600
standing before an earthly judge, the fear that would couple that. I saw, and I don't mean to

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.359
embarrass him, but I saw Fernando as he was holding the mic this morning, his hand was

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:13.040
shaking a little bit. And if you were up here singing for the first time, your hand would shake

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.399
a little bit too. Why? It's intimidating. But standing before an earthly judge, who's a human,

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:33.600
is a scary thought. But standing before the Lord God Almighty, the all-knowing, all-wise God,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.880
the one who has all power, He knows not only what you do, but why you do it.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.040
Wow. It ought to alter our behavior. It ought to impact how we live our lives daily.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.720
Because the reality is that we will stand before God. Notice with me in verse number 10. We'll

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.359
read verses 10 through 13, get into the message this morning. For we must all appear before the

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:06.720
judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.880
hath done, whether it be good or bad, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord. We persuade men,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.079
but we are made manifest unto God. And I trust also are made manifest in your consciences,

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:25.040
for we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:32.080
that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart. For whether

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.000
we be beside ourselves, it is to God, or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. This morning,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.840
the title of the message, very simply, the judgment seat of Christ. Number one, if you're

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.880
taking notes, the reality of the judgment. Note with me the reality of the judgment. Remember the

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.520
book of 2 Corinthians as well as the book of 1 Corinthians is a book that's written to believers.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.400
It's a book that's written to a church in Corinth that is made up of individual believers. And we

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.599
find that these people that Paul is writing to, it's interesting even as he writes to them

00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:08.880
in various aspects of speaking about their conversion. You can go back to the book of Acts

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.080
and you can see where the gospel comes into the city of Corinth and how God used Paul and so on

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.919
and so forth. And you find here that these people had accepted Christ as their personal Savior.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:24.960
And now as Paul is writing and we see the reality of the judgment, the book is written

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:34.960
to believers and he says, for we, Christians, believers, for we, referring to the redeemed,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.039
this morning, if you're saved, you're going to be part of this judgment.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.359
If you've trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you'll be part of this judgment. By the

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:46.640
way, if you're not saved this morning, there's just two categories of people, people that are

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.359
saved and people that are lost. Before August 31st, 1997, I was in the category of being lost. I did

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:59.440
not know for sure with certainty that heaven was my home. But on that glorious day, I understood

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.080
with a reality.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.380
a reality that I'd never comprehended before,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.780
that I was a sinner in need of the only Savior,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.120
and I placed my faith in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.320
And I no longer was dead, I was quickened,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.620
I was made alive spiritually, I was born again.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.060
And now, because of that, I'm saved,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.940
I know that heaven is my home,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.940
but I will be one of those that will stand

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.040
at this judgment seat of Christ.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.580
The lost, however, will stand at a different judgment.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.080
I'm thankful that I won't be at that judgment

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.620
as a subject of the judgment.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.980
The Bible clearly teaches in Revelation chapter 20

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.360
that there's another judgment,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.720
it's called the great white throne judgment.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.860
And the great white throne judgment is for those

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.720
that have never accepted Jesus Christ

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.100
as their personal Savior.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.500
In fact, when you read the end of chapter 20

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.840
of the book of Revelation,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.700
it's one of the most difficult passage of scripture

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.440
to read and to comprehend and understand

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.200
that they will be cast in a lake of fire,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.400
and it's the second death.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.260
That's the result of that judgment.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.840
But I won't be at that judgment as a subject

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.140
because I've been saved.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.080
But I will be at the judgment seat of Christ.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.180
And here this morning, when we understand,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.780
he says we, he's referring to the redeemed.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.420
Notice he uses this word, we must.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.380
We must.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.920
You're not gonna escape it.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.380
The reality of the judgment,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.680
the certainty of the judgment is that we must.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.980
You're not gonna escape it.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.920
You ever been in a situation,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.160
I remember being in school,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.420
and maybe you can think about this in some other context,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.420
but I remember being in school

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.860
and the teacher's gonna ask questions,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.160
and how many say, I hope they don't call on me.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.440
I hope they don't call on me.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.060
I hope they don't call on me.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.200
And maybe you get through class and the teacher,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.080
the professor never called on you,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.500
and you said, man, I avoided that.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.480
I didn't get called on.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.640
No, no, we must.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.140
And then notice the next word, all.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.200
We must all.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.280
Every believer, not a one,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.040
will be excused from this judgment.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.680
Not a one will be excused from this judgment.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.480
And he says, we must all, notice,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.480
appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.260
We find here, notice over in 1 Corinthians, if you will,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.140
and chapter number three,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.540
and as you look in 1 Corinthians three,

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.780
and hold your spot in both of these passages,

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.260
we'll bounce back and forth.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.740
I mentioned by way of introduction

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.620
that Paul writes to the church in Corinth

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.620
in both of the letters speaking about the same event.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.220
And we find in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.060
in verse number 10, notice the Bible says,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.380
according to the grace of God,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.460
which is given unto me as a wise master builder,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.080
I have laid the foundation, another buildeth thereon,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.060
but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.860
For other foundation can no man lay,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.500
than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.580
Now, if any man build upon this foundation,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.020
gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.860
notice verse 13, every man's work shall be made manifest.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.780
Do you see?

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.820
We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.500
as he says in 2 Corinthians five and verse number 10.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.780
And now here in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.860
you read in verse 13,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.220
every man's work shall be made manifest for the day,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.380
speaking of the judgment seat of Christ,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.860
shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.420
and the fire shall try every man's work

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.020
of what sort it is.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.420
Romans 14 and verse 10, you don't need to turn there,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.280
but Romans 14 and verse number 10 says it this way.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.580
It says, for we, at the end of the verse,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.040
shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.000
The reality of this judgment.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.280
We understand this morning that the apostle Paul,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.200
after already sharing in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.880
this truth and these believers having an understanding

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.040
of this, he gets into it here

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.520
in 2 Corinthians chapter five.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.440
Now, I want you to consider just for a moment,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.460
again, the structure and the context

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.680
of what we've been reading.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.360
And he rejoices about the ministry that we have.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.040
And yes, we've been given a ministry.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.520
We looked in chapter three of 2 Corinthians

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.640
and we found the great contrast between the law and grace.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.720
And we understand the glory of the new

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.460
and that it giveth life and all of the blessings.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.840
And then Paul says, man,

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.800
I'm gonna be with my savior forever.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.720
I know, I have confidence.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.640
Mortality will be swallowed up of life.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.520
And he's rejoicing.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.080
And then he says, we're all gonna appear

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.820
before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.480
I think the excitement leads to a level of sobriety.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.680
The excitement, I'm gonna go and be with Jesus forever.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.340
You're gonna stand before Him.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.640
The sobriety of that truth,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.080
the impact this morning of the reality of this judgment,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.200
it ought to shake every believer to their very core.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.680
How often I talk to individuals that say,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.200
well, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.320
And they decide they're gonna live like this

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.240
and skip church and skip this.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.440
And don't read their Bible and don't pray

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.880
and don't give and don't,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.820
and I'm just gonna go to heaven.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.440
Oh, you're gonna suffer loss

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.840
when you stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.440
And we'll get to that in just a moment

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.920
and look at the context.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.480
But I understand as I look last week

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.680
at striving to please my savior,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.940
the reality is that why is Paul laboring?

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.720
Why is Paul exercising?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.360
Why is he striving to please his Lord?

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.320
Because he recognizes with certainty

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.420
that yes, I will stand before Him and give an account.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.760
And it's a scary truth.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.480
The reality is that when we understand this this morning,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.200
I don't think, and I'll ask the question

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.600
at the end of the message this morning,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.420
are you ready for it?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.320
But I don't think any of us can probably really say,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.780
I'm ready to stand before Christ.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.300
But you understand, it will happen.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.340
There are people that speak about dying with no regrets.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.380
And oftentimes they speak in the context

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.100
of having regrets one toward another

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.620
through a human relationship.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.620
But I wonder this morning how often we think

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.060
of not having any regrets on that day

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.820
when we stand before our savior.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.740
Because once we take that final breath here on earth,

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.540
there's no more opportunity to be in that state

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.300
and there's no more opportunity to do the things

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.200
in this body that we're commanded to do.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.360
We have just a little bit of time to please our savior.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.060
The reality of this judgment.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.780
Number two, the reason for the judgment.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.180
The reason for the judgment.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.940
Let me first start by saying what it is not.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.320
What this judgment is not.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.060
This judgment is not a judicial hearing

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.940
and it is not for sin.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.900
And for that I can rejoice.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.660
The truth of the matter this morning

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.820
is that sin was judged on the cross of Calvary

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.060
when the father poured out his wrath upon the son.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.060
And we understand that Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.220
took my place, took your place.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.940
He bore the sin of the world.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.220
And I'm thankful for that this morning.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.740
I'm thankful this morning.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.780
The Bible says in just a few verses here

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.700
at the end of 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.060
for he hath made him to be sin for us

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.500
who knew no sin that we might be made

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.580
the righteousness of God in him.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.580
The truth of the imputed righteousness of Christ.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.980
And I didn't understand all of that on August 31st, 1897

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.940
when I trusted Christ as my savior,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.700
but there was a great transaction that took place.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.300
And Christ's righteousness was imputed upon my account.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.860
And when you got saved, the same thing took place.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.660
And he gives us promises such as this,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.060
that I'll remember no more.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.420
As far as the East is from the West and so on and so forth.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.420
And we begin to understand this morning,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.420
the truth of this judgment and what it is not.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.020
The judgment seat of Christ is not for your sin.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.260
Notice with me, if you will, again,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.060
in verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians chapter five,

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.420
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.700
that everyone may receive the things done in his body

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.980
according to that he hath done,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.980
whether it be good or bad.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.700
We'll get into just a moment what it is,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.260
but when we deal with what it is not,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.980
why do I know that it's not being judged for sin?

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.260
Well, let me share a few verses with you.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.860
Number one, John chapter five.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.580
Notice what the Bible says in John chapter number five

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.820
this morning in verse number 24.

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:57.540
John chapter five and verse number 24,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.380
the Bible says this,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.059
verily, verily, I say unto you,

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:04.739
he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me

00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:07.700
hath everlasting life, notice this,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.660
and shall not come into condemnation,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.540
but is passed from death unto life.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.940
When I got saved, when you got saved, that's what happened.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.420
It says, he that heareth my word and believeth on him

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.179
that sent me hath everlasting life.

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:28.420
And there, the result is that he shall not come

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.540
into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.700
Remember the truth of Romans chapter number eight

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.900
in verse number one, and what a glorious truth it is

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.500
where the Bible tells us of those again,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.780
of us that are saved, it says,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.780
there is therefore now no condemnation to them

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.140
which are in Christ Jesus,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.020
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.940
And I'm thankful that I don't have to give an account

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.179
for my sin, my sin's been taken care of by Christ.

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:01.659
It's been taken care of.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:02.659
It's under the blood.

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:07.259
In fact, we've had the opportunity to sing that song on more than one occasion.

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:08.259
It's under the blood.

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:10.819
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:14.699
Hebrews chapter 10, notice what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 10, and if we could

00:20:14.699 --> 00:20:20.519
take time this morning to develop the entirety of Hebrews 9 and 10 together, and looking

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:25.819
at the truth of what Christ did on the cross of Calvary, and the truth in chapter 10 of

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:30.259
the contrast between the law having a shadow of good things to come, but remember with

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:36.779
the law and the sacrifices, there was a remembrance day after day, year after year of sin.

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:41.899
But Jesus, after he made one sacrifice for sin forever, the Bible tells us, on verse

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:44.899
number 12, he sat down on the right hand of God.

00:20:44.899 --> 00:20:51.419
Look down at verse 17, it says, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:52.739
Will I remember no more.

00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:58.739
Listen, if you're saved this morning, your sin, past, present, and future, has been paid

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:02.059
for.

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:03.819
Wonderful truth of God's word.

00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:05.619
Does it mean that you'll never sin?

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:09.019
Oh, if you're saved, you know that's not true.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.739
If you're saved this morning, you know that the flesh was not eradicated at the moment

00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:18.179
that you got saved, and we have the responsibility of put off the old and put on the new, walk

00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:22.219
in the spirit so that you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and we find that there's

00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:24.059
this great battle that takes place.

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:29.859
But here's the truth, is that we have been saved, the penalty of sin has been paid for,

00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:35.059
and we find that the power of sin, we've been delivered from the power of sin, but we still

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:36.059
sin.

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:37.059
So what happens when we sin?

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.219
Well, our fellowship with God is hindered.

00:21:39.219 --> 00:21:43.859
I don't lose my salvation when I sin, but when I sin and when you sin, your fellowship

00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:48.299
with God is hindered.

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:53.499
He says this, if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:54.499
D.L.

00:21:54.499 --> 00:21:59.619
Moody famously said, this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you from this book.

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:04.119
Our fellowship with God is hindered, but we have the great promise in 1 John 1 and verse

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:09.939
number 9, if we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from

00:22:09.939 --> 00:22:16.500
all unrighteousness, and that's that daily process of having that cleansing that Christ

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500
offers.

00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:22.539
He says, I'm not going to pay for my sin, but I don't want my fellowship with God to

00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:23.539
be hindered.

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:28.739
And so he offers us that daily forgiveness, that opportunity to go and to confess, to

00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:35.699
say the same thing about the sin and to see his hand of mercy and grace and giving to

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:37.979
us that restored fellowship.

00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:40.419
Do you remember David when he sinned?

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:44.139
He tried to cover it for a long time, didn't he?

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:50.339
And Nathan stands before him and he says, thou art the man.

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:54.819
And David confesses, if you read in the Psalms and you read Psalm 51, the great confession

00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:59.139
Psalm of David against thee and thee only, have I sinned and done this wickedness in

00:22:59.139 --> 00:23:00.139
thy sight?

00:23:00.139 --> 00:23:07.899
He says this, remember and keep in context, understand, restore unto me the joy of thy

00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:09.819
salvation.

00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:15.459
He didn't lose salvation, but he lost the joy of his salvation.

00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:17.659
Sin will rob you of your joy of salvation.

00:23:17.659 --> 00:23:21.939
For a believer, for someone who knows the Lord Jesus Christ, their personal Savior,

00:23:21.939 --> 00:23:24.059
the Holy Spirit of God begins to work in your heart.

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:26.139
By the way, conviction's a good thing.

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:27.539
It's good when God convicts us.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:32.619
It's good when he steps on our toes, but we better respond to the conviction.

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:36.939
But we understand this morning when we talk about the reason for this judgment, it's not

00:23:36.939 --> 00:23:37.939
what it is not.

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:41.059
It's not a judgment that's a judicial hearing for my sin.

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:42.059
What is it then?

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:47.699
Well, if I could liken it more to an award ceremony, if I could use that analogy, we

00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:52.779
understand that the people in Corinth would understand with the games, the Isthmian games

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:57.299
that they would be familiar with, they'd understand how that awards would be given out and they'd

00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:01.839
have this bima seat, and that's the Greek word that's used to define the judgment seat

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:06.779
of Christ, and it would be this elevated place of where someone would stand and they would

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:10.779
give out rewards or awards for the particular games.

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:15.859
And we find here that as we look at the text of Scripture and we understand what it is,

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:20.380
we find that here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, if we look at the text, it says

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:26.100
that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he hath done, whether

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.239
it be good or bad.

00:24:28.239 --> 00:24:32.179
In the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3, and I asked you to keep your hand there, but in

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:37.179
1 Corinthians chapter 3, the good things that are mentioned in one word in 2 Corinthians

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:43.660
5 and verse 10 are described this way in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 12.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.279
Notice in verse 12, now if any man built upon this foundation, by the way, the foundation

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:53.059
is Jesus Christ, we see in verse number 11, what are the materials?

00:24:53.059 --> 00:25:01.179
Well, gold, silver, precious stones, gold, silver, precious stones.

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:07.039
That is the way in which that which is good in verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians 5 is described

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:10.919
here in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 12.

00:25:10.919 --> 00:25:14.220
He says whether good or bad.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:21.500
The word bad really means, the simple definition of it means worthless, worthless.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.539
It's interesting because we find that here in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 12, he

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:31.380
uses these three words in the way of helping us to understand that which is worthless or

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.619
that which is bad as wood, hay, and stubble.

00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:40.839
Have you ever done anything that just is worthless?

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.259
I mean, honestly.

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:47.179
In fact, I guarantee you that we know some things that are just worthless.

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:51.579
You know some fact about something that really doesn't matter at all.

00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:55.139
Who won the MVP award in whatever year in whatever sport?

00:25:55.139 --> 00:25:56.139
It's worthless information.

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.940
You say, no, man, I won a Snickers bar knowing that.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.660
I mean, it's worthless.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:07.739
In the big scheme of things, you understand what I'm saying.

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:14.259
So when we begin to think about what this judgment is, what is the reason for this judgment,

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:15.299
God has given to us.

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:24.500
If you're saved this morning, if you've been born again this morning, you have been delivered

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.579
from the penalty of sin, you've been saved, you're going to heaven.

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:39.220
And the God of the universe has given to you a ministry, an opportunity to serve Him.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.660
He's given to you spiritual gifts.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.139
The Bible teaches us, in fact, the church in Corinth receives the information that to

00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:53.859
everyone, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost has given to every man severally as He will.

00:26:53.859 --> 00:27:00.899
As every man hath received the gift, 1 Peter 4, even so let him minister as of the ability

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:02.539
that God giveth.

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:03.579
For what purpose?

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:08.299
That God would be glorified, that the church would be edified.

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:13.100
And so God has given to you and to me, those that are saved here this morning, yes, He's

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.419
delivered us from eternal damnation and He's delivered us from the penalty of sin and hallelujah,

00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:19.940
we can rejoice in that.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.579
But He's given us an opportunity to be His representatives.

00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:29.220
If we could use the terminology that we find in Ephesians 2 and verses 8 and 9, the Bible

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.299
says, for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves.

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:35.720
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.820
Verse number 10, we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.820
For what purpose?

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.220
To do good works that we might glorify our Father.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:52.500
And we find this morning that God has given to each of His children opportunity.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.500
And what are we doing with it?

00:27:53.500 --> 00:28:00.859
What are we doing with our lives that God's given to us?

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:05.100
Do we have days that if we were to be honest and evaluate the days or the activities of

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.779
the day, say, that was worthless?

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:11.059
It was worthless.

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:14.459
I said it from this pulpit a long time ago and I'll say it again this morning.

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:16.660
I made the decision with my children.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.059
I was more concerned about, and I'll use Joseph because he's the only one here, I was more

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:24.699
concerned about Joseph walking with God and knowing God than I was with him hitting home

00:28:24.699 --> 00:28:28.100
runs or slamming a basketball.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.220
Because can I tell you what?

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.179
That's temporary, amen?

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:36.779
But walking with God, that's eternal.

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:39.219
Oh, did he play sports?

00:28:39.219 --> 00:28:40.219
Sure.

00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:42.219
I'm thankful that he could.

00:28:42.299 --> 00:28:44.460
But that was never the focus.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.619
That was never the priority.

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:55.580
This morning, we find what it is that we stand before Him.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.659
What have I done with what He's given to me?

00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:02.460
What have I done to bring honor and glory to His name?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.260
What have I done to reach people with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.260
What have I done with all that He's given to me?

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:13.179
Have I been a good steward?

00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:16.700
Paul talks about being a good steward of the manifold grace of God.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.020
Oh, have I been a good steward?

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.580
God has given us so many opportunities.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.820
Dean sat up here this morning and he prayed as we prayed to start the service in the Sunday

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.619
school lesson this morning from Brother Jeff on Jephthah.

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:35.059
And Dean made the statement, it's so much easier for us to serve God today than it was

00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:36.339
in his day.

00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:38.779
And yet so often we fail.

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:45.380
Oh, God's given us many opportunities, freedoms and privileges.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.219
How is it that the church abroad, I'm speaking of the church in Iran, I'm speaking of the

00:29:50.219 --> 00:29:55.859
church in North Korea, the church in Egypt and places in which the persecution is the

00:29:55.859 --> 00:29:58.659
greatest, how's the church thriving?

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:00.619
How are they reaching people?

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:06.899
We read missionary stories and accounts of our missionaries in China and they have church

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:10.419
and man they got people coming and they have people getting saved and they have people

00:30:10.419 --> 00:30:16.499
going out and telling others about Jesus for which they could be incarcerated or worse.

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:22.999
But they have a zeal, they have a passion, they want to be used of God, they recognize

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:28.119
God's given them an opportunity and they want to please their Savior, they understand they're

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:30.939
going to stand before Him one day.

00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:37.799
The work and the motive we find in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3 it says this of what sort

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:44.859
it is at the end of verse number 13, the work and the motive will be tried by fire.

00:30:44.859 --> 00:30:49.899
You know we can do a work and not have the right motive.

00:30:49.899 --> 00:30:52.359
You can do a work and not have the right motive.

00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:53.359
What is our motivation?

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:57.999
Well it's the love of Christ constraineth us, in fact it's the next text, verse 14

00:30:57.999 --> 00:31:01.159
of 2 Corinthians 5.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:06.739
If our motives are pure, the work is God honoring.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:11.479
Remember as we looked at the churches in the book of Revelation, in every instance God

00:31:11.479 --> 00:31:14.879
says I know thy works.

00:31:14.879 --> 00:31:16.719
I know thy works.

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:20.359
He knows what we're doing, He knows why we're doing it.

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:24.239
This morning we find that the work and the motive will be tried by fire.

00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:25.239
What is that fire?

00:31:25.239 --> 00:31:26.919
Well I believe it's the Word of God.

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:32.359
In Jeremiah chapter 23 and verse number 29 the Bible tells us in Jeremiah of course a

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:38.519
great prophet of God and we find that he had spoken about the truth and he had been rejected

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:43.679
and of course the eve of Babylonian captivity and all that's taking place and in Jeremiah

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:48.719
in chapter 23 God is speaking there and He says in verse 28 the prophet that hath a dream

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:53.239
let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully.

00:31:53.239 --> 00:31:55.599
What is the chaff to the wheat saith the Lord?

00:31:55.599 --> 00:32:04.839
And then verse 29 is not my word like as a fire saith the Lord and like a hammer that

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:08.359
breaketh the rocks in pieces.

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:14.599
We find that God's Word, how thankful we are for God's Word but it's like a fire and what's

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.879
that fire going to do?

00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:21.799
We notice again in 1 Corinthians chapter number 3 that we begin to understand where the Bible

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:29.359
says in verse number 12 about the building, the materials, gold, silver, precious stones,

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:36.479
wood, hay, stubble and then verse 13, every man's work shall be made manifest, open, made

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:39.119
known, revealed.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:49.759
And it says this, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:53.519
the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.419
If a man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, so why would it abide?

00:32:58.419 --> 00:33:02.839
Because it's gold, silver and precious stones.

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:07.799
It's good as it's described in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 10.

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:08.919
And what does the Bible say?

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:11.839
He shall receive a reward.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:16.539
It's interesting in chapter 5 and verse 10 it says every man may receive and here in

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:20.319
verse number 14 it says that he shall receive a reward.

00:33:20.319 --> 00:33:25.399
And then we find this truth in verse number 15, if any man's work shall be burned.

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:26.399
Why would it be burned?

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:34.039
Well because it's wood, hay and stubble, worthless, bad.

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:40.039
And he says this, notice what it says, he shall suffer loss.

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:44.839
But he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire.

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:49.919
This idea of he shall suffer loss, it's not losing your salvation, that's secure.

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:54.759
We've spoken about that, we understand the Bible clearly teaches that salvation, eternal

00:33:54.759 --> 00:33:59.119
life, the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:03.719
It's not probationary life, it's not temporary life, it is eternal life and he's offered

00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:04.759
it freely.

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:11.559
It's not by your works or my works, I can't work to get it, I can't work to keep it.

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:19.359
So I'm not going to lose my salvation but the loss is having done nothing worthwhile

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:22.959
for my Lord and Savior.

00:34:22.959 --> 00:34:26.039
Standing at a judgment seat of Christ who knows all things.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:31.399
Listen, you're not going to hide anything from him.

00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:40.159
Tonight the church of the Laodiceans, thus saith the amen, what he says is so.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.359
You can say all that you want to say, the church of the Laodiceans tried that by the

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.359
way.

00:34:44.359 --> 00:34:49.419
Oh we're this, we're that, we'll look at it tonight.

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:56.359
But understand with me that on that day I don't want to have wood, hay and stubble.

00:34:56.359 --> 00:35:02.519
I don't want to be there if I can in my mind's eye and the way I can illustrate it just be

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:06.719
empty handed to suffer loss.

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:10.679
I've not received a reward but I've suffered loss.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:17.199
See this morning we begin to understand that Christ is going to have, as we would stand

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:21.879
before him, he's going to have perfect judgment and we will understand that our works will

00:35:21.879 --> 00:35:23.359
be tried by fire.

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:27.799
Hebrews 6 and verse number 10 says, for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and

00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:32.639
labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the

00:35:32.639 --> 00:35:34.919
saints and do minister.

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:40.079
He knows and he keeps good records.

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:45.959
He keeps good records.

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:51.439
The reality this morning is that these rewards that we'll receive are not for us to keep

00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:54.119
and boast about.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:36:00.039
The rewards that we receive are not so that for all of eternity we can say, hey look at

00:36:00.039 --> 00:36:02.999
my trophy case.

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:06.879
See sometimes that's how we live here on earth, is it not?

00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:13.079
I remember seeing a bumper sticker years ago, he who dies with the most toys wins.

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:21.519
I don't even know where that, like what kind of philosophy is that in life?

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:28.839
The reality is that those rewards, those crowns are not for my trophy case, they're not for

00:36:28.839 --> 00:36:29.839
your trophy case.

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:33.559
They're to be cast down at the feet of our Savior.

00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:34.559
Why?

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:38.839
Because without him I can do nothing.

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:40.359
Without him I can do nothing.

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:46.079
The reality is that I must abide in him and we understand that he will use us for his

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.319
honor and for his glory.

00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:49.039
He is the one that has saved us.

00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:50.959
He is the one that has equipped us.

00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:56.119
He is the one who enables us and all the good that we do is not because of me, it's because

00:36:56.119 --> 00:37:00.479
of Christ in me, the hope of glory.

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:06.239
And there'll be no boasting on that day.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.759
Look at what I receive.

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:08.759
No.

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:13.359
The only boasting that will take place is, look at how God used us.

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.399
Look at what God did.

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:20.959
I love it when God works in such a way that only God can get the glory.

00:37:20.959 --> 00:37:27.839
Oh, so many accounts in his precious word with regard to God working miraculous ways

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:32.399
where no human being could take the credit or the glory.

00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:36.679
But all must recognize that God did it.

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:43.559
This morning, any good in you, any good in me is all because of the good hand of God.

00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:52.439
As we yield ourselves, as we allow God to work through us, that we understand the reason

00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:53.959
for this judgment.

00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:59.319
So then I ask this question in conclusion this morning, what's our response?

00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:01.079
We speak about the reality of the judgment.

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:05.319
We speak about the reason for the judgment, what it is not and what it is.

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:08.799
And then we begin to consider, what's my response this morning?

00:38:08.799 --> 00:38:14.159
To this truth from 2 Corinthians 5 and verses 10 through 13 and this truth that was given

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:19.559
in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, how do I respond knowing the reality and the reason should

00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:22.559
have an impact on every believer?

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:27.279
I said it by way of introduction this morning, that as I read these chapters, as I read these

00:38:27.279 --> 00:38:32.639
verses, I wonder this morning how the people in Corinth responded.

00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:37.500
I wonder this morning when they read these verses, when they read the truth that was

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.719
given to them, did it impact them?

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:42.519
Did they believe it to be so?

00:38:42.519 --> 00:38:48.239
Did they believe that they would indeed stand before their Savior?

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.000
How did it alter their behavior?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000
What changed in their lives as a result of this truth that we must all appear before

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.199
the judgment seat of Christ?

00:38:58.199 --> 00:38:59.639
What changed?

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:00.919
How did it impact them?

00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:05.679
We see specifically how Paul will speak about the impact in his life and I believe that

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:11.479
for every one of us, including those in Corinth, that it should lead to evaluation, examination

00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:15.119
of our lives.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:20.519
That thing that I just did, that activity that I just participated in, that entertainment,

00:39:20.519 --> 00:39:24.440
that fill-in-the-blank, whatever it is that I just did, the words that I said, so on and

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:31.119
so forth, the book that I read, whatever it might be, is it good or bad?

00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:34.799
Is it worthwhile or is it worthless?

00:39:34.799 --> 00:39:40.000
Is God pleased with that decision?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.079
I remember as a young kid seeing, and I don't remember exactly the way that the quote goes,

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:49.599
some of you might know it and you could probably help me out with it, but talking about good,

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:52.959
better, and best.

00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:56.000
And the reality is that we should strive for excellence.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Why?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.519
Because we have an excellent Savior.

00:39:58.519 --> 00:40:01.519
And He deserves our very best.

00:40:01.519 --> 00:40:04.519
Do you remember when Solomon was going to build the temple?

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:06.519
I mean, it was in David's heart to build it.

00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:07.519
It was for God.

00:40:07.519 --> 00:40:09.519
He wanted to make it magnificent.

00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:10.519
Why?

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:12.519
Because it's for God.

00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:14.519
We look at the book of Malachi,

00:40:14.519 --> 00:40:16.519
and there's an indictment upon the people of Israel.

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:17.519
Why?

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:19.519
Because they're not bringing their best to God,

00:40:19.519 --> 00:40:22.519
they're bringing their worst to God.

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:25.519
If I have time, the extras, the leftovers.

00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:27.519
If I can fit it in my schedule.

00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:29.519
No, God says, I want your best.

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:32.519
I gave my best for you.

00:40:32.519 --> 00:40:34.519
You gave your best for me.

00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:38.519
By the way, doesn't He deserve our best?

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:42.519
He deserves our best.

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:43.519
What?

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:46.519
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,

00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:48.519
which is in you, which you have of God?

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:51.519
And that you're not your own, for you're bought with a price.

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:54.519
Therefore, glorify God in your body and your soul,

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:56.519
which is His.

00:40:56.519 --> 00:40:59.519
He's a good Savior.

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:00.519
He loves us.

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:01.519
He enables us.

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:03.519
And how do we respond?

00:41:03.519 --> 00:41:05.519
Well, it's evaluation, it's examination.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:07.519
I believe that the truth of verse number nine

00:41:07.519 --> 00:41:09.519
fits into what we're dealing with this morning,

00:41:09.519 --> 00:41:12.519
that we'd be pleasing, well-pleasing to our Lord,

00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:13.519
that we would be accepted of Him,

00:41:13.519 --> 00:41:15.519
that He would be pleased with us.

00:41:15.519 --> 00:41:18.519
Notice, back in 2 Corinthians chapter 5,

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:20.519
as we walk through the next few verses,

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:24.519
notice what Paul says after he talks about this truth,

00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:28.519
this reality that we shall, we must all appear

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.519
before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:32.519
Notice the response in verse number 11.

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:33.519
He says,

00:41:33.519 --> 00:41:37.519
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord.

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:38.519
You know the Bible says in the book of Hebrews

00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:41.519
it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:43.519
Our God, here's what the Bible says,

00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:47.519
is a consuming fire.

00:41:47.519 --> 00:41:52.519
That's what the Bible says.

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:55.519
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord.

00:41:55.519 --> 00:41:56.519
What does he say?

00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:57.519
How does it motivate him?

00:41:57.519 --> 00:42:00.519
Well, he says, we persuade men.

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.519
I believe this is an introductory thought

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:06.519
that we'll finish up as we end the fifth chapter

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:09.519
where he talks about having this ministry of reconciliation

00:42:09.519 --> 00:42:12.519
and sharing the gospel.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:14.519
And we see the truth that's given there,

00:42:14.519 --> 00:42:17.519
but I recognize this morning that the reality is that,

00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:18.519
he says, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,

00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.519
we persuade men.

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:22.519
Why am I motivated to go and tell people about Jesus?

00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:25.519
Well, number one, I know that if they die without Christ,

00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:27.519
they're gonna go to a lake of fire.

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:29.519
Number two, I understand that Christ has given me

00:42:29.519 --> 00:42:32.519
the responsibility, yea, the privilege,

00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:34.519
to be his spokesperson.

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:37.519
He's entrusted us with that responsibility,

00:42:37.519 --> 00:42:38.519
that privilege.

00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:41.519
Paul says it this way in 1 Thessalonians 1, 2,

00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:45.519
excuse me, we've been allowed of God.

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:47.519
What a joy.

00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:51.519
He says in verse number 11, notice,

00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:54.519
but we are made manifest, what does he say?

00:42:54.519 --> 00:42:56.519
Unto God.

00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:57.519
Unto God.

00:42:57.519 --> 00:42:59.519
Why does he say we're made manifest unto God?

00:42:59.519 --> 00:43:02.519
Well, because he's the one that I'm gonna stand before.

00:43:02.519 --> 00:43:04.519
He's the one I'm gonna stand before.

00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:09.519
In all transparency, I'm not gonna stand before you one day

00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:10.519
and give an account.

00:43:10.519 --> 00:43:11.519
You're not gonna stand before me

00:43:11.519 --> 00:43:14.519
and give an account in that sense.

00:43:14.519 --> 00:43:16.519
But we must all appear before God.

00:43:16.519 --> 00:43:25.519
If you try to please man, you'll succeed some of the time.

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:27.519
But in the moments where you succeed some of the time,

00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:30.519
you'll disappoint others at the same time.

00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:32.519
We ought to please God.

00:43:32.519 --> 00:43:35.519
I preached a message, I mentioned it a few weeks ago.

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:37.519
I preached a message a couple of years ago

00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:39.519
for the audience of one.

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:41.519
For the audience of one.

00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:42.519
I'm living to please God.

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:44.519
He says that we are made manifest unto God,

00:43:44.519 --> 00:43:47.519
and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences,

00:43:47.519 --> 00:43:50.519
but first and primary is that we're made manifest unto God.

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:52.519
Notice in verse number 12, he says,

00:43:52.519 --> 00:43:54.519
for we commend not ourselves again unto you,

00:43:54.519 --> 00:43:57.519
but give you occasion to glory on our behalf.

00:43:57.519 --> 00:44:00.519
Notice this, that ye may have somewhat to answer them

00:44:00.519 --> 00:44:02.519
which glory, notice where he says,

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:07.519
which glory in appearance and not in heart.

00:44:07.519 --> 00:44:10.519
Begin to look at verse 12 and think about the truth

00:44:10.519 --> 00:44:12.519
and the contrast between the internal and the external,

00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:16.519
the motives that are spoken of in 1 Corinthians 3

00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:20.519
and verse number 13 of what sort it is.

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:22.519
Remember when Samuel is going to anoint

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:23.519
the next king of Israel,

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:25.519
and he sees Eliab stand before him,

00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:26.519
and he sees him, and he's like,

00:44:26.519 --> 00:44:29.519
this must be the one.

00:44:29.519 --> 00:44:31.519
God says no.

00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:33.519
Don't look at the outward.

00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:36.519
And then he gives us this wonderful truth

00:44:36.519 --> 00:44:39.519
that God sees the heart.

00:44:39.519 --> 00:44:41.519
God sees the heart.

00:44:41.519 --> 00:44:43.519
Now, the reality, and Brother Jeff mentioned this

00:44:43.519 --> 00:44:44.519
in Sunday School this morning as well,

00:44:44.519 --> 00:44:48.519
the reality is that what's on the inside is going to come out.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.519
What's on the inside is going to come out.

00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:53.519
It's going to be evidenced.

00:44:53.519 --> 00:44:54.519
We sing the song of the things I used to do.

00:44:54.519 --> 00:44:55.519
I don't do them anymore.

00:44:55.519 --> 00:44:56.519
Why?

00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:57.519
Because there's been a great change

00:44:57.519 --> 00:44:58.519
since I've been morning in.

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:00.519
In a few verses of Scripture, the Bible says,

00:45:00.519 --> 00:45:01.519
I am a new creature.

00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:04.519
It says that we've been transformed.

00:45:04.519 --> 00:45:06.519
What a joy.

00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:08.519
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:09.519
Old things are passed away.

00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:12.519
Behold, all things are become new.

00:45:12.519 --> 00:45:13.519
Paul says in verse number 13,

00:45:13.519 --> 00:45:16.519
for whether we be beside ourselves, notice this,

00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:18.519
it is to God.

00:45:18.519 --> 00:45:20.519
Or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.

00:45:20.519 --> 00:45:22.519
That phrase, whether we be beside ourselves,

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.519
kind of interesting with regard to some of them

00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:28.519
having some thoughts and opinions about Paul.

00:45:28.519 --> 00:45:31.519
And Paul says, it's to God

00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:33.519
because I'm going to answer to God.

00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:35.519
You can think what you want.

00:45:35.519 --> 00:45:37.519
You're entitled to have your opinions.

00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:41.519
But I'm going to stand before the amen.

00:45:41.519 --> 00:45:43.519
And so are you.

00:45:43.519 --> 00:45:46.519
And so often what happens when we think about the truth,

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.519
and so many people today, it's such a common thing.

00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:49.519
Judge not.

00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:51.519
You hear people say it, right?

00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:52.519
Judge not.

00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:54.519
Actually, the Bible teaches us to judge,

00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:56.519
to judge all things.

00:45:56.519 --> 00:45:58.519
We're judged with righteous judgment.

00:45:58.519 --> 00:46:02.519
We're to judge according to the word of God.

00:46:02.519 --> 00:46:04.519
But you know who you should judge first?

00:46:04.519 --> 00:46:06.519
Yourself.

00:46:06.519 --> 00:46:08.519
Before you ever go trying to judge somebody else,

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:10.519
you ought to judge yourself.

00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:13.519
Mote and beam, you remember the account?

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:14.519
Do you remember?

00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:15.519
I don't need to turn there.

00:46:15.519 --> 00:46:16.519
We're out of time.

00:46:16.519 --> 00:46:17.519
Amen.

00:46:17.519 --> 00:46:18.519
You remember the account?

00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:19.519
Hey, listen.

00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:23.519
You got a little tiny speck,

00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:25.519
and you're trying to criticize someone

00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:27.519
and trying to, while you got a beam,

00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:30.519
a big old pole in your eye.

00:46:30.519 --> 00:46:31.519
Right?

00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:33.519
That's what he teaches.

00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:35.519
And think about this, 1 Samuel 17,

00:46:35.519 --> 00:46:36.519
a familiar passage of Scripture,

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:38.519
David fighting Goliath.

00:46:38.519 --> 00:46:39.519
It's amazing.

00:46:39.519 --> 00:46:41.519
I mean, I'm going to run out of time this morning,

00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:42.519
but it's okay.

00:46:42.519 --> 00:46:44.519
Here's what happens in 1 Samuel 17 that's awesome.

00:46:44.519 --> 00:46:46.519
You know who the only one is

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:48.519
that's going to do something for God?

00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:49.519
Who's the only one?

00:46:49.519 --> 00:46:50.519
David.

00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:52.519
Is there not a cause?

00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:54.519
And guess who criticizes him?

00:46:54.519 --> 00:46:58.519
Everybody else that's not doing anything.

00:46:58.519 --> 00:47:00.519
Am I not right?

00:47:00.519 --> 00:47:02.519
1 Samuel 17, is that not what happens?

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.519
You can't do this.

00:47:03.519 --> 00:47:04.519
You're here.

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:05.519
You're here.

00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:10.519
I know the pride of your heart.

00:47:10.519 --> 00:47:12.519
The reality is that David,

00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:14.519
he's going to stand before God,

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:17.519
and so are you.

00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:19.519
Before Saul and Eliab and all the others

00:47:19.519 --> 00:47:21.519
should be casting judgment at David,

00:47:21.519 --> 00:47:24.519
they should be examining their own hearts.

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:27.519
And we find here,

00:47:27.519 --> 00:47:29.519
he says it's to God.

00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:31.519
The rewards that will be received,

00:47:31.519 --> 00:47:33.519
their crowns I mentioned earlier,

00:47:33.519 --> 00:47:37.519
2 John 8 says that we may receive a full reward.

00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:39.519
The motivation in and of itself

00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:41.519
is not that we'd receive a crown or a reward,

00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:43.519
but we understand the truth of God's Word

00:47:43.519 --> 00:47:46.519
that there are rewards, crowns to be received.

00:47:46.519 --> 00:47:48.519
He tells it to us in the New Testament.

00:47:48.519 --> 00:47:49.519
There are many examples.

00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:51.519
Paul had confidence when he writes

00:47:51.519 --> 00:47:54.519
in 2 Timothy 4 about the day of his departure being at hand,

00:47:54.519 --> 00:47:55.519
and he says,

00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:58.519
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

00:47:58.519 --> 00:47:59.519
He knew.

00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:00.519
He had confidence.

00:48:00.519 --> 00:48:01.519
Why?

00:48:01.519 --> 00:48:03.519
Because he said that the righteous judge would give it to him,

00:48:03.519 --> 00:48:04.519
but not to me also,

00:48:04.519 --> 00:48:08.519
but also to all of them who love his appearing.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:10.519
What's going to happen with those crowns?

00:48:10.519 --> 00:48:12.519
I alluded to it a few minutes ago,

00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:14.519
but look at Revelation 4 this morning.

00:48:14.519 --> 00:48:16.519
Revelation chapter number 4.

00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:19.519
We get a glimpse into the throne room of heaven,

00:48:19.519 --> 00:48:23.519
and in verse number 9 of Revelation 4,

00:48:23.519 --> 00:48:24.519
the Bible says this,

00:48:24.519 --> 00:48:27.519
and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks

00:48:27.519 --> 00:48:29.519
to him that sat on the throne,

00:48:29.519 --> 00:48:31.519
who liveth forever and ever,

00:48:31.519 --> 00:48:33.519
the 4 and 20 elders fall down before him

00:48:33.519 --> 00:48:34.519
that sat on the throne

00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:36.519
and worship him that liveth forever and ever.

00:48:36.519 --> 00:48:38.519
And what does the Bible say there?

00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:42.519
And cast their crowns before the throne,

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:43.519
saying what?

00:48:43.519 --> 00:48:44.519
Verse number 11.

00:48:44.519 --> 00:48:48.519
Thou art worthy, O Lord,

00:48:48.519 --> 00:48:51.519
to receive glory and honor and power,

00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:53.519
for thou hast created all things

00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:57.519
and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

00:48:57.519 --> 00:48:58.519
Can I ask you this morning,

00:48:58.519 --> 00:48:59.519
do you want to be at that day

00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:05.519
with no crown to cast at the feet of our Lord?

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:08.519
That's a sobering truth.

00:49:08.519 --> 00:49:13.519
I want to have crowns to cast at the feet of my Savior.

00:49:13.519 --> 00:49:14.519
Don't you?

00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:16.519
That suffer loss is that,

00:49:16.519 --> 00:49:19.519
listen, you're not going to lose your salvation.

00:49:19.519 --> 00:49:21.519
There is therefore now no condemnation

00:49:21.519 --> 00:49:22.519
to them that are in Christ Jesus.

00:49:22.519 --> 00:49:24.519
You're not going to lose your salvation,

00:49:24.519 --> 00:49:25.519
but you're going to suffer loss

00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:27.519
when others are casting those crowns

00:49:27.519 --> 00:49:29.519
you have nothing to offer.

00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:31.519
Your life was one that would be described

00:49:31.519 --> 00:49:34.519
as being worthless from a perspective

00:49:34.519 --> 00:49:37.519
of what we did for God's glory.

00:49:37.519 --> 00:49:39.519
Wow.

00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:43.519
Paul says it this way, and I'll finish quickly.

00:49:43.519 --> 00:49:44.519
You don't need to turn there.

00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:48.519
Philippians chapter 3.

00:49:48.519 --> 00:49:54.519
Paul is speaking about his life,

00:49:54.519 --> 00:49:56.519
his pedigree, if you will.

00:49:56.519 --> 00:49:58.519
In Hebrew of the Hebrews.

00:49:58.519 --> 00:50:01.519
He says in verse number 7 of Philippians 3,

00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:06.519
but what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

00:50:06.519 --> 00:50:10.519
Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss,

00:50:10.519 --> 00:50:14.519
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,

00:50:14.519 --> 00:50:17.519
for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,

00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:21.519
and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:23.519
You know what that word dung means?

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:26.519
It means that which is worthless or detestable.

00:50:26.519 --> 00:50:28.519
That's what it means.

00:50:28.519 --> 00:50:30.519
He says here's what I count them as.

00:50:30.519 --> 00:50:32.519
It's worthless.

00:50:32.519 --> 00:50:35.519
That I may win Christ and be found in him,

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:38.519
not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,

00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:41.519
but that which is through the faith of Christ,

00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:46.519
the righteousness which is of God, by faith.

00:50:46.519 --> 00:50:51.519
Paul says listen, I'm going to stand before Christ and so are you.

00:50:51.519 --> 00:50:53.519
Are you ready?

00:50:53.519 --> 00:50:55.519
Are you ready for that?

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.519
He said I'm not ready.

00:50:57.519 --> 00:50:58.519
Get ready.

00:50:58.519 --> 00:51:01.519
Because you don't know when it's going to take place.

00:51:01.519 --> 00:51:07.519
I believe the desertion of Christ is probably going to happen right after we die.

00:51:07.519 --> 00:51:10.519
There are various thoughts with regard to the timing.

00:51:10.519 --> 00:51:13.519
It may be at some point during the tribulation,

00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:15.519
while we're in heaven, the bride of Christ.

00:51:15.519 --> 00:51:19.519
But regardless of the timing, you're going to stand before Christ and so am I.

00:51:19.519 --> 00:51:22.519
There's no excuses.

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:24.519
No excused absences.

00:51:24.519 --> 00:51:25.519
You'll be there.

00:51:25.519 --> 00:51:28.519
And are you ready to give an account?

00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:30.519
If you're here this morning and you're not saved,

00:51:30.519 --> 00:51:33.519
what you need is to be saved.

00:51:33.519 --> 00:51:35.519
Can I tell you that God offers to you eternal life,

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:38.519
salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:51:38.519 --> 00:51:41.519
He said today is the day of salvation.

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:46.519
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:51:46.519 --> 00:51:48.519
But for every child of God this morning,

00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:51.519
one day you're going to stand before Christ and so am I.

00:51:51.519 --> 00:51:53.519
How does it impact us?

00:51:53.519 --> 00:52:00.519
How does it alter our behavior to know that we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ?

00:52:00.519 --> 00:52:01.519
Let's pray together.

00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:02.519
Father, we love you.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:05.519
Thank you for loving us.

00:52:05.519 --> 00:52:13.519
God, I thank you this morning that you've revealed to us this truth.

00:52:14.519 --> 00:52:19.519
Indeed, a sobering truth.

00:52:19.519 --> 00:52:24.519
A fearful truth.

00:52:24.519 --> 00:52:27.519
But a truth nevertheless.

00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:34.519
God, I pray that we'd live our lives every day to please honor and glorify you.

00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:37.519
That we might bring honor and glory to thy name.

00:52:37.519 --> 00:52:45.519
That we may receive reward and not suffer loss.

00:52:45.519 --> 00:52:46.519
Use us, Lord.

00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:51.519
Work in this moment to do what only you can do in the hearts of your people.

00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:54.519
If there's one not sure of heaven,

00:52:54.519 --> 00:52:56.519
oh, I pray that we'd have an opportunity to take a Bible

00:52:56.519 --> 00:53:00.519
and show them how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:53:00.519 --> 00:53:04.519
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:04.519 --> 00:53:05.519
Would you stand with me?

00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:06.519
Heads are out, eyes are closed.

00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:08.519
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:09.519
And as she does, the altar is open.

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:12.519
At the end of each of our services, we have an opportunity for you to respond.

00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:14.519
If you're not sure of heaven, we'll have someone take a Bible

00:53:14.519 --> 00:53:17.519
and show you how you can know for sure heaven is your home.

00:53:17.519 --> 00:53:24.519
If you're saved, the reality of this judgment should cause us to respond.

00:53:24.519 --> 00:53:27.519
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
