1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,599
and this is message number two,

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:06,639
and we are, Lord willing, gonna get through

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,039
verses four through eight this evening.

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,479
Revelation one, verses four through eight.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,979
I'm gonna read the passage of scripture,

6
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,619
dig right in this evening.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,399
The Bible says, beginning in Revelation one,

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,559
in verse number four,

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,799
John to the seven churches which are in Asia,

10
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:24,479
grace be unto you and peace from him which is

11
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,840
and which was and which is to come,

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,200
and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,799
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,279
and the first begotten of the dead

15
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,799
and the prince of the kings of the earth,

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,680
unto him that loved us and washed us

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,200
from our sins in his own blood,

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,279
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father,

19
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,520
to him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,700
Behold, he cometh with clouds,

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,400
and every eye shall see him,

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,659
and they also which pierced him,

23
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,380
and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him,

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,099
even so, amen.

25
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,900
I am Alpha and Omega,

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,180
the beginning and the ending,

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,220
saith the Lord which is and which was

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,879
and which is to come, the Almighty.

29
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,580
This evening I've titled the message,

30
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,260
Get Your Eyes on Jesus,

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,339
and I want you to remember,

32
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,779
as I mentioned last week by way of introduction,

33
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,459
that the original recipients of this book of Revelation

34
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,379
were facing great adversity and persecution.

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,900
Domitian was the ruthless emperor,

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,019
and those that refused to worship him,

37
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,379
remember he gave that decree,

38
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:37,379
he claimed that he was to be worshiped as Lord and as God,

39
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,779
and we find that those that refused to bow to him,

40
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:44,739
they faced really grave consequences,

41
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,139
and we find that in the midst of that setting,

42
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,459
in the midst of all the turmoil

43
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,379
and the persecution and the difficulty,

44
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,819
I want you to notice that as we begin in verse number four,

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,779
the Bible says, John to the seven churches which are in Asia,

46
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:00,459
notice this, it's a familiar greeting

47
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,779
that's penned throughout the New Testament,

48
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:07,080
grace be unto you and peace.

49
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,460
This is so important that we understand

50
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,419
at the very onset of this particular study

51
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,419
and understanding that in the midst of great difficulty,

52
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,979
of great adversity and persecution,

53
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,580
that the Lord sends this message to his people

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,960
about grace and about peace.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,300
It's very interesting when you consider

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,220
the content of the book of Revelation,

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,899
it's a book that really is full of judgment,

58
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,479
it's a book that's full of turmoil,

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,779
but yet we find here on the beginning

60
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,539
of this entrance into this book,

61
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,580
he says grace and peace.

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,820
I want you to be mindful this evening

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,300
and rejoice in the fact that in the midst

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,460
of all that is going on around us,

65
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,360
that we have been given the grace of God.

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
The grace of God, we sing Amazing Grace,

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,440
I know it's Mr. Don's favorite song

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,759
and we think about that wonderful song Amazing Grace

69
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,960
and Paul mentions how that God's grace

70
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,039
is abundant and it is and we understand

71
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,720
that I am what I am by the grace of God

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,800
and we have been given grace.

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,279
By the way, I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

74
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,539
that our God is a gracious God.

75
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,580
Not only has he given us grace,

76
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,720
but we find in the verse it says and peace.

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,119
Again, in the midst of great turmoil and difficulty,

78
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,119
adversity and all that's going on,

79
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:27,479
we find that he grabs our attention

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,759
and speaks of these two attributes, grace and peace.

81
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,559
I'm thankful in the midst of turmoil,

82
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,119
we can have the peace of God,

83
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:38,000
which passeth all understanding.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,119
In the midst of facing a ruthless,

85
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,639
just wicked ruler, these people,

86
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,960
the original recipients, they could be mindful

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,600
of the fact that God has extended grace,

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,320
right, grace is saved through faith

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,919
and God's been gracious to us

90
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,479
and we find that they also can be reminded

91
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,199
of the peace that God gives.

92
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,220
I mentioned this morning in John 14 in verse 27

93
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,720
that Jesus said, my peace give I unto thee.

94
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm thankful that it's his peace.

95
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,199
I'm thankful that it's a perfect peace

96
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,160
and it's a peace that passeth all understanding.

97
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,679
It's interesting as we look at these few verses

98
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,480
of scripture this evening, I really appreciate

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,000
the opening passage because I believe

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,040
it grabs our attention and it presses us

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,359
to get our focus off of our circumstances

102
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,019
and to get our eyes on Jesus.

103
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,119
It's amazing when you begin reading this book

104
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,279
and you notice in these first few verses,

105
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,160
of course we studied verses one through three last week,

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,200
but verses four through eight and how still

107
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,640
in the introduction really of this book

108
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,859
that the reader, the recipient of this book

109
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:46,399
is really implored to get your eyes on Jesus.

110
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,440
It's really easy for us at times

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
to live under the circumstances.

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,600
It's really easy for us to get overwhelmed

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,839
with all the things going on in our world

114
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,160
and going on around us and the troubles

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,760
and the trials and the difficulties that we face,

116
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,079
but the reality is that we need to get the same message

117
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,200
that these recipients received and that God has preserved

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,839
so that we would receive it again this evening as well

119
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,440
and that is to get our eyes on Jesus.

120
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm thankful that he's the author

121
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,119
and the finisher of our faith.

122
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,839
We find in the text of scriptures,

123
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,079
we deal with the subject of get your eyes on Jesus.

124
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,920
If you're taking notes, number one,

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,359
I want you to recognize his person.

126
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,600
Recognize his person.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,040
There's no doubt as we read these verses of scripture

128
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,600
that the Trinity is in full view.

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,000
We find that the text of scripture,

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
as we mentioned last week in verse number one,

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's the revelation of Jesus Christ

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and we find that as we look at these few verses

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
of scripture that yes, the Trinity is in view

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,519
and I'm thankful for the truth

135
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,040
and the teaching of the Trinity.

136
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,959
However, we see this portrait, if you will,

137
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,279
of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ

138
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,760
and we begin to see some things with regard to who he is

139
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,880
and we get our eyes on who he is,

140
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
we find that he is eternal.

141
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,019
The Bible says here in verse number four

142
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,200
and again in verse number eight

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,160
and really verse number four is referencing the Father

144
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,700
if you're going to track the Trinity aspect

145
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,459
of what's being spoken of here

146
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,420
and verse four is speaking of the Father

147
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,959
and it says, from him which is and which was

148
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,920
and which is to come.

149
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,220
We find though that in verse number eight,

150
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,380
when it's speaking about Jesus,

151
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,579
he says, I am Alpha and Omega,

152
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,859
the beginning and the ending, sayeth the Lord,

153
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:36,859
which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty.

154
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,299
I'm thankful that our God is eternal.

155
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,140
I'm thankful that he is, he was and he is to come.

156
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,299
I'm thankful this evening that John, of course,

157
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:50,100
as he's writing, as the human penman writing this book,

158
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,140
he was extremely familiar with the eternality

159
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,420
of Jesus Christ.

160
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,980
In John chapter number one, we're reminded

161
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,299
of what John penned in the Gospel of John.

162
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:01,700
In John chapter number one,

163
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,380
we know that the Bible says in the beginning

164
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,619
was the Word and the Word was with God

165
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,459
and the Word was God.

166
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,820
He tells us in verse number 14

167
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,459
But I want you to notice specifically

169
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,779
that in verse number 15, John the Baptist is speaking

170
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,980
and it says that John bear witness of him

171
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,940
and cried saying, here's what John the Baptist said,

172
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,200
this was he of whom I spake, speaking of Jesus,

173
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,019
who that cometh after me is preferred before me, why?

174
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:33,059
For he was before me.

175
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,299
Now, if you understand the scriptures,

176
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:39,260
you understand that John the Baptist is older physically.

177
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,640
He was born first and then Jesus was born.

178
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,880
But John the Baptist is able to say in verse number 15

179
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,779
that he was before me, why?

180
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,839
Because he's eternal.

181
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,040
We find that in verse number 30 of John chapter number one,

182
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,820
this reference is made again.

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,239
This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man

184
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:01,720
which is preferred before me, for he was before me.

185
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,859
But then I want you to notice in John 17

186
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,820
John is recording this prayer of the Lord in John 17.

187
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,260
No doubt there are times in which people reference

188
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,579
this phraseology, the Lord's Prayer,

189
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,420
and they really are referencing the model prayer.

190
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,579
When the disciple said, Lord, teach us to pray

191
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,660
and Jesus said, here's how you pray.

192
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,859
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

193
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,260
That's the model prayer.

194
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,579
That's not the Lord's Prayer.

195
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,020
Really, John 17 is the Lord's Prayer.

196
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,219
We find that in John 17, Jesus knowing

197
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,700
that his hour was come and he's praying.

198
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,780
And it says in verse number one, it says,

199
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,299
these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven.

200
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,020
And he said, Father, the hour has come.

201
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,859
Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee.

202
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:51,340
Look at verse number five with me, if you will.

203
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,419
It says this, and now, O Father, glorify thou me

204
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,419
with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee

205
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,979
before the world was.

206
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,020
So as we begin looking at the book of Revelation

207
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,380
and we're seeing the revelation of Jesus Christ

208
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,820
and we find that we're to recognize his person

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,859
and understand who he is, he reveals to us

210
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:20,260
the eternality of himself, the fact that he has

211
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,059
no beginning and no ending.

212
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,340
He says in verse eight, I am Alpha and Omega.

213
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,900
He says, I am he that was and is and is to come.

214
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,820
And what a joy.

215
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,940
I want you to notice number two,

216
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,260
when you consider recognizing his person,

217
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,859
I want you to notice that he's faithful.

218
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,140
He's faithful.

219
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,179
Look at verse number five.

220
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,859
The Bible says I'm from Jesus Christ,

221
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,780
who is the faithful witness.

222
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,580
Let me say this just very briefly

223
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,340
as a interruption in thought.

224
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,619
If you look at the end of verse number four

225
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,460
and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,

226
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,700
that's where you see the Holy Spirit reference.

227
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,380
As I mentioned, the Trinity is in view.

228
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,539
When we begin to think about verse number five

229
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,940
and Jesus is referred to.

230
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,980
being the faithful witness.

231
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,100
I'm thankful that Paul declares it this way

232
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,200
in 1 Corinthians 1 and verse number nine

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,780
by simply saying God is faithful.

234
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,340
I'm thankful for Paul as he's writing to the church

235
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,580
in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 24.

236
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,660
He says faithful is he that calleth you

237
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,880
who also will do it.

238
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm thankful this evening that our God is faithful.

239
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,580
One of the songs that we sang on Friday evening

240
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,500
at the memorial service for Alexis' mom,

241
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,980
Ms. Susan was Great is Thy Faithfulness.

242
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,980
And I know that every time we kind of go around

243
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,280
and have opportunity for favorites

244
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,700
and we have on Mother's Day the ladies get to pick a song

245
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,960
and on Father's Day the men get to pick a song

246
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,860
and then on our prayer, praise and pie

247
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,260
we'll sing a whole lot of songs

248
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,420
and every once in a while

249
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,940
we'll have other times of favorites

250
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,700
and it just seems to me that almost every single time

251
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,100
Great is Thy Faithfulness is one of the songs

252
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,540
that is requested by someone from our congregation.

253
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,380
Why?

254
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,280
Because our God is faithful.

255
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,660
Our God is faithful and he is true.

256
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,520
We find that in Revelation 19 and verse number 11,

257
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,420
notice with me the way that this is articulated here.

258
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,540
This is when Christ comes back to earth

259
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,139
and we'll reference this in just a few moments again.

260
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,420
But it says in verse number 11 of Revelation 19,

261
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,459
and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse

262
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,660
and he that sat upon him was called what?

263
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,459
Faithful and true and in righteousness

264
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,620
he doth judge and make war.

265
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

266
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,100
He's trustworthy, he's dependable,

267
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,459
he's never failed, he never will.

268
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,660
I'm thankful this evening that his faithfulness

269
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,800
is not dependent on my faithfulness.

270
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Aren't you thankful for that?

271
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,240
You know why?

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,340
There've been times that we have, I have failed the Lord

273
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,180
but I'm thankful that he never fails.

274
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,139
He's faithful, he's faithful.

275
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,420
And here in verse number five it says

276
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,060
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness.

277
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,900
We find also as we consider his person this evening

278
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,139
that in verse number eight we are revealed

279
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,619
that he says at the end of the verse

280
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:11,940
that he is the almighty.

281
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,160
I want you to think about the name

282
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,220
that he ascribes to himself here

283
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
at the end of verse number eight.

284
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,979
He says that I am Alpha and Omega.

285
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,059
He's the beginning and the ending.

286
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,979
He says which is and which was

287
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:26,419
and which is to come the almighty.

288
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,339
Omnipotent, ruler of everything.

289
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:33,580
That's what it means, that's what it means.

290
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm reminded of the truth in Genesis chapter 17

291
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,419
when Abram has a visit from the Lord

292
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,740
and we find that God reveals himself to Abraham

293
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,619
as being El Shaddai is the Hebrew word, the name of God

294
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,839
and it means that he is the almighty one.

295
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm thankful that our God is the almighty God.

296
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,000
He has all power.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,419
There is nothing that's outside of his control.

298
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,520
We spoke of that some this morning

299
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
at the end of the message

300
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,639
and we find here again as we begin to think

301
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,119
about the people that are being written to originally

302
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,960
but then we understand that throughout church history

303
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,880
that as God has chosen to providentially preserve this book

304
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,119
and to allow us tonight to have the book of Revelation

305
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,260
that we need to get our eyes on Jesus

306
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,180
and we need to see who he is.

307
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,500
We need to understand that our God is eternal,

308
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
that he is outside of time,

309
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,940
that he knows the end from the beginning,

310
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,260
that he is faithful,

311
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,779
that he always does what he says he will do.

312
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,279
We can trust him.

313
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,419
I made this statement a few times this morning.

314
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,380
We are either gonna believe God or we're not.

315
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,779
We ought to believe him, he's faithful

316
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,040
and then we see that he is almighty.

317
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,760
Aren't you thankful that you know who he is?

318
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,639
I mean in just a few verses of scripture

319
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,440
all of a sudden if our attention is drawn to Jesus

320
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,839
and recognizing his person,

321
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,800
we're reminded about that peace

322
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,680
that he spoke of in verse number four

323
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,779
and we're reminded of the fact

324
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,760
that really it's gracious of God to reveal his person to us.

325
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm thankful this evening

326
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,839
that I don't have to try to figure out God on my own.

327
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm thankful this evening

328
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
that I don't have to rely on my own resources.

329
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
I don't have to go and try to figure out

330
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,279
who God is, God has given me a book

331
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,480
and in this precious book he has told me who he is.

332
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,279
There's a lot of people that don't know who God is

333
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,959
because they're trying to define God outside of the Bible.

334
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,360
We find that here this evening when we see him exalted,

335
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,380
when we get our eyes on Jesus,

336
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,640
we remember his person,

337
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,640
all of a sudden we're focused on who he is

338
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,360
and our attention is not so much on the circumstances

339
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,799
and the difficulties in which we're facing.

340
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,700
We see number one this evening, recognize his person,

341
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
number two, remember his passion.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,619
In verses five and six,

343
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,980
we find that the Lord gives us truth

344
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,880
with regard to his passion, his work.

345
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,000
In verse number five,

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,720
his death and resurrection are clearly seen

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,679
and in verse number five the Bible says,

348
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,640
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness,

349
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,839
notice in the first begotten of the dead

350
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
and the prince of the kings of the earth,

351
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,000
we find that as we look here

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,799
and see that the Bible continues in verse five

353
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,640
and says unto him that loved us

354
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,519
and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

355
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,320
So we find that in verse number five

356
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,679
that the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

357
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,200
are in clear view and we must remember that.

358
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
We must remember what he did for us.

359
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,080
We must understand this evening that he rose from the dead,

360
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,440
conquering sin, death and the grave.

361
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,959
He is alive forevermore.

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He makes that declaration later

363
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
at the end of chapter number one

364
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,940
and I'm so thankful that I serve a risen savior.

365
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,779
I'm so thankful.

366
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,179
Listen, we're all gonna face death

367
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,760
and we have placed our faith in the one

368
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
who has conquered death.

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,760
And the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter number two

370
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,279
that we no longer have to have the fear of death.

371
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,119
Why?

372
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:10,720
Because our God has conquered death.

373
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,739
Oh death, where is thy sting?

374
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,720
Oh grave, where is thy victory?

375
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,540
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

376
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,980
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

377
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,360
First Corinthians 15, you read the whole chapter.

378
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,260
I mean, you see the resurrection in that chapter

379
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,239
like you see it nowhere else in the Bible

380
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:30,779
in one condensed area and what a joy this evening to know.

381
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,660
But look at the text here.

382
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,980
It says in verse number five at the end,

383
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,040
unto him that loved us.

384
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,100
You know why he went to the cross?

385
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,399
Because he loved us.

386
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,640
Because he loved us.

387
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,260
The Bible says in John three in verse 16,

388
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,940
a verse that many of us are familiar with.

389
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,339
In fact, it's John again that penned those words

390
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,779
that Jesus spoke to Nicodemus.

391
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,940
Nicodemus comes to Jesus and he says,

392
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,100
we know that you're a ruler, a teacher,

393
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,580
that you have done these things

394
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,739
and I mean, they're convinced of it

395
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:09,660
and Jesus speaks to him about the need of being born again.

396
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
And then we go through the text of scripture

397
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,019
and we come to verse 16, a verse that is so familiar,

398
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,860
so precious, for God so loved the world

399
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,820
that he gave his only begotten son,

400
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,860
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish

401
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,660
but have everlasting life.

402
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,619
Aren't you thankful for that verse of scripture?

403
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:35,260
For God so loved the world.

404
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,260
We find that in John three in verse 16,

405
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,739
it tells us that precious truth here

406
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,260
in Revelation one in verse five,

407
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,540
it says unto him that loved us.

408
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,820
We're reminded that in John 13 in verse number one,

409
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,260
at the end of the text that Jesus will speak

410
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,040
about loving one another as he loved them.

411
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,619
But he says in John 13 in verse number one,

412
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,940
it says this, having loved his own,

413
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,220
which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

414
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,260
I'm thankful tonight that there's nothing

415
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,140
that can separate me from the love of God.

416
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,019
I'm thankful for that.

417
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,940
It caused us to rejoice in that.

418
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,059
He loved us, he continues to love us.

419
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,899
Notice in first John, again, as we reference

420
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:19,299
various passages that God used the apostle John

421
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,500
to pin with the similar subject in first John three

422
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,380
in verse number 16, by the way,

423
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,220
it's an interesting study to see John 316

424
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,100
next to first John 316, for the Bible says

425
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,099
in first John 316, hereby perceive we the love of God.

426
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,960
How is it that we perceive the love of God?

427
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,340
Because he laid down his life for us

428
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,580
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

429
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,020
He laid down his life for us.

430
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,099
John talks about in John chapter number 10,

431
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,659
Jesus says I am the good shepherd.

432
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,000
And he says that the good shepherd,

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
what does the good shepherd do?

434
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,460
He gives his life for the sheep.

435
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,979
See, no one's gonna take it from him.

436
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:03,739
In fact, even while he was on the cross of Calvary,

437
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,739
you understand that the Bible says

438
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:08,320
that he gave up the ghost.

439
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,340
He gave up the ghost.

440
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,900
He laid his life down as a sacrifice,

441
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,580
as the sacrifice that was required

442
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,720
to pay for my sin and your sin and the sin of the world.

443
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,179
No man takes it from him.

444
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,419
He says in John 10 that he not only

445
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,619
is gonna lay his life down,

446
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,580
but he's gonna take it up again.

447
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,340
He speaks of the resurrection right there

448
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,020
in the same passage of scripture.

449
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,820
And what a joy to know that he did.

450
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,979
Listen, the disciples,

451
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,859
if you read through the gospel accounts

452
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,179
after the announcement of the resurrection,

453
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,500
there's all kinds of confusion.

454
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
They run and they're troubled

455
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,020
and they don't know what's going on.

456
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,679
And then they remember,

457
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,580
oh, this is what Jesus was telling us about.

458
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,059
And they remembered.

459
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,659
Listen, this evening,

460
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:57,419
we have to be reminded of the truth that God loved us.

461
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,020
And his love is what sent him to the cross of,

462
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,500
Calvary, he gave up the ghost,

463
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,460
he willingly laid down his life.

464
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,420
Remember, Pilate was so confused

465
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,220
when they said that he was dead already,

466
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,740
typically because of the circumstances

467
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,100
at that particular time,

468
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,500
and what they did to the thieves

469
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,820
is they broke the legs so that they would die quickly.

470
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,460
They tried to make crucifixion

471
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,340
as long as they possibly could

472
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,520
to make it as torturous,

473
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,580
and also to cause others to be walking a straighter line

474
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,580
because they don't want to end up in that same position.

475
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,780
And we find that Pilate said he's dead already,

476
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,340
yeah, but the Psalms said that no bones would be broken.

477
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,500
The Bible's awesome.

478
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,620
And we find that 1 John 4 and verse number 10,

479
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,640
the Bible says, herein is love,

480
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,680
not that we love God, but that he loved us

481
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,680
and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.

482
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,900
This evening, when we begin to remember his passion,

483
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,420
we recognize his person, but we remember his passion,

484
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,660
we remember all that he suffered there at Calvary,

485
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,140
all that he suffered leading up to Calvary,

486
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,860
all that he endured on that cross,

487
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,780
and we understand it's because he loved us.

488
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,820
It's because he loved us.

489
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,020
But then the Bible says this in Revelation 1

490
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,420
and verse number five,

491
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,140
not only unto him that loved us,

492
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,140
but it says, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

493
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,060
This reveals to us the cleansing work of Calvary,

494
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,900
the fact that we needed to have that blood.

495
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,820
We sang this evening about the blood

496
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,100
and what a great song to start our service this evening,

497
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,580
singing about the blood.

498
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,940
And we find that this evening,

499
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,620
the truth that I prayed that without the shedding of blood,

500
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,580
there's no remission, we have forgiveness,

501
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,580
redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

502
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,980
And he washed us from our sins in his own blood.

503
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,540
You know, the reality is that all of us have sinned

504
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,020
and all of us must have the blood applied.

505
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,700
We sing the song, we didn't sing it this evening,

506
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,980
we sing the song, are you washed in the blood?

507
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,820
You know it?

508
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,940
Are you washed in the blood?

509
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,700
It asks questions in the soul, cleansing blood of the lamb.

510
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,260
And every time we sing that song,

511
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,000
at that point right there, I say this, yes, I am.

512
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,020
You say, why do you say that?

513
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,260
Because I want to, amen.

514
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,580
Because the spirit led me to, amen.

515
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,060
Because I am saved by the blood of the lamb.

516
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,220
And when it says, are you washed in the blood

517
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,340
and the soul cleansing blood of the lamb?

518
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,000
I say, yes, I am.

519
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,240
I am saved by the blood of Christ.

520
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,180
By the way, there's no other way to be saved, amen.

521
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,800
It's the only way to be saved.

522
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,420
Are your garments spotless?

523
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,500
Are they white as snow?

524
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,700
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

525
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,660
It's a great song.

526
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,380
And we find here that as the book of Revelation

527
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,340
is being given to us in these introductory statements

528
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,780
before the messages even come to the churches in Asia

529
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,300
that we'll read and we'll study the details of them,

530
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,880
we find that he's telling us that these messages,

531
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,140
that these letters are coming from God

532
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,100
and we must get our attention on him.

533
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,460
We must get our eyes on our Lord

534
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,000
and we must understand that he is eternal,

535
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,800
that he is almighty, that he is faithful.

536
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,960
We must understand that he loved us

537
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,280
and that he washed us, he cleansed us.

538
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,360
And then we see in verse number six,

539
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,760
the beginning of the verse, notice what he did.

540
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,960
After we got saved, it says that he hath made us kings

541
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,360
and priests unto God and his father.

542
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,960
You know, that's a privileged position that he gave us.

543
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,800
You know, it's a joy to be said that I'm a child of God.

544
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm a child of the king, amen, we sing the song.

545
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,560
And the reality is that I've been adopted, hallelujah.

546
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,600
I'm a child of the king.

547
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,920
And we find this evening the truth

548
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,480
that I'm joint heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ,

549
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,900
that he calls me his son.

550
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,240
Remember John one in verse number 11,

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,500
he came to his own, but his own received him not.

552
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,520
But verse number 12, but as many as received him

553
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,100
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

554
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,760
even to them that believe on his name.

555
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,360
It's a joy.

556
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,160
I think about the Old Testament.

557
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,400
I believe it's 2 Samuel chapter nine, Mephibosheth.

558
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,800
And Mephibosheth was the son of Jonathan

559
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,400
and Mephibosheth was crippled

560
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,760
and Mephibosheth could do nothing for himself.

561
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,240
But David the king, he wanted to show kindness

562
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,000
to the house of Saul, that's what the Bible says.

563
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
He wanted to show kindness to the house of Saul.

564
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,440
And he said, is there any yet alive?

565
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,080
And someone told him, there's this one Mephibosheth,

566
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,280
the son of Jonathan down in Lodabar.

567
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,320
He says, call for him.

568
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,840
And Mephibosheth is brought there

569
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
because he's crippled and he comes there

570
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,860
and he's concerned.

571
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,360
I believe that he thought,

572
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,760
I believe that he believed he was gonna be killed

573
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,040
because that was so common in the age,

574
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
the era in which those events took place.

575
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,040
You know what David says?

576
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,080
I'm gonna make you as one of the king's sons.

577
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,600
You're gonna sit at my table.

578
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm gonna give you all the provision.

579
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,600
He gave him land.

580
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,820
And you say, why would he give him land?

581
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,840
The man is crippled.

582
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,080
Well, he gave him servants to go with the land

583
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,160
because Mephibosheth himself couldn't take care of the land

584
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,120
so he gave him all the provision.

585
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,680
And he said, you're gonna sit at my table

586
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
as one of the king's sons.

587
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,840
Man, it's awesome to read that passage of scripture.

588
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,180
And what a great picture it is

589
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,380
that I have been made a child of God.

590
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,560
He says specifically here in verse six,

591
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,320
that he hath made us, notice kings and priests,

592
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,240
begin to understand the fact that this gives us

593
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,740
the opportunity and the privilege to be able to serve him.

594
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,440
You think about that truth of the priesthood of the believer

595
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,940
in 1 Peter chapter two,

596
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,160
just a few pages back in your Bible,

597
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,140
we notice in this portion of scripture,

598
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,560
the truth of the priesthood of the believer.

599
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,040
The Bible says in verse number nine

600
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
in 1 Peter chapter two,

601
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,000
but ye are a chosen generation,

602
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,440
a royal priesthood and holy nation,

603
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,640
a peculiar people that you should show forth

604
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,960
the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness

605
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
into his marvelous light,

606
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
which in time past were not a people,

607
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,080
but are now the people of God,

608
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,600
which had not obtained mercy,

609
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,640
but now have obtained mercy.

610
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,880
Aren't you thankful?

611
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,840
He's made us a priest.

612
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,780
You know that we can serve him.

613
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,320
We can bring him the offerings.

614
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,240
We can enter into his presence.

615
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,740
Hebrews 13 in verse 15 talks about bringing continually

616
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,300
the sacrifice of the praise of our lips

617
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,940
and what a joy to know that we can serve him

618
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,940
because of how he's made us a king and a priest.

619
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,060
We find that we can serve him now,

620
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,980
but we also see the truth here that is further developed

621
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,060
as we go through the book of Revelation

622
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
that will serve him during the millennial reign

623
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,600
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

624
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,220
Jesus is literally gonna reign for a thousand years.

625
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,540
And by the way, someone asked a great question this morning.

626
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,540
They said, I know that you mentioned

627
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,020
that Jesus is gonna reign for a thousand years,

628
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,620
but can you help me understand that?

629
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,580
Because God said that a thousand years is a day

630
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,100
and a day is a thousand years.

631
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,460
Is it really a thousand years?

632
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,500
And I said, yes, it is.

633
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
And here's why.

634
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,820
He's speaking to us from our perspective of time,

635
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
not his perspective of time.

636
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,440
Isaiah talks about the one that dies at a hundred

637
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,260
is gonna die like a child.

638
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,900
And so obviously a thousand literal years

639
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,540
as we would calculate time.

640
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,260
And so we find that he's gonna rule and reign,

641
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,900
but he says that he's made us kings and priests

642
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,860
and we're gonna rule and reign with him.

643
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,540
It's further developed as we get into chapter 20

644
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,600
of the book of Revelation in verses one through six.

645
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,900
And we'll get there in about five years, I guess,

646
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,300
according to brother Hummel,

647
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,900
but we'll get there and we'll study and we'll see

648
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,500
what that looks like in the millennial reign of Christ.

649
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,900
But what a joy to be able to serve him today,

650
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,700
to have that position.

651
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,620
See, that's what he did for us.

652
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,380
I notice in first Peter chapter two in verse number 10,

653
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,700
I read it just a moment ago,

654
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,620
but I noticed where the scripture said,

655
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,580
which in time past were not a people,

656
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,840
but are now the people of God.

657
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,540
I hope that just that simple thought

658
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,980
from that portion of verse number 10

659
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,200
encourages you tonight.

660
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,300
Because before salvation, we were not a people.

661
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,220
We were lost on our way to a Christless eternity.

662
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,660
But thankfully, the Lord Jesus Christ took our place.

663
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,260
We need to remember the work that he did,

664
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,420
remember his passion.

665
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,700
Number three, recall his promise.

666
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,080
In verse number seven, notice with me,

667
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
the Bible says this,

668
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,920
"'Behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him

669
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,540
"'and they also which pierced him

670
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,880
"'in all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

671
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,900
"'Even so, amen.'"

672
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,619
We find here in verse number seven,

673
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:11,460
the Bible says, "'Behold, he cometh.'"

674
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,300
It tells us that every eye shall see him.

675
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,820
It also tells us they which pierced him would see him.

676
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,820
That's speaking about the Jews or Israel as a nation.

677
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,739
And we find that here in verse number seven,

678
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,140
it's important that we understand this evening

679
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,420
that the obvious reference to Christ's return here

680
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,220
is when he returns all the way to the earth

681
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,760
at the end of the tribulation.

682
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,640
Let me very quickly try to help us understand this idea

683
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,480
or the teaching, the biblical truth

684
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,400
with regard to the return of Christ.

685
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,360
There's really two aspects to the return of Christ.

686
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,880
He's going to return in the air,

687
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
according to 1 Thessalonians chapter number four.

688
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,280
And when he returns in the air,

689
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,160
the Bible says that we which are alive,

690
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,040
the dead in Christ shall rise first,

691
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
then we which are alive.

692
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,740
and remains shall be caught up together with him,

693
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,540
and we're gonna meet him in the air,

694
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,220
and we're gonna be with him forever.

695
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
He's not gonna come all the way to earth

696
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,300
at that first time, he's just gonna come in the air.

697
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,900
And by the way, it seems clear,

698
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,340
we'll look at a few verses here in just a moment,

699
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
that not every eye is gonna see him.

700
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,860
In fact, 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

701
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,440
and verse number two says that he's coming

702
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,360
like a thief in the night.

703
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,240
The Bible says in a moment, the twinkling of an eye,

704
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,140
which is faster than you can blink, 1 Corinthians 15,

705
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,240
that's how he's gonna return at that point.

706
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,240
But then, in that event, which we refer to as the rapture,

707
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,940
why don't we use the word rapture?

708
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,420
People come and say, well, the rapture's

709
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,860
not even in the Bible, that's because

710
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,420
they're looking for the word rapture.

711
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,700
Do you know that the word dinosaur

712
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,820
is not in the Bible either?

713
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,220
Does that mean there are no dinosaurs?

714
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
I read something this week that said,

715
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,860
science proves the Bible wrong,

716
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,500
because dinosaurs aren't in the Bible.

717
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,680
Come on, man, the word dinosaur didn't even

718
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,800
come into existence until the 19th century.

719
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,480
How's the word gonna be in the Bible

720
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
if it didn't even exist?

721
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
Right, and they're like, well,

722
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,280
let's not talk about the facts.

723
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,180
But the reality is that, listen,

724
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,200
the fact that the word rapture is not there

725
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,640
doesn't mean there's not a rapture,

726
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
because the word caught up means rapture.

727
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,040
If you study the Greek and you understand it,

728
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,880
that's what it means, it means to be caught up,

729
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,080
to be raptured, all right?

730
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,140
We find here that that's what's going to start

731
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,620
that seven-year period of time

732
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,660
that we refer to as the tribulation,

733
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,860
and that will be taking place here on earth.

734
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,340
Remember I mentioned to you last week

735
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,920
that when you study the book of Revelation,

736
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,500
there'll be scenes in heaven and scenes on earth,

737
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,320
and they sometimes just go back and forth,

738
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,860
these scenes that we find throughout the book of Revelation,

739
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,700
and so we find that really, to begin chapter number four

740
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,780
of the book of Revelation is where we see

741
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,940
the rapture of the church really taking place,

742
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,460
and John being escorted into heaven.

743
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,080
You see in chapters two and three

744
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,560
the references of the letters to the church.

745
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,520
After that point, no longer do you see

746
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,200
any reference to the church until chapter 19,

747
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,640
and in chapter 19, the reference that you see

748
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
with the church is the saints,

749
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,780
and we're coming back with him, okay?

750
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,520
So when we look at this and we see this reference

751
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
in Revelation one and verse number seven,

752
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,540
and behold, he cometh with clouds,

753
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,220
and every eye shall see him,

754
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,020
this is referring not to the rapture,

755
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,700
but to the end of the tribulation

756
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,260
when he returns all the way to earth,

757
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,580
and he's gonna literally set his foot down,

758
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,340
and we see, we're gonna look at Zechariah here

759
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,340
in just a moment, and we find that this event

760
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,380
is fully developed or more fully explained

761
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,380
as we get to the book of Revelation in the 19th chapter.

762
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,260
We find that we read verse number 11,

763
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,120
and then you continue from there, and you see that,

764
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,480
but look back at the book of Zechariah, if you will,

765
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,880
very quickly, I wanna look at two verses of scripture

766
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,320
in the book of Zechariah.

767
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,840
The easiest way to find Zechariah is to find Matthew

768
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,360
and then go backwards to Malachi

769
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,600
and backwards again to Zechariah, all right?

770
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,360
So if you're struggling, that's the easiest way to find it,

771
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,760
at least the easiest way I have learned to find it.

772
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,320
Zechariah chapter number 12, look at verse number 10.

773
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,760
The Bible says, and I will pour upon the house of David

774
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,820
and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

775
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,580
the spirit of grace and of supplication,

776
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,220
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced,

777
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,020
and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth

778
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,580
for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him

779
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,740
as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.

780
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,060
Now, here's where we see about they're gonna look upon him

781
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,140
who they pierced, and we see that in Revelation 1

782
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,860
in verse number seven, but now skip over to chapter 14,

783
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,620
if you will, and look at verse number four.

784
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,260
The Bible says this, and his feet shall stand in that day

785
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,800
upon the Mount of Olives.

786
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,280
How many have ever stood on the Mount of Olives?

787
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,720
All right, some of you stood there.

788
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,680
I remember standing on the Mount of Olives,

789
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,760
and I remember as I stood there, we sat up,

790
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,400
there's a little place where you can sit up there

791
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,820
and oversee, and I mean, you can, it's amazing

792
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,400
as you look over the valley and you see the Temple Mount

793
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,220
and all that you see, and at the bottom,

794
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,740
between the Temple Mount and the valley,

795
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,480
you see the Garden of Gethsemane, I mean, it's amazing.

796
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,880
It's a treacherous walk down that walkway there,

797
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,060
very, very, very steep, but the reality is that

798
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,720
when I stood there, you know what I thought?

799
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,840
One day, Jesus is coming back, and he's gonna put his foot

800
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,760
right here on the Mount of Olives.

801
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,240
It's what the Bible says, and it says in verse number four,

802
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,880
which is before Jerusalem on the east,

803
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,680
and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof

804
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,000
toward the east and toward the west.

805
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,400
It's gonna literally split it open.

806
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
The Bible says, and there shall be a very great valley,

807
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,800
and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north,

808
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
and half of it toward the south.

809
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,220
So I stood on the Mount of Olives, and I thought about this.

810
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,280
In fact, we read the passage of Scripture.

811
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,420
It's gonna happen, but that's gonna happen

812
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,300
in Revelation 19, is the timing in the book of Revelation.

813
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,420
So here in Revelation one, when here John is speaking

814
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,580
about the fact that the Lord cometh,

815
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,180
he's speaking specifically about Revelation 19

816
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,020
when he comes at the end of the tribulation,

817
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,000
but we must rejoice and recall the promise that he gave,

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,220
even as John is mindful in John 14,

819
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,000
as he had the privilege of writing those words,

820
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,460
let not your heart be troubled.

821
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,320
If you believe in God, believe also in me.

822
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,080
In my Father's house are many mansions.

823
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,720
If it were not so, I would have told you.

824
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,000
And then he says this, I go to prepare a place for you,

825
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,020
and if I go and prepare a place, I'll come again

826
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,440
and receive you unto myself,

827
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,560
that where I am, there ye may be also.

828
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
And he said, I come again.

829
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
I will come again.

830
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,840
Remember, he's the faithful witness, right?

831
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,560
Verse number five is the faithful witness.

832
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,880
He said, I will come again.

833
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,260
John says this in 1 John chapter number two.

834
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,600
We mentioned John 14 and 1 John chapter two

835
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
in verse number 28, the Bible says,

836
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,880
and now little children abide in him

837
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,840
that when he shall appear, not if he shall appear,

838
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,080
but when he shall appear, he's coming.

839
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,740
We may have confidence and not be ashamed

840
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,480
before him that is coming.

841
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,460
If it tells us this, then we know that it is possible

842
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,680
that some could be ashamed of him that is appearing.

843
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,180
Verse 29, if you know that he is righteous,

844
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,080
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

845
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,180
is born of him, chapter three and verse one.

846
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,240
Behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us

847
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,320
that we should be called the sons of God.

848
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,420
Really, that goes right back to verse number six

849
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,060
and five in Revelation that he loved us

850
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,120
and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

851
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,700
Therefore, the world knoweth us not

852
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,720
because it knew him not.

853
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,540
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

854
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,980
And it does not yet appear what we shall be,

855
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,180
but we know that again, when he shall appear,

856
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,180
we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.

857
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,440
And every man that hath this hope in him

858
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,940
purifies himself even as he is pure.

859
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
In Acts one, so John had the privilege of hearing Jesus say

860
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,040
in John 14 and then recording,

861
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,520
let not your heart be troubled.

862
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,760
And that verse, those verses that I quoted for you

863
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,640
a moment ago, he had the privilege of recording for us

864
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,960
first John 2, 28 down through chapter three

865
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,260
in verse number three about the return.

866
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,340
But then John had the privilege of standing

867
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,200
in Acts chapter number one when he watched Jesus ascend

868
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,220
back up into heaven.

869
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,900
And as John was part of that group that stood there

870
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,580
as Jesus ascended back up into heaven,

871
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,580
he heard the angel say, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

872
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,340
This same Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven

873
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,360
shall so come in like manner.

874
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,500
What a joy, what a joy.

875
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,840
Listen, we need to recall this promise.

876
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,100
We don't know when he's coming, but we know that he is.

877
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,260
I said this last week, imminent and immediate

878
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,140
are not the same thing.

879
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,100
The reality is that when God gives us the teaching

880
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,860
in his word of the imminent return of Christ,

881
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,220
it really is a precious, God has all wisdom, all right?

882
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,820
And sometimes he just lets us get a little bit

883
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,060
of his wisdom, but he has all wisdom.

884
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,060
And with having all wisdom, he knew that he could give

885
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
this teaching of the imminent return of Christ

886
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,920
and every generation of believer would live,

887
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,520
understanding that it could happen in their time.

888
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,380
It's amazing.

889
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,540
Jesus didn't give us the day.

890
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,020
The disciples were asking in Acts chapter one,

891
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,200
he said, it's not for you to know.

892
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
We just gotta be busy about the work

893
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,840
that he's given us to do.

894
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,400
And so this evening, what's the result?

895
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,260
When we get our eyes on Jesus, we take the thought

896
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,600
of this message tonight, get your eyes on Jesus.

897
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,720
When we recognize this person, when we remember his passion,

898
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,140
when we recall his promise, when we're focused upon Jesus,

899
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,040
what is it that will be the result?

900
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,280
Well, look at the end of verse number six.

901
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,280
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

902
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,400
Listen, when you get your eyes on Jesus,

903
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,500
you know what you start doing?

904
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,340
You start worshiping him.

905
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,520
You start praising him.

906
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,260
Why?

907
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,320
Because you're seeing him for who he is.

908
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,040
You're getting your eyes on Jesus.

909
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,020
You're not so focused on all the circumstances of life,

910
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,520
all the things going on around us.

911
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
Can I tell you this?

912
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,320
Even there's a lot of things pulling for our attention.

913
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,480
A lot of voices in the world,

914
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,360
a lot of things that are trying to get us distracted.

915
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,440
I preached a few weeks ago on Sunday morning

916
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,260
about a good soldier not being distracted.

917
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,580
And here we find that if we get our eyes on Jesus,

918
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,640
we can rejoice in knowing who he is,

919
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,720
what he has done for us, and what he is still going to do.

920
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,300
He's coming back for us.

921
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,240
Someone said this to me this morning.

922
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,320
They said, I don't know a whole lot of things,

923
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,160
but one thing that I do know

924
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,960
is that whether I have to live through some difficulties

925
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,960
and I die a martyr, or if I just live in peace and freedom

926
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
and I just die of old age,

927
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,280
I know is I'm going to see Jesus. Hallelujah. I understand, I'd rather die just of old age

928
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,360
and not have to go through all the tribulation and all the difficulty, but the Bible says

929
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,380
that we'll face persecution, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer

930
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,460
persecution. I really think tonight that we need to be prepared for it. I'm going to preach

931
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,160
a message in just a couple of Sunday mornings of preparing for persecution. 1 John chapter,

932
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,520
or excuse me, 2 Timothy chapter number 3. You say, you really think it's going to happen?

933
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,760
I don't know, because I'm not a prophet in that sense of foretelling, but I can foretell

934
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,520
what the Bible says, and the reality is we better be prepared for it. Amen? When we look

935
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:46,320
at these people that we're facing under Domitian's rule, terrible, terrible times, grace, peace,

936
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:54,100
why? Because we get our eyes on Jesus. And we recall, we recall His promise, that last

937
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,660
point that we dealt with, we remember His passion, that what He did for us, and then

938
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:04,940
we recognize His person. And we just see how lovely and how wonderful He is. And what will

939
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:12,500
happen is we'll begin rejoicing to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

940
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,980
Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word

941
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,060
tonight. We thank You for the truth of it. I pray, Lord, that You would help us to get

942
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,180
our eyes on Jesus. Lord, we understand that we're living in a difficult time. We have

943
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,700
all sorts of things going on around us. And Lord, we pray that You would just work in

944
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,700
our hearts and lives, that You would help us, Lord, to take the truth of this short

945
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,980
portion of Scripture, Lord, that we'd get our eyes on You. Move and work in this time

946
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,540
of invitation as only You can, and we'll give You the glory for it. In Christ's name, we

947
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,980
pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play

948
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
quietly on the piano.
