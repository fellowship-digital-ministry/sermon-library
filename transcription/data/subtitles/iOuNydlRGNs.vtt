WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.599
and this is message number two,

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:06.639
and we are, Lord willing, gonna get through

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.039
verses four through eight this evening.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.479
Revelation one, verses four through eight.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.979
I'm gonna read the passage of scripture,

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.619
dig right in this evening.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.399
The Bible says, beginning in Revelation one,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:18.559
in verse number four,

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.799
John to the seven churches which are in Asia,

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.479
grace be unto you and peace from him which is

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:26.840
and which was and which is to come,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.200
and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.799
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.279
and the first begotten of the dead

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.799
and the prince of the kings of the earth,

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.680
unto him that loved us and washed us

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.200
from our sins in his own blood,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.279
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father,

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:49.520
to him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700
Behold, he cometh with clouds,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
and every eye shall see him,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.659
and they also which pierced him,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.380
and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.099
even so, amen.

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:03.900
I am Alpha and Omega,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.180
the beginning and the ending,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.220
saith the Lord which is and which was

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.879
and which is to come, the Almighty.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.580
This evening I've titled the message,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.260
Get Your Eyes on Jesus,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.339
and I want you to remember,

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:18.779
as I mentioned last week by way of introduction,

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:22.459
that the original recipients of this book of Revelation

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.379
were facing great adversity and persecution.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.900
Domitian was the ruthless emperor,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.019
and those that refused to worship him,

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.379
remember he gave that decree,

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:37.379
he claimed that he was to be worshiped as Lord and as God,

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.779
and we find that those that refused to bow to him,

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:44.739
they faced really grave consequences,

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.139
and we find that in the midst of that setting,

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.459
in the midst of all the turmoil

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.379
and the persecution and the difficulty,

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.819
I want you to notice that as we begin in verse number four,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.779
the Bible says, John to the seven churches which are in Asia,

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:00.459
notice this, it's a familiar greeting

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.779
that's penned throughout the New Testament,

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.080
grace be unto you and peace.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.460
This is so important that we understand

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.419
at the very onset of this particular study

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.419
and understanding that in the midst of great difficulty,

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.979
of great adversity and persecution,

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.580
that the Lord sends this message to his people

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.960
about grace and about peace.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.300
It's very interesting when you consider

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.220
the content of the book of Revelation,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.899
it's a book that really is full of judgment,

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:33.479
it's a book that's full of turmoil,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.779
but yet we find here on the beginning

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.539
of this entrance into this book,

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.580
he says grace and peace.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820
I want you to be mindful this evening

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.300
and rejoice in the fact that in the midst

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.460
of all that is going on around us,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.360
that we have been given the grace of God.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.520
The grace of God, we sing Amazing Grace,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.440
I know it's Mr. Don's favorite song

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.759
and we think about that wonderful song Amazing Grace

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.960
and Paul mentions how that God's grace

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.039
is abundant and it is and we understand

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.720
that I am what I am by the grace of God

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.800
and we have been given grace.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.279
By the way, I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.539
that our God is a gracious God.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:16.580
Not only has he given us grace,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.720
but we find in the verse it says and peace.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.119
Again, in the midst of great turmoil and difficulty,

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.119
adversity and all that's going on,

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.479
we find that he grabs our attention

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.759
and speaks of these two attributes, grace and peace.

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.559
I'm thankful in the midst of turmoil,

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.119
we can have the peace of God,

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.000
which passeth all understanding.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.119
In the midst of facing a ruthless,

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.639
just wicked ruler, these people,

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.960
the original recipients, they could be mindful

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.600
of the fact that God has extended grace,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320
right, grace is saved through faith

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.919
and God's been gracious to us

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.479
and we find that they also can be reminded

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.199
of the peace that God gives.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.220
I mentioned this morning in John 14 in verse 27

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.720
that Jesus said, my peace give I unto thee.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.080
I'm thankful that it's his peace.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.199
I'm thankful that it's a perfect peace

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.160
and it's a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.679
It's interesting as we look at these few verses

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.480
of scripture this evening, I really appreciate

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.000
the opening passage because I believe

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.040
it grabs our attention and it presses us

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.359
to get our focus off of our circumstances

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.019
and to get our eyes on Jesus.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.119
It's amazing when you begin reading this book

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:32.279
and you notice in these first few verses,

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.160
of course we studied verses one through three last week,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.200
but verses four through eight and how still

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.640
in the introduction really of this book

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.859
that the reader, the recipient of this book

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:46.399
is really implored to get your eyes on Jesus.

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.440
It's really easy for us at times

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.440
to live under the circumstances.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.600
It's really easy for us to get overwhelmed

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.839
with all the things going on in our world

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.160
and going on around us and the troubles

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760
and the trials and the difficulties that we face,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.079
but the reality is that we need to get the same message

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.200
that these recipients received and that God has preserved

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.839
so that we would receive it again this evening as well

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.440
and that is to get our eyes on Jesus.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.480
I'm thankful that he's the author

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.119
and the finisher of our faith.

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:18.839
We find in the text of scriptures,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.079
we deal with the subject of get your eyes on Jesus.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.920
If you're taking notes, number one,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.359
I want you to recognize his person.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.600
Recognize his person.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.040
There's no doubt as we read these verses of scripture

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.600
that the Trinity is in full view.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000
We find that the text of scripture,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
as we mentioned last week in verse number one,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
it's the revelation of Jesus Christ

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and we find that as we look at these few verses

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
of scripture that yes, the Trinity is in view

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.519
and I'm thankful for the truth

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.040
and the teaching of the Trinity.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.959
However, we see this portrait, if you will,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.279
of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.760
and we begin to see some things with regard to who he is

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.880
and we get our eyes on who he is,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.640
we find that he is eternal.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.019
The Bible says here in verse number four

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:06.200
and again in verse number eight

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.160
and really verse number four is referencing the Father

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.700
if you're going to track the Trinity aspect

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.459
of what's being spoken of here

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.420
and verse four is speaking of the Father

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.959
and it says, from him which is and which was

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.920
and which is to come.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.220
We find though that in verse number eight,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.380
when it's speaking about Jesus,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.579
he says, I am Alpha and Omega,

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:31.859
the beginning and the ending, sayeth the Lord,

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:36.859
which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.299
I'm thankful that our God is eternal.

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:43.140
I'm thankful that he is, he was and he is to come.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.299
I'm thankful this evening that John, of course,

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:50.100
as he's writing, as the human penman writing this book,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.140
he was extremely familiar with the eternality

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.420
of Jesus Christ.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.980
In John chapter number one, we're reminded

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.299
of what John penned in the Gospel of John.

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:01.700
In John chapter number one,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.380
we know that the Bible says in the beginning

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.619
was the Word and the Word was with God

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.459
and the Word was God.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:09.820
He tells us in verse number 14

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.820
that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.459
But I want you to notice specifically

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:17.779
that in verse number 15, John the Baptist is speaking

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.980
and it says that John bear witness of him

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.940
and cried saying, here's what John the Baptist said,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.200
this was he of whom I spake, speaking of Jesus,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.019
who that cometh after me is preferred before me, why?

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:33.059
For he was before me.

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:35.299
Now, if you understand the scriptures,

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:39.260
you understand that John the Baptist is older physically.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.640
He was born first and then Jesus was born.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.880
But John the Baptist is able to say in verse number 15

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.779
that he was before me, why?

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.839
Because he's eternal.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:53.040
We find that in verse number 30 of John chapter number one,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.820
this reference is made again.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.239
This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:01.720
which is preferred before me, for he was before me.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.859
But then I want you to notice in John 17

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.820
John is recording this prayer of the Lord in John 17.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:13.260
No doubt there are times in which people reference

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.579
this phraseology, the Lord's Prayer,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.420
and they really are referencing the model prayer.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.579
When the disciple said, Lord, teach us to pray

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:22.660
and Jesus said, here's how you pray.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.859
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:28.260
That's the model prayer.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.579
That's not the Lord's Prayer.

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:32.020
Really, John 17 is the Lord's Prayer.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.219
We find that in John 17, Jesus knowing

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.700
that his hour was come and he's praying.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.780
And it says in verse number one, it says,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.299
these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.020
And he said, Father, the hour has come.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.859
Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee.

00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:51.340
Look at verse number five with me, if you will.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.419
It says this, and now, O Father, glorify thou me

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:59.419
with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.979
before the world was.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.020
So as we begin looking at the book of Revelation

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.380
and we're seeing the revelation of Jesus Christ

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.820
and we find that we're to recognize his person

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.859
and understand who he is, he reveals to us

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:20.260
the eternality of himself, the fact that he has

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.059
no beginning and no ending.

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:25.340
He says in verse eight, I am Alpha and Omega.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.900
He says, I am he that was and is and is to come.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.820
And what a joy.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.940
I want you to notice number two,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.260
when you consider recognizing his person,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.859
I want you to notice that he's faithful.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:38.140
He's faithful.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.179
Look at verse number five.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.859
The Bible says I'm from Jesus Christ,

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:44.780
who is the faithful witness.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.580
Let me say this just very briefly

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.340
as a interruption in thought.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.619
If you look at the end of verse number four

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:51.460
and from the seven spirits which are before his throne,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.700
that's where you see the Holy Spirit reference.

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:56.380
As I mentioned, the Trinity is in view.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.539
When we begin to think about verse number five

00:09:58.539 --> 00:09:59.940
and Jesus is referred to.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.980
being the faithful witness.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.100
I'm thankful that Paul declares it this way

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.200
in 1 Corinthians 1 and verse number nine

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.780
by simply saying God is faithful.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.340
I'm thankful for Paul as he's writing to the church

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.580
in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 24.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.660
He says faithful is he that calleth you

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.880
who also will do it.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.460
I'm thankful this evening that our God is faithful.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.580
One of the songs that we sang on Friday evening

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.500
at the memorial service for Alexis' mom,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.980
Ms. Susan was Great is Thy Faithfulness.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.980
And I know that every time we kind of go around

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.280
and have opportunity for favorites

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.700
and we have on Mother's Day the ladies get to pick a song

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.960
and on Father's Day the men get to pick a song

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.860
and then on our prayer, praise and pie

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.260
we'll sing a whole lot of songs

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.420
and every once in a while

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.940
we'll have other times of favorites

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.700
and it just seems to me that almost every single time

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.100
Great is Thy Faithfulness is one of the songs

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.540
that is requested by someone from our congregation.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.380
Why?

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.280
Because our God is faithful.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.660
Our God is faithful and he is true.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.520
We find that in Revelation 19 and verse number 11,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.420
notice with me the way that this is articulated here.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.540
This is when Christ comes back to earth

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.139
and we'll reference this in just a few moments again.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:20.420
But it says in verse number 11 of Revelation 19,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.459
and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:25.660
and he that sat upon him was called what?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.459
Faithful and true and in righteousness

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:32.620
he doth judge and make war.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.420
I'm so thankful that our God is faithful.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.100
He's trustworthy, he's dependable,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.459
he's never failed, he never will.

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:41.660
I'm thankful this evening that his faithfulness

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.800
is not dependent on my faithfulness.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.400
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.240
You know why?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.340
There've been times that we have, I have failed the Lord

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.180
but I'm thankful that he never fails.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.139
He's faithful, he's faithful.

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:57.420
And here in verse number five it says

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.060
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.900
We find also as we consider his person this evening

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.139
that in verse number eight we are revealed

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:09.619
that he says at the end of the verse

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:11.940
that he is the almighty.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.160
I want you to think about the name

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.220
that he ascribes to himself here

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.740
at the end of verse number eight.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.979
He says that I am Alpha and Omega.

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:22.059
He's the beginning and the ending.

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:23.979
He says which is and which was

00:12:23.979 --> 00:12:26.419
and which is to come the almighty.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:31.339
Omnipotent, ruler of everything.

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:33.580
That's what it means, that's what it means.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.540
I'm reminded of the truth in Genesis chapter 17

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.419
when Abram has a visit from the Lord

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.740
and we find that God reveals himself to Abraham

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.619
as being El Shaddai is the Hebrew word, the name of God

00:12:47.619 --> 00:12:50.839
and it means that he is the almighty one.

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:53.320
I'm thankful that our God is the almighty God.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.000
He has all power.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.419
There is nothing that's outside of his control.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.520
We spoke of that some this morning

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.800
at the end of the message

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.639
and we find here again as we begin to think

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:07.119
about the people that are being written to originally

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.960
but then we understand that throughout church history

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.880
that as God has chosen to providentially preserve this book

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.119
and to allow us tonight to have the book of Revelation

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:19.260
that we need to get our eyes on Jesus

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.180
and we need to see who he is.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.500
We need to understand that our God is eternal,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.300
that he is outside of time,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.940
that he knows the end from the beginning,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.260
that he is faithful,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.779
that he always does what he says he will do.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.279
We can trust him.

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.419
I made this statement a few times this morning.

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.380
We are either gonna believe God or we're not.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.779
We ought to believe him, he's faithful

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:48.040
and then we see that he is almighty.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.760
Aren't you thankful that you know who he is?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.639
I mean in just a few verses of scripture

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:56.440
all of a sudden if our attention is drawn to Jesus

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.839
and recognizing his person,

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:00.800
we're reminded about that peace

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.680
that he spoke of in verse number four

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.779
and we're reminded of the fact

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:07.760
that really it's gracious of God to reveal his person to us.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.960
I'm thankful this evening

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.839
that I don't have to try to figure out God on my own.

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:12.880
I'm thankful this evening

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.680
that I don't have to rely on my own resources.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.760
I don't have to go and try to figure out

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.279
who God is, God has given me a book

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:25.480
and in this precious book he has told me who he is.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.279
There's a lot of people that don't know who God is

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.959
because they're trying to define God outside of the Bible.

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.360
We find that here this evening when we see him exalted,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.380
when we get our eyes on Jesus,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.640
we remember his person,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.640
all of a sudden we're focused on who he is

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:46.360
and our attention is not so much on the circumstances

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.799
and the difficulties in which we're facing.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:51.700
We see number one this evening, recognize his person,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.700
number two, remember his passion.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.619
In verses five and six,

00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:59.980
we find that the Lord gives us truth

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.880
with regard to his passion, his work.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.000
In verse number five,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.720
his death and resurrection are clearly seen

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.679
and in verse number five the Bible says,

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.640
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.839
notice in the first begotten of the dead

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.320
and the prince of the kings of the earth,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.000
we find that as we look here

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.799
and see that the Bible continues in verse five

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:21.640
and says unto him that loved us

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.519
and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.320
So we find that in verse number five

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.679
that the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:34.200
are in clear view and we must remember that.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.040
We must remember what he did for us.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.080
We must understand this evening that he rose from the dead,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.440
conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.959
He is alive forevermore.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
He makes that declaration later

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.440
at the end of chapter number one

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.940
and I'm so thankful that I serve a risen savior.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.779
I'm so thankful.

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:54.179
Listen, we're all gonna face death

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:57.760
and we have placed our faith in the one

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.320
who has conquered death.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.760
And the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter number two

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.279
that we no longer have to have the fear of death.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.119
Why?

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:10.720
Because our God has conquered death.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.739
Oh death, where is thy sting?

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:14.720
Oh grave, where is thy victory?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.540
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.980
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.360
First Corinthians 15, you read the whole chapter.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.260
I mean, you see the resurrection in that chapter

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.239
like you see it nowhere else in the Bible

00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:30.779
in one condensed area and what a joy this evening to know.

00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:32.660
But look at the text here.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.980
It says in verse number five at the end,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.040
unto him that loved us.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.100
You know why he went to the cross?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.399
Because he loved us.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.640
Because he loved us.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.260
The Bible says in John three in verse 16,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.940
a verse that many of us are familiar with.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.339
In fact, it's John again that penned those words

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.779
that Jesus spoke to Nicodemus.

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:57.940
Nicodemus comes to Jesus and he says,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.100
we know that you're a ruler, a teacher,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.580
that you have done these things

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.739
and I mean, they're convinced of it

00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:09.660
and Jesus speaks to him about the need of being born again.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.540
And then we go through the text of scripture

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.019
and we come to verse 16, a verse that is so familiar,

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:19.860
so precious, for God so loved the world

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:23.820
that he gave his only begotten son,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.860
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.660
but have everlasting life.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.619
Aren't you thankful for that verse of scripture?

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:35.260
For God so loved the world.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
We find that in John three in verse 16,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.739
it tells us that precious truth here

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:42.260
in Revelation one in verse five,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.540
it says unto him that loved us.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.820
We're reminded that in John 13 in verse number one,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.260
at the end of the text that Jesus will speak

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.040
about loving one another as he loved them.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.619
But he says in John 13 in verse number one,

00:17:55.619 --> 00:17:57.940
it says this, having loved his own,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.220
which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.260
I'm thankful tonight that there's nothing

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.140
that can separate me from the love of God.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.019
I'm thankful for that.

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:10.940
It caused us to rejoice in that.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.059
He loved us, he continues to love us.

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:15.899
Notice in first John, again, as we reference

00:18:15.899 --> 00:18:19.299
various passages that God used the apostle John

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:23.500
to pin with the similar subject in first John three

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.380
in verse number 16, by the way,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.220
it's an interesting study to see John 316

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.100
next to first John 316, for the Bible says

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.099
in first John 316, hereby perceive we the love of God.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.960
How is it that we perceive the love of God?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.340
Because he laid down his life for us

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.580
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.020
He laid down his life for us.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.099
John talks about in John chapter number 10,

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:51.659
Jesus says I am the good shepherd.

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:53.000
And he says that the good shepherd,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.700
what does the good shepherd do?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.460
He gives his life for the sheep.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.979
See, no one's gonna take it from him.

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:03.739
In fact, even while he was on the cross of Calvary,

00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:05.739
you understand that the Bible says

00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:08.320
that he gave up the ghost.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.340
He gave up the ghost.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.900
He laid his life down as a sacrifice,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.580
as the sacrifice that was required

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.720
to pay for my sin and your sin and the sin of the world.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.179
No man takes it from him.

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:24.419
He says in John 10 that he not only

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:25.619
is gonna lay his life down,

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:27.580
but he's gonna take it up again.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.340
He speaks of the resurrection right there

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.020
in the same passage of scripture.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.820
And what a joy to know that he did.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.979
Listen, the disciples,

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:36.859
if you read through the gospel accounts

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.179
after the announcement of the resurrection,

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.500
there's all kinds of confusion.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.700
They run and they're troubled

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.020
and they don't know what's going on.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.679
And then they remember,

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:49.580
oh, this is what Jesus was telling us about.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.059
And they remembered.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.659
Listen, this evening,

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:57.419
we have to be reminded of the truth that God loved us.

00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:00.020
And his love is what sent him to the cross of,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.500
Calvary, he gave up the ghost,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.460
he willingly laid down his life.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.420
Remember, Pilate was so confused

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.220
when they said that he was dead already,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.740
typically because of the circumstances

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.100
at that particular time,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.500
and what they did to the thieves

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.820
is they broke the legs so that they would die quickly.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.460
They tried to make crucifixion

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.340
as long as they possibly could

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.520
to make it as torturous,

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.580
and also to cause others to be walking a straighter line

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.580
because they don't want to end up in that same position.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.780
And we find that Pilate said he's dead already,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.340
yeah, but the Psalms said that no bones would be broken.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.500
The Bible's awesome.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.620
And we find that 1 John 4 and verse number 10,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.640
the Bible says, herein is love,

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.680
not that we love God, but that he loved us

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.680
and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.900
This evening, when we begin to remember his passion,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.420
we recognize his person, but we remember his passion,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.660
we remember all that he suffered there at Calvary,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.140
all that he suffered leading up to Calvary,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.860
all that he endured on that cross,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.780
and we understand it's because he loved us.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.820
It's because he loved us.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.020
But then the Bible says this in Revelation 1

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.420
and verse number five,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.140
not only unto him that loved us,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.140
but it says, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.060
This reveals to us the cleansing work of Calvary,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.900
the fact that we needed to have that blood.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.820
We sang this evening about the blood

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.100
and what a great song to start our service this evening,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.580
singing about the blood.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.940
And we find that this evening,

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.620
the truth that I prayed that without the shedding of blood,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.580
there's no remission, we have forgiveness,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.580
redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.980
And he washed us from our sins in his own blood.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.540
You know, the reality is that all of us have sinned

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.020
and all of us must have the blood applied.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.700
We sing the song, we didn't sing it this evening,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.980
we sing the song, are you washed in the blood?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.820
You know it?

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.940
Are you washed in the blood?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.700
It asks questions in the soul, cleansing blood of the lamb.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.260
And every time we sing that song,

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.000
at that point right there, I say this, yes, I am.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.020
You say, why do you say that?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.260
Because I want to, amen.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.580
Because the spirit led me to, amen.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.060
Because I am saved by the blood of the lamb.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.220
And when it says, are you washed in the blood

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.340
and the soul cleansing blood of the lamb?

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.000
I say, yes, I am.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.240
I am saved by the blood of Christ.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.180
By the way, there's no other way to be saved, amen.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.800
It's the only way to be saved.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.420
Are your garments spotless?

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.500
Are they white as snow?

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.700
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.660
It's a great song.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.380
And we find here that as the book of Revelation

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.340
is being given to us in these introductory statements

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.780
before the messages even come to the churches in Asia

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.300
that we'll read and we'll study the details of them,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.880
we find that he's telling us that these messages,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.140
that these letters are coming from God

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.100
and we must get our attention on him.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.460
We must get our eyes on our Lord

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.000
and we must understand that he is eternal,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.800
that he is almighty, that he is faithful.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.960
We must understand that he loved us

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.280
and that he washed us, he cleansed us.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.360
And then we see in verse number six,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.760
the beginning of the verse, notice what he did.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.960
After we got saved, it says that he hath made us kings

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.360
and priests unto God and his father.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.960
You know, that's a privileged position that he gave us.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.800
You know, it's a joy to be said that I'm a child of God.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.480
I'm a child of the king, amen, we sing the song.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.560
And the reality is that I've been adopted, hallelujah.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.600
I'm a child of the king.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.920
And we find this evening the truth

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.480
that I'm joint heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.900
that he calls me his son.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.240
Remember John one in verse number 11,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.500
he came to his own, but his own received him not.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.520
But verse number 12, but as many as received him

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.100
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.760
even to them that believe on his name.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.360
It's a joy.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.160
I think about the Old Testament.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.400
I believe it's 2 Samuel chapter nine, Mephibosheth.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.800
And Mephibosheth was the son of Jonathan

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.400
and Mephibosheth was crippled

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.760
and Mephibosheth could do nothing for himself.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.240
But David the king, he wanted to show kindness

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.000
to the house of Saul, that's what the Bible says.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.080
He wanted to show kindness to the house of Saul.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.440
And he said, is there any yet alive?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.080
And someone told him, there's this one Mephibosheth,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.280
the son of Jonathan down in Lodabar.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.320
He says, call for him.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.840
And Mephibosheth is brought there

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.080
because he's crippled and he comes there

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.860
and he's concerned.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.360
I believe that he thought,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.760
I believe that he believed he was gonna be killed

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.040
because that was so common in the age,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.040
the era in which those events took place.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.040
You know what David says?

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.080
I'm gonna make you as one of the king's sons.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.600
You're gonna sit at my table.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.440
I'm gonna give you all the provision.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.600
He gave him land.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.820
And you say, why would he give him land?

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.840
The man is crippled.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.080
Well, he gave him servants to go with the land

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.160
because Mephibosheth himself couldn't take care of the land

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.120
so he gave him all the provision.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.680
And he said, you're gonna sit at my table

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.200
as one of the king's sons.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.840
Man, it's awesome to read that passage of scripture.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.180
And what a great picture it is

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.380
that I have been made a child of God.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.560
He says specifically here in verse six,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.320
that he hath made us, notice kings and priests,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.240
begin to understand the fact that this gives us

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.740
the opportunity and the privilege to be able to serve him.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.440
You think about that truth of the priesthood of the believer

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.940
in 1 Peter chapter two,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.160
just a few pages back in your Bible,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.140
we notice in this portion of scripture,

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.560
the truth of the priesthood of the believer.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.040
The Bible says in verse number nine

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.040
in 1 Peter chapter two,

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.000
but ye are a chosen generation,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.440
a royal priesthood and holy nation,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.640
a peculiar people that you should show forth

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.960
the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.640
into his marvelous light,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.320
which in time past were not a people,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.080
but are now the people of God,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.600
which had not obtained mercy,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.640
but now have obtained mercy.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.880
Aren't you thankful?

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.840
He's made us a priest.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.780
You know that we can serve him.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.320
We can bring him the offerings.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.240
We can enter into his presence.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.740
Hebrews 13 in verse 15 talks about bringing continually

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.300
the sacrifice of the praise of our lips

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.940
and what a joy to know that we can serve him

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.940
because of how he's made us a king and a priest.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.060
We find that we can serve him now,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.980
but we also see the truth here that is further developed

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.060
as we go through the book of Revelation

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.060
that will serve him during the millennial reign

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.600
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.220
Jesus is literally gonna reign for a thousand years.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.540
And by the way, someone asked a great question this morning.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.540
They said, I know that you mentioned

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.020
that Jesus is gonna reign for a thousand years,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.620
but can you help me understand that?

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.580
Because God said that a thousand years is a day

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.100
and a day is a thousand years.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.460
Is it really a thousand years?

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.500
And I said, yes, it is.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500
And here's why.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.820
He's speaking to us from our perspective of time,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.820
not his perspective of time.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.440
Isaiah talks about the one that dies at a hundred

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.260
is gonna die like a child.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.900
And so obviously a thousand literal years

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.540
as we would calculate time.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.260
And so we find that he's gonna rule and reign,

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.900
but he says that he's made us kings and priests

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.860
and we're gonna rule and reign with him.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.540
It's further developed as we get into chapter 20

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.600
of the book of Revelation in verses one through six.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.900
And we'll get there in about five years, I guess,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.300
according to brother Hummel,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.900
but we'll get there and we'll study and we'll see

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.500
what that looks like in the millennial reign of Christ.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.900
But what a joy to be able to serve him today,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.700
to have that position.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.620
See, that's what he did for us.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.380
I notice in first Peter chapter two in verse number 10,

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.700
I read it just a moment ago,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.620
but I noticed where the scripture said,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.580
which in time past were not a people,

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.840
but are now the people of God.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.540
I hope that just that simple thought

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.980
from that portion of verse number 10

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.200
encourages you tonight.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.300
Because before salvation, we were not a people.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.220
We were lost on our way to a Christless eternity.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.660
But thankfully, the Lord Jesus Christ took our place.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.260
We need to remember the work that he did,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.420
remember his passion.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.700
Number three, recall his promise.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.080
In verse number seven, notice with me,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.920
the Bible says this,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.920
"'Behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:00.540
"'and they also which pierced him

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.880
"'in all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.900
"'Even so, amen.'"

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.619
We find here in verse number seven,

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:11.460
the Bible says, "'Behold, he cometh.'"

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.300
It tells us that every eye shall see him.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.820
It also tells us they which pierced him would see him.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.820
That's speaking about the Jews or Israel as a nation.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.739
And we find that here in verse number seven,

00:29:25.739 --> 00:29:28.140
it's important that we understand this evening

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.420
that the obvious reference to Christ's return here

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.220
is when he returns all the way to the earth

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.760
at the end of the tribulation.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.640
Let me very quickly try to help us understand this idea

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.480
or the teaching, the biblical truth

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.400
with regard to the return of Christ.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.360
There's really two aspects to the return of Christ.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.880
He's going to return in the air,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.520
according to 1 Thessalonians chapter number four.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.280
And when he returns in the air,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.160
the Bible says that we which are alive,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.040
the dead in Christ shall rise first,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.280
then we which are alive.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.740
and remains shall be caught up together with him,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.540
and we're gonna meet him in the air,

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.220
and we're gonna be with him forever.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.220
He's not gonna come all the way to earth

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.300
at that first time, he's just gonna come in the air.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.900
And by the way, it seems clear,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.340
we'll look at a few verses here in just a moment,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.340
that not every eye is gonna see him.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.860
In fact, 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.440
and verse number two says that he's coming

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.360
like a thief in the night.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.240
The Bible says in a moment, the twinkling of an eye,

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:33.140
which is faster than you can blink, 1 Corinthians 15,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.240
that's how he's gonna return at that point.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.240
But then, in that event, which we refer to as the rapture,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.940
why don't we use the word rapture?

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.420
People come and say, well, the rapture's

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.860
not even in the Bible, that's because

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.420
they're looking for the word rapture.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.700
Do you know that the word dinosaur

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.820
is not in the Bible either?

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.220
Does that mean there are no dinosaurs?

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.220
I read something this week that said,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.860
science proves the Bible wrong,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.500
because dinosaurs aren't in the Bible.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.680
Come on, man, the word dinosaur didn't even

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.800
come into existence until the 19th century.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.480
How's the word gonna be in the Bible

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.120
if it didn't even exist?

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.480
Right, and they're like, well,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.280
let's not talk about the facts.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.180
But the reality is that, listen,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.200
the fact that the word rapture is not there

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.640
doesn't mean there's not a rapture,

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.840
because the word caught up means rapture.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.040
If you study the Greek and you understand it,

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.880
that's what it means, it means to be caught up,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.080
to be raptured, all right?

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.140
We find here that that's what's going to start

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.620
that seven-year period of time

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.660
that we refer to as the tribulation,

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.860
and that will be taking place here on earth.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.340
Remember I mentioned to you last week

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.920
that when you study the book of Revelation,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.500
there'll be scenes in heaven and scenes on earth,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.320
and they sometimes just go back and forth,

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.860
these scenes that we find throughout the book of Revelation,

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.700
and so we find that really, to begin chapter number four

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.780
of the book of Revelation is where we see

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.940
the rapture of the church really taking place,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.460
and John being escorted into heaven.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.080
You see in chapters two and three

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.560
the references of the letters to the church.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.520
After that point, no longer do you see

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.200
any reference to the church until chapter 19,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.640
and in chapter 19, the reference that you see

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.080
with the church is the saints,

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.780
and we're coming back with him, okay?

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.520
So when we look at this and we see this reference

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.520
in Revelation one and verse number seven,

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.540
and behold, he cometh with clouds,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.220
and every eye shall see him,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.020
this is referring not to the rapture,

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.700
but to the end of the tribulation

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.260
when he returns all the way to earth,

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.580
and he's gonna literally set his foot down,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.340
and we see, we're gonna look at Zechariah here

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.340
in just a moment, and we find that this event

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.380
is fully developed or more fully explained

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.380
as we get to the book of Revelation in the 19th chapter.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.260
We find that we read verse number 11,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.120
and then you continue from there, and you see that,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.480
but look back at the book of Zechariah, if you will,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.880
very quickly, I wanna look at two verses of scripture

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.320
in the book of Zechariah.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.840
The easiest way to find Zechariah is to find Matthew

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.360
and then go backwards to Malachi

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.600
and backwards again to Zechariah, all right?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.360
So if you're struggling, that's the easiest way to find it,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.760
at least the easiest way I have learned to find it.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.320
Zechariah chapter number 12, look at verse number 10.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.760
The Bible says, and I will pour upon the house of David

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.820
and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.580
the spirit of grace and of supplication,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.220
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.020
and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.580
for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.740
as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.060
Now, here's where we see about they're gonna look upon him

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.140
who they pierced, and we see that in Revelation 1

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.860
in verse number seven, but now skip over to chapter 14,

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.620
if you will, and look at verse number four.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.260
The Bible says this, and his feet shall stand in that day

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.800
upon the Mount of Olives.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.280
How many have ever stood on the Mount of Olives?

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.720
All right, some of you stood there.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.680
I remember standing on the Mount of Olives,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.760
and I remember as I stood there, we sat up,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.400
there's a little place where you can sit up there

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.820
and oversee, and I mean, you can, it's amazing

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.400
as you look over the valley and you see the Temple Mount

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.220
and all that you see, and at the bottom,

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.740
between the Temple Mount and the valley,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.480
you see the Garden of Gethsemane, I mean, it's amazing.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.880
It's a treacherous walk down that walkway there,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.060
very, very, very steep, but the reality is that

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.720
when I stood there, you know what I thought?

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.840
One day, Jesus is coming back, and he's gonna put his foot

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.760
right here on the Mount of Olives.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.240
It's what the Bible says, and it says in verse number four,

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.880
which is before Jerusalem on the east,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.680
and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.000
toward the east and toward the west.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.400
It's gonna literally split it open.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.600
The Bible says, and there shall be a very great valley,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.800
and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.000
and half of it toward the south.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.220
So I stood on the Mount of Olives, and I thought about this.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.280
In fact, we read the passage of Scripture.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.420
It's gonna happen, but that's gonna happen

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.300
in Revelation 19, is the timing in the book of Revelation.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.420
So here in Revelation one, when here John is speaking

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.580
about the fact that the Lord cometh,

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.180
he's speaking specifically about Revelation 19

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.020
when he comes at the end of the tribulation,

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.000
but we must rejoice and recall the promise that he gave,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.220
even as John is mindful in John 14,

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.000
as he had the privilege of writing those words,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.460
let not your heart be troubled.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.320
If you believe in God, believe also in me.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.080
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.720
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.000
And then he says this, I go to prepare a place for you,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.020
and if I go and prepare a place, I'll come again

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.440
and receive you unto myself,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.560
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.320
And he said, I come again.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.160
I will come again.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.840
Remember, he's the faithful witness, right?

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.560
Verse number five is the faithful witness.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.880
He said, I will come again.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.260
John says this in 1 John chapter number two.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.600
We mentioned John 14 and 1 John chapter two

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.400
in verse number 28, the Bible says,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.880
and now little children abide in him

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.840
that when he shall appear, not if he shall appear,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.080
but when he shall appear, he's coming.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.740
We may have confidence and not be ashamed

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.480
before him that is coming.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.460
If it tells us this, then we know that it is possible

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.680
that some could be ashamed of him that is appearing.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.180
Verse 29, if you know that he is righteous,

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.080
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.180
is born of him, chapter three and verse one.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.240
Behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.320
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.420
Really, that goes right back to verse number six

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.060
and five in Revelation that he loved us

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.120
and washed us from our sins in his own blood.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.700
Therefore, the world knoweth us not

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.720
because it knew him not.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.540
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.980
And it does not yet appear what we shall be,

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.180
but we know that again, when he shall appear,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:45.180
we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.440
And every man that hath this hope in him

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.940
purifies himself even as he is pure.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
In Acts one, so John had the privilege of hearing Jesus say

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.040
in John 14 and then recording,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.520
let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.760
And that verse, those verses that I quoted for you

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.640
a moment ago, he had the privilege of recording for us

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.960
first John 2, 28 down through chapter three

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.260
in verse number three about the return.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.340
But then John had the privilege of standing

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.200
in Acts chapter number one when he watched Jesus ascend

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.220
back up into heaven.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.900
And as John was part of that group that stood there

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.580
as Jesus ascended back up into heaven,

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.580
he heard the angel say, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.340
This same Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.360
shall so come in like manner.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.500
What a joy, what a joy.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.840
Listen, we need to recall this promise.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.100
We don't know when he's coming, but we know that he is.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.260
I said this last week, imminent and immediate

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.140
are not the same thing.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.100
The reality is that when God gives us the teaching

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.860
in his word of the imminent return of Christ,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.220
it really is a precious, God has all wisdom, all right?

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.820
And sometimes he just lets us get a little bit

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.060
of his wisdom, but he has all wisdom.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.060
And with having all wisdom, he knew that he could give

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200
this teaching of the imminent return of Christ

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.920
and every generation of believer would live,

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.520
understanding that it could happen in their time.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.380
It's amazing.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.540
Jesus didn't give us the day.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.020
The disciples were asking in Acts chapter one,

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.200
he said, it's not for you to know.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.520
We just gotta be busy about the work

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.840
that he's given us to do.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.400
And so this evening, what's the result?

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.260
When we get our eyes on Jesus, we take the thought

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.600
of this message tonight, get your eyes on Jesus.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.720
When we recognize this person, when we remember his passion,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.140
when we recall his promise, when we're focused upon Jesus,

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.040
what is it that will be the result?

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.280
Well, look at the end of verse number six.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.280
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.400
Listen, when you get your eyes on Jesus,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.500
you know what you start doing?

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.340
You start worshiping him.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.520
You start praising him.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.260
Why?

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.320
Because you're seeing him for who he is.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.040
You're getting your eyes on Jesus.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.020
You're not so focused on all the circumstances of life,

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.520
all the things going on around us.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.360
Can I tell you this?

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.320
Even there's a lot of things pulling for our attention.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.480
A lot of voices in the world,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.360
a lot of things that are trying to get us distracted.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.440
I preached a few weeks ago on Sunday morning

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.260
about a good soldier not being distracted.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.580
And here we find that if we get our eyes on Jesus,

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.640
we can rejoice in knowing who he is,

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.720
what he has done for us, and what he is still going to do.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.300
He's coming back for us.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.240
Someone said this to me this morning.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.320
They said, I don't know a whole lot of things,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.160
but one thing that I do know

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.960
is that whether I have to live through some difficulties

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.960
and I die a martyr, or if I just live in peace and freedom

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.880
and I just die of old age,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:06.280
I know is I'm going to see Jesus. Hallelujah. I understand, I'd rather die just of old age

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.360
and not have to go through all the tribulation and all the difficulty, but the Bible says

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.380
that we'll face persecution, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.460
persecution. I really think tonight that we need to be prepared for it. I'm going to preach

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.160
a message in just a couple of Sunday mornings of preparing for persecution. 1 John chapter,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.520
or excuse me, 2 Timothy chapter number 3. You say, you really think it's going to happen?

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.760
I don't know, because I'm not a prophet in that sense of foretelling, but I can foretell

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.520
what the Bible says, and the reality is we better be prepared for it. Amen? When we look

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:46.320
at these people that we're facing under Domitian's rule, terrible, terrible times, grace, peace,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:54.100
why? Because we get our eyes on Jesus. And we recall, we recall His promise, that last

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.660
point that we dealt with, we remember His passion, that what He did for us, and then

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.940
we recognize His person. And we just see how lovely and how wonderful He is. And what will

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:12.500
happen is we'll begin rejoicing to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.980
Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.060
tonight. We thank You for the truth of it. I pray, Lord, that You would help us to get

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.180
our eyes on Jesus. Lord, we understand that we're living in a difficult time. We have

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.700
all sorts of things going on around us. And Lord, we pray that You would just work in

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.700
our hearts and lives, that You would help us, Lord, to take the truth of this short

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.980
portion of Scripture, Lord, that we'd get our eyes on You. Move and work in this time

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.540
of invitation as only You can, and we'll give You the glory for it. In Christ's name, we

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.980
pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.260
quietly on the piano.
