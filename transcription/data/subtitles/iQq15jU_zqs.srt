1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
written 39, and it's interesting that we would sing that song that we just sang

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,079
about our all being on the altar, and I hope when you sing, what a privilege it

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:18,840
is to sing, but the ministry of music, the place that music has in worship, and as

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,399
we sing songs, it's not just some kind of filler, and it's an opportunity to

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,920
worship the Lord and how the the Spirit of God speaks to our hearts through the

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,720
words of these wonderful hymns, and I'm so thankful for the old hymns of the

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,040
faith, and praise the Lord for it. Psalm 139, be looking at verses 23 and 24 this

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,439
evening. I intend that the message will be a little shorter this evening, and

9
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:50,119
we'll spend an extended amount of time in prayer this evening, and Psalm 139, I

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,200
want to draw your attention to these two verses of Scripture. The Bible says,

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,319
Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts, and see if

12
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:08,440
there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. Many of us are

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,879
familiar with this text of Scripture. In fact, we often sing the song that is

14
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:20,160
titled, Cleanse Me, and it's interesting, that song that is in our hymnal, number

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,879
57, J. Edwin Orr penned the words of that hymn in 1936, and his testimony is that

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,879
he penned those words during an intense movement of the Holy Spirit at the

17
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:37,599
Easter Revival Convention in New Zealand. He goes on to say, for some time it was

18
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,360
in 1936 that the words to that song were penned, he said, for some time prior to

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,120
this Easter campaign, an attitude of unusual expectancy had been prevalent

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,879
among those people. Prayer meetings spread throughout the city with much

21
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,959
fervency, and intercession led to widespread confession and reconciliation

22
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,839
among the believers. Great numbers of unconverted students professed faith in

23
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:07,720
Christ. The next night was given over to testimony with singing such as one

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,039
expects in heaven. The revival news soon spread throughout all of New Zealand. Dr.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,240
Orr reports that as he was leaving New Zealand, four Aborigine girls approached

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,320
and they sang a beautiful song for him. It was a Morai song of farewell, and he

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,679
heard the tune of that particular song and loved the tune, and he was so

28
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:33,559
impressed with the beauty of this Polynesian melody that soon afterward he

29
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:38,600
wrote new verses to the tune on the back of an envelope. The text was based on the

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,960
familiar words of Scripture that we just read this evening. Search me, O God,

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,440
and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,119
way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. If you're taking notes and

33
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,880
you'd like a title this evening, I've simply entitled the message, Search Me, O

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,080
God. As we look at this and dig right in this evening, I want you to notice with

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,679
me that the psalm is a psalm that is ascribed to David, and so the sweet

36
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:14,320
psalmist of Israel has been used of the Lord to write this psalm, and we see that

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,600
as we note the the verses that end this psalm, I believe, number one this evening,

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,119
that it was a personal plea. I'm impressed by the personal nature of what

39
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:30,440
we find here in the text of Scripture, and it's important for us to understand

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,119
the personal nature of these verses of Scripture, in that we are aware of the

41
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:41,600
importance of us also having a personal desire, such as what is expressed by

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,399
David here in this prayer. We notice the use of pronouns. In fact, in two

43
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:53,960
verses of Scripture, he uses the word me four times. He uses the word me four times.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:02,440
That personal nature of this prayer, this plea, he says, search me, O God, and

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,199
know my heart. We see the personal nature of it, and this evening, as we think about

46
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,399
the aspect of these familiar words of Scripture, and we think about the

47
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:20,480
prayer of the psalmist, and the understanding of the personal nature of

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,359
what we're dealing with this evening, I would like, as I've approached the

49
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:28,640
passage, and as I would seek to share some thoughts with you this evening, that

50
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,559
we, too, would take a personal approach to the subject matter that is before us. In

51
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:37,480
just a short period of time, we were planning to have a revival meeting, and

52
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,920
what a joy to be able to have a special meeting on our calendar on an annual

53
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,760
basis. And obviously, this year, many things have been adjusted on the calendar,

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,440
and many things have been removed from the calendar, and we're not having the

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,359
evangelist that we intended to have that was originally scheduled, actually, a

56
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,440
couple of years ago. But the Lord knows, and the Lord's in control of those

57
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,519
things, and I'm looking forward to those that will be with us. And I find this

58
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:11,880
evening, this personal aspect of approaching and entering into church

59
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,839
services regularly, or even as we have special revival meetings, that we'd

60
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,440
understand that I'm desiring that God would work in my life, that God would

61
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,119
search me, that God would show me, that I understand that it's important if we

62
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:31,359
could figuratively, this evening, have in our minds this idea that we stand and we

63
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:36,920
draw a circle around ourselves and say, God, work within the circle. Work in my

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,480
life. Do something in my life. And we see the personal nature. He says, search me, O

65
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,000
God, and know my heart. We're familiar with Jeremiah 17, but I remind you what

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Jeremiah records for us here in this familiar passage of Scripture. In

67
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,359
Jeremiah 17, in verse number 9, the Bible says, the heart is deceitful above all

68
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:08,480
things, and desperately wicked. Who can know it? In verse number 10 of Jeremiah

69
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:16,880
17 says, I, the Lord, search the heart. I try the reins, even to give every man

70
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,559
according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. We understand

71
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:28,959
that the Bible teaches that the heart is deceitful. We understand this evening

72
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,880
many things with regard to deceit. We understand that the enemy of the

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,760
brethren is a deceiver, right? And we understand the nature of those that

74
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,720
would try to deceive us, but the reality is that at times in our lives we can be

75
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,200
deceived. We can deceive ourselves. Self-deception. We find here that the

76
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Lord answers the question when the verse ends, who can know it? I, the Lord,

77
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,519
search the heart. And that's what we see here, that the plea of the psalmist, the

78
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:11,200
plea of David, is search me, O God, and know my heart. Notice what he says, try me

79
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:21,440
and know my thoughts. And we understand this evening the importance of bringing

80
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,600
into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. We see that truth in

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
2nd Corinthians 10 and verse number 5, and Paul gives the admonition to those

82
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,040
that he's writing to in Philippi, there in Philippians 4 and verse number 8, with

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,239
regard to the things that were to think on. And he says, finally, brethren, what

84
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,920
sort of things are true, what sort of things are honest, what sort of things are just,

85
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,079
what sort of things are pure, what sort of things are lovely, what sort of things are

86
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,720
of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things.

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,959
Now, we understand this evening as we approach this passage of Scripture and

88
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,279
we take this familiar passage of Scripture, that the psalmist is taking

89
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,279
this personal approach. I remember, I don't know all the words to the song, but

90
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,519
there was a little chorus that we sang with kids years ago in a junior church,

91
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:16,519
children's church type of a setting. It's me, it's me, it's me, O Lord, standing in

92
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,839
the need of prayer. I think it goes something like, not my brother, not my

93
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,239
sister, but it's me, O Lord. And I think about that little chorus and that little

94
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,279
song that we'd sing, and I think about the words of the psalmist here in

95
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,440
understanding that David is saying, God, I'm interested in you searching my heart,

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm interested in you knowing my heart and trying me and knowing my thoughts.

97
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:50,400
See, there's a danger that we face in not really accepting the personal nature of

98
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,400
these particular verses of Scripture. What I mean by that is there are times

99
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,679
in which we think that we're really praying and really hoping that God works

100
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,400
in somebody else's heart and life, that God really shows them the error of their

101
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,760
ways. We get kind of concerned about that. The Pharisees, they were really good at

102
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,880
that, were they not? I'm going to read to you what the Pharisee says in Luke 18,

103
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,679
jot it down if you will, in Luke 18 verses 10 through 12. The Bible records

104
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,520
for us about two men that went up into the temple to pray. The Bible tells us

105
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,320
that the one was a Pharisee and the other was a publican. The Pharisee begins

106
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,200
to pray in verse number 11 of Luke 18, and it says, the Pharisee stood and prayed

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,520
thus with himself, God I thank thee that I am not as other men are. Extortioners,

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:56,119
unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes

109
00:09:56,119 --> 00:10:01,520
of all that I possess. The publican, according to verse number 13, sending afar

110
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,719
off would not lift up so much as his eyes into heaven, but smote upon his

111
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:13,320
breast saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. It says this in verse 14, I tell you

112
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,080
this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For

113
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,200
every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself

114
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,760
shall be exalted. I believe there's interesting insight to us in verse

115
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,119
number 14 with regard to the importance of humility. What is going to lead me?

116
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:38,239
What is it that led the psalmist David to say what he says in Psalm 139 verses

117
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:43,359
23 and 24, to say search me O God and know my heart, try me and know my

118
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,440
thoughts, that personal plea. What was it? I believe that there's a level of

119
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,799
humility, a level of humility. And there's a recognition of I'm desiring that God

120
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,919
works in my heart, in my life. We find that Peter, if you'll recall with me at

121
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,919
the end of the book of John, in chapter number 21 after they go fishing, and we

122
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,159
find that the Lord shows up on the shore and he says, have you caught

123
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,799
anything? Do you have any meat? And they say, no we've caught nothing. And Jesus tells

124
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,559
them to cast the net and they would find and they have a great host of multitude

125
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,400
of fish that they bring in. And Peter then after they come to the shore and

126
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,919
they come and dine and they enjoy fellowship with the Lord, the Lord Jesus

127
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,799
Christ begins to interact personally with Peter. Begins to ask him a series of

128
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,960
questions. Do you love me? And we recognize those truths that are there

129
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,799
and we find that the Lord then gives some instruction and revelation with

130
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,280
regard to the end of Peter's life and the death that he would die. And Jesus

131
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,039
says this, Peter follow me. You'll probably recall that John was there as

132
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,400
well. And Peter says to the Lord Jesus Christ after he hears those words, follow

133
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,000
me, in verse number 21 he says, well what about this guy? He says, Lord and what

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,799
shall this man do? What's he concerned about? He's concerned about John, right?

135
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:23,400
And Jesus says, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow

136
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,119
thou me. Really learn about that. Learn about some personal responsibility. One

137
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:34,400
day we're gonna stand before the Lord Jesus Christ. And you're not gonna stand,

138
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,559
you're gonna stand by yourself, amen? You're gonna give an account. And we find

139
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,799
the personal nature of this and the importance. The Bible tells us that

140
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,760
there in Corinth there was some problems that were going on. Part of, I mean

141
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,520
obviously there's a whole list of problems are going on in Corinth, but in

142
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,320
2nd Corinthians the Bible reveals to us that they were comparing themselves

143
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,320
among themselves. And the Bible says that this is not wise. See there's a danger in

144
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,960
us being able to look at other people and looking at how I'm maybe comparing

145
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,799
myself among ourselves, but the standard is not some other believer. The standard

146
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,080
is the Lord Jesus Christ and the Word of God. And so we find that the personal

147
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,000
nature of this plea is revealed to us in the use of the pronouns and the fact

148
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,559
that he says, search me, know my heart, try me, know my thoughts. And this evening

149
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,239
this is a prayer that we need to pray. This is a place in which we need to get

150
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:42,200
alone with the Lord and say, God we want you to search us, me personally. Yes, I

151
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,760
want God to work collectively, but I must be careful to understand the importance

152
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,599
of the personal nature of this plea from David here in Psalm 139 verses 23 and 24.

153
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,679
Notice I believe not only was it personal, I believe it was passionate. I believe

154
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:05,440
that David really desired for God to search him. I believe that David was

155
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,119
passionate in his prayer. We see many things about David. There are much that

156
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:13,039
we could discuss with regard to his life and we could go through a whole host of

157
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,559
things and see some passion in the way that he rejoiced, the way that he sought

158
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,679
the Lord. I believe here as he's praying, I believe that there's a level of

159
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,719
passion. It's interesting to me as you read the entirety of Psalm 139 that the

160
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:31,799
psalmist had an awareness of God's omniscience and omnipresence. Notice how

161
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,159
he begins the psalm in verse number one of Psalm 139. It says, O Lord, thou hast

162
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:44,760
searched me and known me. He begins the psalm with the acknowledgement of God's

163
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:51,960
omniscience, that God knows everything, but yet he concludes the psalm by saying,

164
00:14:51,960 --> 00:15:03,119
Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. Amen? But he starts

165
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:09,559
the psalm by saying, Thou hast searched me. In understanding, knowing, recognizing

166
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,200
the fact that our God is omniscient, you understand this evening that as we

167
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,400
consider the prayer of David at the end of the psalm, it was not only that he had

168
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,640
an awareness that God knew these things, but we see in this prayer, in these words,

169
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,520
that he desired for the Lord to search him and to know him and to try him and

170
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,039
to see if there be any wicked way in him. That desire on the part of the

171
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,919
psalmist to say, God, I want you to search me. See, it's one thing for us to

172
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:48,919
recognize that God knows everything. He does. When Adam and Eve were hiding in

173
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:55,200
the garden, did God know where they were? Of course he did. When David thought that

174
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,919
he did everything that he could within his power to cover his tracks, did God

175
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,440
know what he had committed? Surely he did. That's why he sends Nathan and says, Thou

176
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,000
art the man. Right? We can't hide anything from God. But there's something

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
interesting to me about the prayer of the psalmist here, is that the

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,479
knowledge of God knowing everything, but then the invitation to that all-knowing

179
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:31,080
God to come and search me. See, it's one thing for a child to know that their

180
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:36,679
parents have the ability to go in and to search the bedroom and to search under

181
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,440
the bed and in the closet and wherever they want to search to be able to find

182
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,239
whatever it is that they want to find, but it's another thing for the child to

183
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:52,039
say, I invite you in to look. Do you understand the difference? See, God knows

184
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,400
everything and He knows our hearts. He knows if there's wickedness in us. He

185
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,719
knows our thoughts, but yet we find that the psalmist is inviting God in. He's

186
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:09,560
desiring, I believe, with passion for God to do this work in his life. I think it's

187
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:16,719
very encouraging to see the perspective of David and also for us to understand

188
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:23,280
the importance this evening of having a similar heart attitude. How many times

189
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,760
throughout the Gospels do we read of the interactions of the Lord Jesus Christ

190
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,920
with those to whom he ministered, and yet Jesus would say that he knew their

191
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,560
thoughts, and they marveled. I mean, they didn't know. How does he know what we were

192
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,439
thinking? He knows your thoughts. He knows my thoughts, but it's a different thing

193
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:47,000
when we say, Lord, we want you to search us and we want you to know and try, and

194
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,260
that invitation that we extend, I believe that we only are going to extend that

195
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,300
invitation when we have that measure of humility. I believe that we'll only

196
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,819
extend that invitation when we have that process of self-examination. When we go

197
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:09,260
through the process of what we read of in 1 Corinthians 11 that we often read

198
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,300
and reference during the time of observing the Lord's Supper, and we

199
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,020
understand that it's a table of examination, but let a man examine

200
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:27,619
himself. We find that because the heart is deceitful, that we say, Lord, now we

201
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:34,939
want you to search me in case I have deceived myself. I find that it's a

202
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:42,540
personal plea, it's a passionate plea. I believe it's a purposed plea. There's a

203
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,380
purpose in this plea, in this prayer, and it's exciting. Notice what he says in

204
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:57,819
verse number 24, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way

205
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:03,939
everlasting. You know what I believe the purpose is? The purpose is to be right with God.

206
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:12,219
Amen? And lead me in the way everlasting. Lord, I want you to search me, I want you

207
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:17,020
to try me, I want you to know me, I want you to see if there's any wicked way in

208
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,140
me. Reveal that to me so that you then lead me in the way everlasting so that I

209
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:29,140
can be right with you. The idea of nothing between my soul and my Savior. The idea

210
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,979
of having that sweet communion with our Lord and Savior. The purpose of

211
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:41,619
David praying the prayer, the purpose of the plea that we read, is that I want to

212
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:47,459
be right with my Savior. I want to be right with God. God, if there's anything wicked

213
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:55,459
in me. See, we look at verse number 21 and 22. It's interesting, the verses leading

214
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:00,380
directly into the prayer that finishes the psalm. He says, do not I hate them, O

215
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,819
Lord, that hate Thee, and am not I grieve with those that rise up against Thee. I

216
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,979
hate them with perfect hatred. I count them mine enemies. Then he says, search me, O

217
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:14,420
God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. See if there be any wicked way

218
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,420
in me and lead me in the way everlasting. In the very context of what he's saying

219
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,459
in verses 21 and 22, he's saying, but God, I want it to be a righteous thing. I don't

220
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:31,660
want it to be a carnal thing. The reality this evening is that there are times in

221
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,219
our lives when we think, well, and in fact, even as you speak with lost people and

222
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,900
you confront them with their need for the Savior, on many occasion I've had

223
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,219
people say, well, I've never murdered anybody. Well, I mean, that's a good thing

224
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,979
that you never murdered anybody, right? I've never committed, and they might list

225
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:55,500
something that they think is a big sin in their minds. You know, it's interesting

226
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,979
that when the Lord in the epistles, and you can read various portions of

227
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:08,219
Scripture, when He's giving instruction to His people about the importance of

228
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:11,739
our walk, I think of Ephesians specifically, and you think about the

229
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:16,060
latter half of the book and really dealing with chapters 4 and 5 and

230
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,260
looking at all of the things with regard to our walk with the Lord and how we

231
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,099
walk, how we behave. You know what He deals with? He doesn't deal with don't

232
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:29,859
murder people. He doesn't deal with don't commit adultery. He doesn't deal, no, He

233
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:41,900
says, tell the truth. Don't lie. He says, be angry and sin not. Right? He says, let

234
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,819
not the sun go down upon your wrath. The things that He says in Ephesians 4 and

235
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,579
5, the instruction that He's given, the importance of our walk, see, sometimes we

236
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,380
overlook some of those things in our own lives because we're so concerned about

237
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:04,099
some bigger things. We fail to realize that they're causing my walk with my

238
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:11,260
Savior to be hindered. And sometimes we're too busy looking at someone else

239
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:19,380
and looking at someone else's problem, someone else's sin, someone else's... and if

240
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,180
I can find someone that's doing something worse than I am, it can somehow

241
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:34,459
make me feel okay. But the psalmist says, search me. Search me, O God, and know my

242
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:43,180
heart. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and

243
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:49,739
lead me in the way everlasting. Why? Because I want to be right with God. I

244
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:56,380
want to have that proper fellowship with God that is possible. It's

245
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,979
going to require some humility to pray a prayer like this. It's going to help us

246
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:08,459
to recognize the importance of taking that personal approach. God work in my

247
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:16,420
life. As we prepare for revival, I honestly don't have many times to

248
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:23,140
preach between now and then with regard to messages of preparation. We have an

249
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,300
outdoor service on Sunday evening. We have an Awana ceremony awards on

250
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,780
Wednesday evening a week from now. And I want to encourage you that as we prepare

251
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,380
spiritually for this revival meeting, yes, we pray broadly, corporately, that God

252
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,979
would work in the midst of his people. But I wonder this evening how many of us

253
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:50,500
will say, as the psalmist said here in Psalm 139, God, I'm the one that needs

254
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,219
you to work in my life. Lord, I want to be thoroughly right with you. I'm

255
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,699
not concerned about what somebody else is doing and how somebody else is

256
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:05,540
behaving and how somebody else is acting. I just, God, I want you to work in my life.

257
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,219
You know what the beautiful thing is? If everyone takes that approach, God works

258
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:16,619
amazing ways, right? But if everybody's taking the approach of, man, I hope you

259
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:20,260
work in that guy's life, I hope you work in that person's life, and then we miss

260
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,939
what God has for us. Search me, oh God. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank

261
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:32,900
you for loving us. We thank you for this brief thought this evening. From this

262
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:40,939
familiar passage of Scripture, it is my prayer tonight, personally, you'd work in

263
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:49,260
my life. Lord, I pray that somehow this evening this familiar passage of

264
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:58,459
Scripture has helped someone. I know that you helped me. Lord, I pray it is my

265
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:06,459
desire that you'd work corporately in our midst. God, I long to have you work

266
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:14,020
in my life personally. God, I repeat these words of the psalmist and desire that

267
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,780
you would work in my life. Thank you for the privilege of prayer. We thank you for

268
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,500
the power of prayer. And I pray as we gather here at the church house and pray

269
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
together, you'd bless and work. I pray for our families that are tuned in via

270
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,579
livestream. Oh Lord, I pray they would not hustle to some other activity, but

271
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:43,739
they spend time in prayer, understanding the importance and the power of prayer.

272
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:49,859
We thank you, even as we began our service this evening, that you're a God

273
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,619
who does answer prayer. We pray that you would be honored and glorified and we'll

274
00:25:54,619 --> 00:26:00,020
thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen. Let me share some updates with

275
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,180
you in our prayer bulletin. I want to start first with the insert.
