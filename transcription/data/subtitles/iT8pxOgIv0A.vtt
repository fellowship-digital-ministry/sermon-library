00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
10 this morning, Hebrews chapter number 10.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.340
And we'll pick up where we left off last week.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.300
We looked at the first 18 verses

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.119
of Hebrews chapter number 10 last week,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.800
verses one through 18.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
And this morning, we'll be looking at verses 19 through 25.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hebrews chapter number 10, verses 19 through 25.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.120
Notice in verse number 19, the Bible says,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.799
"'Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:28.940
"'into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.279
"'by a new and living way,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.299
"'which he hath consecrated for us through the veil,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.279
"'that is to say, his flesh,

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.659
"'and having an high priest over the house of God,

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.740
"'let us draw near with a true heart

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.500
"'in full assurance of faith,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.919
"'having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.259
"'and our bodies washed with pure water.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.459
"'Let us hold fast the profession of our faith

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:58.119
"'without wavering, for he is faithful, that promised.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.080
"'And let us consider one another

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.540
"'to provoke and to love and to good works,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.080
"'not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.760
"'as the manner of some is,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800
"'but exhorting one another and so much the more

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.599
"'as ye see the day approaching.'"

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.639
In verse number 20, the Bible says,

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.599
"'By a new and living way,''

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.120
and this morning, I wanna preach a message

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.800
that I've simply entitled, A New and Living Way.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.480
As we have read through and studied the book of Hebrews,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.879
of course, we're continuously confronted

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:29.919
with this truth of the superiority

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.620
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.080
The evidence has been carefully presented.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.199
In fact, as you read these first 10 chapters

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:38.480
and you read up to the place

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.440
in which we find ourselves this morning,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.540
you find that the evidence has just been calculated

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.620
and just, I mean, just presented

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.400
in such a professional manner.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.900
We know it's the word of God.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.620
We know that it's perfect and it's true,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.839
but when you think about the recipients

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.839
and even as it's been preserved for us here still today,

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.839
that as we read the truth of the book of Hebrews

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:03.199
and you see how the evidence is so carefully presented

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.160
and at this particular junction

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.599
as we come to verse number 19

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.960
and look at the text that we're dealing with this morning,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.380
I really believe that we now are beginning to see

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.039
the application of all that has been,

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.279
the entire case that has been made

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.720
and the case, again, has been presented.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.559
We mentioned often as we studied

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.479
throughout this particular section of Hebrews

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.839
with the fact that the superiority

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.279
of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.919
and we mentioned how that the writer

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.000
would use the Old Testament prophecies

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.479
and he would properly apply them

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.399
to the person of Jesus Christ,

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.000
and then he would present Jesus Christ

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.759
as being the fulfillment of those sacrifices,

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.600
and then over these chapters,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.559
prove that he is so far better.

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.800
He is superior in every way.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.360
Of course, we are reminded,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440
we remember as we've studied the passages

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.039
of leading up to chapter number 10 here,

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.839
that our great high priest ministered in a better place

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.059
and he presented a better offering.

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.160
We find that when he offered himself,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.199
he was able to accomplish in one sacrifice

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.440
that which the Old Testament sacrificial system

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.080
could never accomplish.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.100
Remember, as we looked last week

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.880
at the first 18 verses of chapter number 10

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.559
and we spoke about the introduction of this chapter,

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.080
how the law having a shadow of good things to come,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.520
and we find the fact

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.399
that the Old Testament sacrificial system was inadequate.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.440
It was a constant reminder of sin,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.000
but when Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.119
came to this sin-cursed world

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:49.160
and he made one sacrifice for sin forever,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.259
he accomplished in that single sacrifice

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.020
what could never be accomplished

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.300
through the Old Testament sacrificial system.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.940
And we mentioned at the end of our passage last week

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.380
that it's not a remembrance of sin,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.139
but there is a remission of sin.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.259
And what a glorious truth that is.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.259
We understand that Jesus Christ went to that cruel cross

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.139
and just before he gave up the ghost,

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.579
he said, it is finished.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.660
And what a blessing to understand

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.000
that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.799
he went to that cross,

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:24.440
he was buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.200
he rose in victory,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.579
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:30.320
It's interesting, as you notice,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.559
the first few words of our text of Scripture

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:35.200
that is before us this morning,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.880
notice in verse 19, he says,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.399
having therefore brethren.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:42.160
And so we understand that as we look

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
at these first few words of verse number 19,

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.220
that the writer, he's writing to save people.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.820
Brethren, amen.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.140
And we understand that terminology

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.579
used throughout the New Testament

00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:57.820
to refer to those that have been born again,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.420
those who are saved from their sin

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.679
and they're heaven bound.

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.739
And I'm thankful this morning

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:04.899
that if you are saved,

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.940
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.220
that we are counted as brethren, amen.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.079
And what a wonderful truth that is.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.739
And he says, having therefore brethren again,

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:19.619
he's going to explain to them

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.220
how that these marvelous truths

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.299
that have been presented so systematically

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:29.059
and so just, I mean, carefully presented,

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:32.739
he's now gonna say, here's how it impacts your life.

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:35.500
Notice with me as we look at the passage

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.859
in verses 19 through 21,

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:37.739
if you're taking notes,

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:39.660
notice what we have received.

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:42.420
He says in verses 19 and 20,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.220
as we look at this truth that is before us,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.980
he reminds us that because of all of this truth

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.059
that has been presented,

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.500
because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.660
because of his sacrifice,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.739
when he offered himself his sacrifice for sin,

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:00.179
his death, burial and glorious resurrection,

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:01.940
that one thing that we have received

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.339
according to verses 19 and 20

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.220
is access into the holiest of all.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.019
Notice, he says, having therefore brethren,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:13.980
notice this, boldness to enter into the holiest,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.559
notice what it says, by the blood of Jesus.

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:21.880
We understand that over the last section

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.119
of the book of Hebrews,

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.480
that often what has been in view

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.119
is that day of atonement on the Jewish calendar

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:30.600
once a year where they would make a note

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.679
of how the high priest would enter,

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:34.399
not simply into the holy place,

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.079
but on that single day each year,

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:39.239
he would enter into the holy of holies

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.200
and he better not go in there without blood.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.119
He could only enter once a year

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:47.720
and we understand that he would enter

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.160
that first time and he would bring

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.559
the blood of that bull to present for his own sin

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.320
and then we find that he would exit

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.119
and then he would go back in

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.959
and he would take the blood of that goat

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.359
to present for the sins of the people

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:04.920
and how important it was

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.440
that he would enter into with the blood.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.559
We understand that our Savior is perfect,

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.640
he's sinless, he did not have to make an offering

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.880
for his own sin, simply for the sin of the world

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.079
and so he entered once

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.839
and now because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.239
on the cross of Calvary,

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:27.399
we find that we now have access into the holiest.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.239
We find that he says that we have boldness

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:33.880
to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.920
by a new and living way,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.679
which he hath consecrated for us through the veil,

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:43.959
that is to say, his flesh.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.440
This morning in my Bible reading,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.399
I was actually finishing the last half

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.160
of the book of Matthew

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
and as I was reading through the book of Matthew

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.880
early this morning and finishing up

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.160
and reading about what the Lord Jesus Christ suffered

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.920
for my sin and for your sin and for the sin of the world

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.079
and I was reading those passages of scripture once again

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:07.839
and I was reminded how that when he gave up the ghost,

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:11.500
how that the veil of the temple was rent in twain,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.440
showing us that there was access

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.920
that was now made available

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.119
and we find here that that access is available.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:19.739
It is a new and living way.

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:22.920
You understand that until this time in history

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.640
for the Jewish people,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.399
if they were to go and to make these sacrifices,

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:30.959
that priest could not just decide on any particular day,

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:34.000
I think I'm gonna go into the holy of holies.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.039
It would be very dangerous for him to do so

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.119
and we understand that now as New Testament believers,

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:43.119
there is a new and living way

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.400
and we have access into the holiest.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.840
It's interesting and we'll make note in just a moment

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.080
with regard to this opportunity that we have

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.919
and how this truth of what we have received

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.080
should impact us.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.960
We find that it says through the veil,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.719
that is to say his flesh.

00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:02.320
I'm so thankful that he offered himself.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.760
Remember, we've often mentioned

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.799
how that he presented a better offering.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:10.000
Remember, it was that offering of bulls and goats,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.080
the blood sacrifices throughout

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.159
all of the Old Testament period of time,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:16.760
the nation of Israel in their history

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.200
and you find that the writer concludes

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.400
in Hebrews chapter number 10

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.679
that it could never with those sacrifices

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:25.239
which they offered year by year

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:28.159
continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.559
There's a constant reminder in verse number 11,

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:33.679
it says every priest standeth daily ministering

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:36.919
and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:39.640
notice, which can never take away sins.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.159
But Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:43.559
He went to that cruel cross

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.280
and He provided a way for us,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.599
a new and living way,

00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:48.559
which He in verse number 20

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.359
hath consecrated for us through the veil,

00:09:50.359 --> 00:09:52.599
that is to say His flesh.

00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:56.000
Remember, the beginning parts of the book of John,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.840
when Jesus said,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.520
destroy this temple in three days,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.919
I'll rise it up, right?

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.619
And they began to question

00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:03.959
and began to have some concern about that.

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.779
He spoke about the temple of His body.

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:10.139
In fact, as you read the end of Matthew,

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:12.059
chapter 27, you begin to see

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:14.419
after Joseph of Arimathea comes

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.259
and they're going to take the body of Jesus

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:18.179
to that borrowed tomb,

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:20.819
that the enemies come and they say,

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:23.299
we remember what this man said.

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:25.579
And so let's make this sepulcher

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:27.419
as sure as possible,

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.939
lest His disciples come

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:31.739
and steal Him away by night.

00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:33.179
We understand that the disciples

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.739
didn't have to come and steal Him away

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.699
because He would rise and conquer

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:39.379
sin, death, and the grave.

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:41.519
And so we find that we now have access

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.519
into the holiest in verses 19 and 20.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.939
Notice what we've received

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:47.219
according to verse 21.

00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:48.339
Notice what he says.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:51.099
"...and having a high priest

00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:55.499
over the house of God."

00:10:55.499 --> 00:10:57.979
We've often over these last several chapters

00:10:57.979 --> 00:10:59.339
literally going all the way back

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:01.019
to the end of chapter 4.

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:03.819
We have labored through these chapters

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:04.939
of the book of Hebrews

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:06.899
dealing with and proving the fact

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.739
that our High Priest,

00:11:08.739 --> 00:11:10.299
our great High Priest,

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:11.499
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:15.379
that He is superior.

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:16.379
The Jewish people,

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:18.819
the folks that were the original recipients

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:19.859
of this book,

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:21.219
they understood what it was

00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:22.579
to have a high priest.

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:24.899
They understood the role of the high priest.

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:26.859
This was something that was very common to them

00:11:26.859 --> 00:11:28.499
and something that they would be familiar with

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:31.579
as they would leave that Judaism

00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:32.539
and that system,

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:34.459
that Old Testament sacrificial system,

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:37.659
they're leaving that high priest.

00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:39.979
But we find that the writer is saying,

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:42.219
but we have a high priest.

00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:45.299
And our high priest is better.

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:46.459
He's greater.

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.659
He's over the house of God.

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:51.419
Remember, in Hebrews 4 and verse 14,

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.219
the Bible says,

00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:54.539
"...seeing then that we have

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.419
a great High Priest

00:11:56.459 --> 00:11:58.659
that is passed into the heavens.

00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:01.299
Jesus, the Son of God,

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:04.099
let us hold fast our profession,

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.539
for we have not a high priest

00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:06.459
which cannot be touched

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.019
with the feeling of our infirmities,

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.819
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:11.819
yet without sin."

00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:13.539
There in chapter 5,

00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:15.899
as he begins dealing with the duties

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:18.259
and responsibilities of the high priest

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.219
and what they very much would have been familiar with,

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:24.419
he's given the truth

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.779
prior to presenting that evidence

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.299
that we have a high priest.

00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:31.619
And what a joy that is.

00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:34.139
So we notice in v. 19-21,

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:35.739
we notice what we have received,

00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:37.739
but I want you to consider now with me

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:39.819
how we should respond.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.779
As a result of these great truths,

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:43.739
we now see that there are three ways

00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:46.339
in which the child of God should respond.

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:48.259
It is interesting and noteworthy

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.339
as you look at v. 22-25

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:52.179
how you'll see this phrase,

00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:53.739
let us.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:55.499
You see it at the beginning of v. 22,

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.099
the beginning of v. 23,

00:12:57.099 --> 00:12:58.899
and again at the beginning of v. 24.

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:02.419
V. 24-25, similar thought in both of those verses.

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:04.179
That's why you don't see it again

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:06.419
specifically to start v. 25.

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.779
But let's look at these three indications,

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:11.459
these three truths that we find

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:14.699
on how it is that we as the children of God

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:15.739
should respond.

00:13:15.739 --> 00:13:19.299
Understanding, again, all of the evidence

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.859
that has been provided

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.419
and all of the truth that has been presented

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:25.499
by the writer,

00:13:25.499 --> 00:13:27.419
and now we're going to take,

00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:28.259
we're going to say, okay,

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.579
now here's how that affects us.

00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:33.259
Here's how that impacts us.

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.099
Isn't that wonderful?

00:13:35.099 --> 00:13:37.099
See, it's great to know

00:13:37.099 --> 00:13:38.859
that we have a great high priest.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.819
It's great to know that Jesus is superior,

00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:43.499
that He's greater than the prophets,

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:45.219
that He's greater than the angels,

00:13:45.219 --> 00:13:46.659
that He's greater than Moses,

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.059
that He's greater than Abraham,

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:50.539
that He's greater than the Aaronic priesthood.

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:53.179
It's great for us to understand those things,

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:54.779
but what does it mean for me?

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:57.139
How does it impact me?

00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:59.179
And remember, these believers

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:01.339
that are being written to here in the book of Hebrews,

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:03.139
they're dealing with this struggle

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:05.779
and this pool of returning to Judaism,

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.979
returning to that Old Testament sacrificial system.

00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:10.939
And the writer of Hebrews is saying,

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:13.339
but Christ is so much better.

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:15.099
Look at what He offers.

00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:17.819
Look at what you have in Christ

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:19.499
that you could never have

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:21.579
in that Old Testament sacrificial system

00:14:21.579 --> 00:14:25.259
because if it would have allowed you to be made perfect,

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:28.219
you would have stopped bringing those offerings.

00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:30.019
But you never were able to stop bringing the offerings

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:32.459
because it never could make you perfect.

00:14:32.459 --> 00:14:36.819
Now, we understand that God Himself is the one

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:40.179
that ordained that Old Testament sacrificial system.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.939
And He is the one that ordained it

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:43.459
so that it would be a type,

00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:47.019
a picture of what Jesus would accomplish

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.499
on the cross of Calvary.

00:14:48.499 --> 00:14:51.539
The real thing is always better

00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:54.459
than what we see in looking at the passage.

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:55.659
And you think about what He says

00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:58.339
at the beginning of verse number one in Hebrews 10,

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:01.179
the law having a shadow of good things to come.

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:02.099
You think about a shadow.

00:15:02.099 --> 00:15:03.179
It's not the real thing.

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:05.619
It's not the very image.

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:07.939
And what a great way that the writer

00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:09.939
presents this truth to us.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:13.659
And so now as He's going and making this application,

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:16.259
He says, now brethren,

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:20.059
we understand that because we now have access

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:24.499
into the holiest because Jesus has provided that access,

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:28.459
now we understand that we do have a high priest,

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:29.859
the great high priest,

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.539
our Lord Jesus Christ, and He is superior.

00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.659
Notice how we should respond.

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:36.939
Number one, in verse number 22,

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:40.139
it says, let us draw near.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.139
Let us draw near.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:42.539
Notice what He says.

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:47.539
With a true heart in full assurance of faith.

00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:51.699
We just sang blessed assurance.

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:53.259
It was the last congregational song

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:54.699
that we sang this morning.

00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:56.819
What a wonderful hymn that is.

00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.699
I'm so thankful for the Word of God

00:15:58.699 --> 00:16:00.699
that helps the child of God

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:04.339
understand their security in Christ.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:07.819
I'm so thankful that God in all of His wisdom

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:10.819
that He's provided us with passages of Scripture

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:14.219
that teach us about the eternal security of the believer,

00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:17.899
that we can have assurance of our salvation,

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:20.819
that we can have that confidence.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:22.819
We find that He says here,

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:24.899
listen, He's provided access

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:27.579
and therefore we should draw near.

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:28.659
Does that make sense?

00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:35.419
How sad it is to understand that we have access

00:16:35.419 --> 00:16:38.099
into the very throne room of God,

00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:40.459
yet we say, I'm too busy.

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:46.459
We understand the truth that we have the access.

00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:48.459
We have the opportunity.

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:51.339
In fact, He's given us the invitation.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:53.219
And so what does He say?

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:56.379
Because we have access, let us draw near.

00:16:56.379 --> 00:16:57.259
Let us come.

00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:59.659
Let us approach in full assurance

00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:02.659
in that confidence that He mentions here.

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:04.259
Let us draw near with a true heart

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:06.019
in full assurance of faith.

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:08.339
Now, understand with me this morning

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.619
that there are some places upon this earth

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.819
that you do not have access to.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.499
There are some places upon this earth

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:16.539
that I do not have access to.

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:18.819
If you work in a corporate setting,

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.379
perhaps you have some kind of an ID badge.

00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:23.779
And back in the day, like nine months ago,

00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:25.419
when you used to go to the office

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.779
and people actually had to use their little badge

00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:29.939
to get into the building.

00:17:29.939 --> 00:17:31.339
When I worked for Sikorsky,

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:32.539
there were certain buildings

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:35.539
that my badge would give me access to.

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:36.499
And there were other buildings

00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:39.019
that I did not have access to.

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:39.859
Why?

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.339
Because I wasn't supposed to be in those buildings.

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:45.819
There were things taking place in those buildings

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:48.299
with manufacturing processes

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:51.899
that I was not supposed to be there.

00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:54.539
So my badge wouldn't let me in.

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.579
I didn't have access.

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:59.499
But Jesus has provided the way.

00:17:59.499 --> 00:18:02.019
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:05.139
John 14, remember Jesus said that to His disciples.

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:07.059
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:10.659
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

00:18:10.659 --> 00:18:13.299
And we find this new and living way.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:15.179
And so we have access.

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:18.019
It's good to know that we have the access,

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:21.659
but the response to understanding that truth

00:18:21.659 --> 00:18:23.659
is that we draw near.

00:18:25.699 --> 00:18:30.139
How confusing it is to know that we have access

00:18:30.139 --> 00:18:32.700
and yet decide not to enter.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.619
To forego the opportunity of fellowship.

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:40.779
To forego the privilege of prayer.

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.779
In His presence, the psalmist said,

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:46.500
is fullness of joy.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.059
And so the writer says the first response

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:52.179
to the truth that has been presented

00:18:52.179 --> 00:18:53.260
is that we should draw near.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.539
Notice as he continues the latter part of verse number 22,

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:59.139
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.099
and our bodies washed with pure water,

00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:04.260
you understand the ceremonial washings

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.299
that they would deal with,

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:08.419
and understand again as these Jewish believers

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:11.419
would be receiving this particular book

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:14.739
and understanding the familiar aspect

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:16.779
that they would have with all that took place

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:18.059
on that day of atonement.

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.419
We're familiar as you would think

00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:21.219
about the tabernacle itself.

00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:23.260
And that's the greatest similarity

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.940
to what God is giving us here in the book of Hebrews.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.219
And you'd understand that after that brazen altar is what?

00:19:29.219 --> 00:19:30.139
It's the laver.

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:31.820
It's the place where they would wash.

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:34.979
It's interesting there's no dimensions that are provided.

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:37.260
In John chapter number 13,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.299
we find that Jesus as He would wash the disciples' feet,

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:42.299
that it's a picture of that importance

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:44.219
of being cleansed for service.

00:19:44.219 --> 00:19:47.299
And we can be reminded here in verse number 22

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:49.979
about our response that we're to draw near.

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:53.339
And we can understand that we are able to draw near.

00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:55.899
Our hearts have been sprinkled from an evil conscience

00:19:55.899 --> 00:19:57.979
and our bodies washed with pure water.

00:19:57.979 --> 00:19:59.459
We understand also,

00:19:59.459 --> 00:20:02.459
actually, as we finished up the last section last week,

00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.959
that we have remission.

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:05.739
Amen?

00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:08.039
You understand this morning

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:11.159
that this truth of Hebrews 10

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:13.119
that we're dealing with this morning,

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.999
that this is a truth that is given

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:18.079
to a believer to draw near.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:20.919
See, the lost person doesn't have access to God

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:23.259
the same way that you have access to God.

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:25.259
He must first come to the cross.

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:25.959
Amen?

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:27.879
He must first trust Jesus Christ

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:29.339
as his personal Savior,

00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:31.219
and once he trusts Jesus Christ

00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:32.419
as his personal Savior,

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:34.179
he now has this access

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:35.419
that we're speaking of this morning.

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:35.959
Why?

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:37.679
Because we've been justified.

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:39.219
We have been made righteous,

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:40.759
declared righteous.

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:42.579
We understand the righteousness of God

00:20:42.579 --> 00:20:44.339
has been imputed upon us,

00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:46.719
and we have remission.

00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:48.719
What a blessing.

00:20:48.719 --> 00:20:50.219
And so we can draw near.

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:52.259
We can draw near.

00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:54.539
We find that in Hebrews 4,

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:57.179
I mentioned I read verses 14 and 15 already,

00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:00.599
how wonderful the connection is here

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:03.099
between Hebrews 10 and verse 22

00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:05.059
and Hebrews 4 and verse 16.

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:07.599
We read verses 14 and 15 a moment ago

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.759
dealing with the fact that we have

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:12.559
a great high priest.

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.059
And what was the impact

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:16.259
of that recognition of that truth?

00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:18.479
It was this in verse 16,

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:22.139
Let us therefore come boldly

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:24.179
unto the throne of grace,

00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:26.019
that we may obtain mercy

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:28.279
and find grace to help

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.639
in time of need.

00:21:30.639 --> 00:21:32.979
I'm so thankful that we can go boldly

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:34.059
to the throne of grace.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:36.279
That we can go in full assurance,

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:39.519
understanding that we are the children of God.

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:40.859
Isn't that wonderful?

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:44.779
Remember the story of the prodigal son?

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:47.479
He went out and he wasted all of his living.

00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:48.519
Right?

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:51.139
He was eaten in the slop.

00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:51.979
He had nothing.

00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.859
He'd wasted everything.

00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:56.619
Why did he go home?

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:57.939
Yes, he was at the end of himself,

00:21:57.939 --> 00:21:59.619
but he had an opportunity.

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:01.979
He had a relationship.

00:22:01.979 --> 00:22:03.579
And we understand this morning

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:05.239
that as we look at the truth here

00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:06.859
of Hebrews 10,

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:10.159
and we see how these marvelous truths

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:11.319
have been presented,

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:13.399
we now find the application for us

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:14.739
as the people of God,

00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:15.739
as the children of God.

00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:17.439
Remember, having therefore brethren.

00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:19.779
He's writing to the believers.

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:21.739
He's giving them this admonition,

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:22.699
this encouragement.

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:24.779
Let us draw near.

00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.159
We understand that Peter will deal

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:28.079
with the truth of the priesthood

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:29.279
of the believer.

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:31.359
And we as Baptist people,

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:32.859
if we were to go through the list

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:34.279
of Baptist distinctives,

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:36.039
we find that first and foremost

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.619
is that we would say that the Bible

00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:39.699
is the sole authority for faith and practice,

00:22:39.699 --> 00:22:41.659
but then we would get down to the fact

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:45.359
of the priesthood of the believer.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:47.859
And what a joy to know that we can enter

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:48.899
into His presence,

00:22:48.899 --> 00:22:50.499
that we can draw near

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:54.339
with that full assurance of faith.

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:56.339
Notice, number two,

00:22:56.339 --> 00:22:58.539
in these responses that are provided to us

00:22:58.539 --> 00:23:00.079
in v. 23,

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:02.299
let us, notice v. 23,

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:06.579
hold fast the profession of our faith

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:07.699
without wavering.

00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:10.419
Let us hold fast to keep or to possess.

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:12.959
We find that he says our profession

00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:15.379
or the profession of our faith.

00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:18.539
Then notice this, without wavering.

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:19.779
Without wavering.

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:21.019
It's interesting as you look at

00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:22.479
what's taking place again

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:24.279
during the particular time

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.279
in which the book of Hebrews is written,

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:29.399
and you understand all of the difficulty

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:31.399
in which these believers are facing,

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:35.479
and yet we find that as the book of Hebrews

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:38.739
would present what we have in Christ

00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:41.359
and what Christ has provided for us,

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:43.779
He tells these believers

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:47.779
to hold fast the profession of our faith

00:23:48.019 --> 00:23:50.439
without wavering.

00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:51.279
To hold it fast.

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:52.519
To keep. To possess.

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:54.439
The profession, that's really our confession,

00:23:54.439 --> 00:23:56.639
our salvation of our faith.

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:59.139
It's interesting that that word faith

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:02.239
is often translated as hope.

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:04.979
And we understand even as the girl sang this morning,

00:24:04.979 --> 00:24:06.979
our hope is Jesus.

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:09.179
And we speak about the blessed hope

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:11.179
and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:12.559
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:16.479
And I'm so thankful that when we use the word hope

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:18.719
from a biblical perspective,

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:23.639
that hope is a certain expectation

00:24:23.639 --> 00:24:26.719
based upon revealed truth.

00:24:26.719 --> 00:24:28.559
It's not this pie in the sky,

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.479
I'm just hoping that something's going to happen,

00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:32.479
it's gonna get better, it's gonna whatever.

00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:36.099
No, no, I have full assurance and full expectation

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:39.519
because of what God has said.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:42.179
Notice He says without wavering.

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:44.519
Why would we not waver?

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.179
How is it that we could not waver?

00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:50.379
Notice He says, what a wonderful reminder

00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:52.259
at the end of verse number 23,

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:54.379
how it is that we could have no wavering,

00:24:54.379 --> 00:24:58.979
for He is faithful, that promised.

00:24:58.979 --> 00:25:01.859
Aren't you thankful that our God is faithful?

00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:05.699
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:07.779
The Apostle Paul, on a number of occasion

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:10.139
throughout the letters that God allowed him

00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:11.579
to be the human penman of,

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:15.199
will speak of the faithfulness of God.

00:25:15.199 --> 00:25:17.719
It's Jeremiah that pens the words

00:25:17.719 --> 00:25:21.319
that we believe obviously have impacted that great hymn,

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.399
great is thy faithfulness.

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:24.959
There in the book of Lamentations,

00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:26.759
and he recalls these things,

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.119
and therefore he has hope,

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:29.999
and he speaks about the mercy of God,

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:33.839
but he speaks about great is thy faithfulness.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:36.559
In Lamentations 3, in verse number 23.

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.759
And we find ourselves here looking at this truth

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.419
that we're to hold fast the profession of our faith

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:45.499
without wavering, for He is faithful, that promised.

00:25:45.499 --> 00:25:50.379
And we understand this morning the promises of God

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:52.339
that they are certain.

00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:54.719
Peter refers to the promises of God

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.739
as being great and precious promises,

00:25:57.739 --> 00:25:59.039
and certainly they are.

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:04.899
I hope this morning that you're regularly reminding yourself

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:07.499
of the promises of God,

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:10.119
and that those promises of God

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:11.759
that we find within the Word of God

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:13.199
are ministering to our hearts,

00:26:13.199 --> 00:26:14.639
and they're building our faith,

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:18.559
and they're helping us to continue without wavering,

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:19.799
even as we see here.

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.719
Notice if you go back a few chapters

00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:23.499
to Hebrews chapter number six,

00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:26.799
you may recall many weeks ago

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.919
when we studied this passage of Scripture

00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:31.239
that there's a reference here with regard to a promise

00:26:31.239 --> 00:26:32.559
that was made to Abraham,

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:33.839
and we made note of this.

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:35.679
You notice in verse number 13,

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:36.959
in Hebrews chapter number six,

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:40.339
the Bible says for when God made promise to Abraham,

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.299
because he could swear by no greater,

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:45.939
he swore by himself.

00:26:45.939 --> 00:26:49.459
You skip down and you notice in verse 15,

00:26:49.459 --> 00:26:51.859
and so after he had patiently endured,

00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:54.699
he obtained the promise.

00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:55.539
Why?

00:26:55.539 --> 00:26:56.659
Because God said it.

00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:59.219
God said you're gonna have a son, right?

00:26:59.219 --> 00:27:01.599
We mentioned as we studied Hebrews chapter number six

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:03.299
that really what's in view here,

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:05.359
not so much the promise of the land

00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:07.579
as much as the promise of the seed.

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:09.299
And we looked at Galatians chapter number three.

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:11.579
In fact, we'll look at some of that this evening

00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.259
from Genesis chapter number 12,

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:16.019
and we find here that he obtained the promise.

00:27:16.019 --> 00:27:19.739
Listen, they did have a son, did they not?

00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:21.339
Praise the Lord.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:22.659
And we're so thankful.

00:27:22.659 --> 00:27:24.219
You notice in verse number 17

00:27:24.219 --> 00:27:26.419
how the writer again is speaking

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:27.939
about this Old Testament truth,

00:27:27.939 --> 00:27:29.939
and he's speaking about these promises that were given

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:33.099
or this promise specifically that was made to Abraham,

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:36.439
and then he deals with how this should impact us.

00:27:36.439 --> 00:27:39.319
Notice in verse 17 wherein God willing more abundantly

00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:42.239
to show unto the heirs of promise

00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:45.919
the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath.

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:48.119
We find in verse number 18 and 19

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:50.559
that by two immutable things

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:54.379
in which it was impossible for God to lie,

00:27:54.379 --> 00:27:56.679
we might have a strong consolation

00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:59.079
who have fled for refuge to lay hold

00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:01.719
upon the hope set before us,

00:28:01.739 --> 00:28:06.199
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul,

00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:08.119
both sure and steadfast,

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:11.859
and which entereth into that within the veil.

00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:15.299
Hebrews 10 as we're looking here,

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:17.519
and we find that he's saying to these believers,

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:20.739
let us hold fast the profession of our faith

00:28:20.739 --> 00:28:22.939
without wavering, why?

00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:26.019
Because he is faithful that promised.

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.379
It's not a situation in which we have to say,

00:28:29.479 --> 00:28:33.399
I wonder if God's going to do what he said he's going to do.

00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:36.199
I'm so thankful that we never have to have that thought.

00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:41.199
We can rest assured that God will do

00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:43.159
what he said he will do.

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:46.039
Now admittedly, it might not be in your timeframe

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:48.339
or in my timeframe, amen?

00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:50.319
Sometimes we think that we would like for God

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:52.159
to work on our timeline,

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:54.779
but God's working on his timeline.

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:58.659
And by the way, his timeline is perfect, amen?

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:01.519
Mine's not, neither is yours.

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:04.959
So we find that the application is given.

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:06.479
Number one, let us draw near.

00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:07.799
Number two, let us hold fast.

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:09.759
Notice verse number 24 and 25.

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:11.479
Number three, if you're taking notes,

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:13.079
let us consider one another.

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:16.279
Notice here, and let us consider one another

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:19.519
to provoke unto love and to good works.

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:22.319
We'll get to verse number 25 here in just a moment.

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:24.679
It's interesting as you note that word consider,

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:27.259
it means to attentively perceive.

00:29:27.259 --> 00:29:30.839
You find that he says, here, let us consider one another,

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:32.919
and then he uses this word to provoke.

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:34.599
You know, that word typically is used

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:37.079
in a negative connotation, is it not?

00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:41.279
But here, we find that it's used in a very positive manner.

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.119
Why?

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:44.479
Because of what it is that we're provoking someone to,

00:29:44.479 --> 00:29:46.959
what it is that we're inciting them to do.

00:29:46.959 --> 00:29:50.899
Number one, he says that we're to provoke unto love.

00:29:50.899 --> 00:29:51.819
Unto love.

00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:57.659
1 Corinthians 13 deals with the subject matter of charity,

00:29:57.659 --> 00:30:00.059
and how important that subject matter is.

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:05.139
matter is we understand the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter 13 before he gave

00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:09.579
that great promise that we so often refer to in the first several verses of

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:14.099
chapter 14 but after he'd washed the disciples feet and we find that he comes

00:30:14.099 --> 00:30:18.699
and he's speaking to them and at the end of chapter number 13 he says this

00:30:18.699 --> 00:30:23.219
beginning in verse number 31 of John 13 therefore when he was gone out Jesus

00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:29.419
said now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him verse 32 if God

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:33.299
be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall

00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:40.499
straightway glorify him little children yet a little while I am with you you

00:30:40.499 --> 00:30:46.339
shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whither I go you cannot come to

00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:53.659
come so now I say to you notice this in verse 34 and 35 a new commandment I

00:30:53.659 --> 00:31:01.699
give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love

00:31:01.699 --> 00:31:08.099
one another by this by what our loved one for another by this shall all men

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:14.779
know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another what a great

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:19.419
subject matter and what a great truth it's not so much that we're to love our

00:31:19.499 --> 00:31:25.099
neighbor as ourself but we're to love as Christ loved and we understand that his

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:29.939
sacrificial love by the way the Holy Spirit of God is as we trust Christ as

00:31:29.939 --> 00:31:33.419
our Savior and the Holy Spirit of God and dwells us it's that it's the Holy

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:37.659
Spirit of God that enables us to love in the manner in which we're supposed to

00:31:37.659 --> 00:31:43.139
and we find that he says that we're to love one another as I have loved you

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:47.499
that you also love one another we find that the theme of brotherly love is

00:31:47.499 --> 00:31:51.739
carried throughout the New Testament you find that Paul is he's writing to

00:31:51.739 --> 00:31:55.419
the believers in Thessalonica that he challenges them with regard to their

00:31:55.419 --> 00:31:59.939
love one for another in fact he tells them that you already do this in first

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:05.579
Thessalonians he's really commending them on how they were demonstrating their

00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:11.579
love one for another and as he commends them for this and tells them of their

00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:15.619
love one for another in first Thessalonians 4 in verse number 9 he

00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:19.499
says but as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for ye

00:32:19.499 --> 00:32:25.899
yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed ye do it toward all

00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:29.219
the brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye

00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:37.019
increase more and more so we find that as we look at this third charge if you

00:32:37.019 --> 00:32:41.379
will that is given in Hebrews chapter number 10 the response of the child of

00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:44.939
God because of that which we have received and we find that we received

00:32:44.939 --> 00:32:49.339
that access into the holiest we've received we have in high priest he says

00:32:49.339 --> 00:32:53.619
that were to draw near that were to hold fast and he says let us consider one

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:59.299
another and as we are attentively perceiving considering one another were

00:32:59.299 --> 00:33:04.379
to provoke were to incite them number one to love and number two to good works

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:13.179
to good works unto love and to good works we understand this morning that

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:19.099
good works has never saved anyone not possible not by works of righteousness

00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:24.139
which we have done amen we understand the truth of the Word of God in fact

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:28.219
Hebrews has extensively dealt with the fact that only through the shedding of

00:33:28.219 --> 00:33:32.339
blood is remission there's no possible way that we could be good enough to get

00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:37.259
ourselves to heaven there are a number of religious organizations in the world

00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:42.819
that teach this subject matter of good works how can I get to heaven one day

00:33:42.819 --> 00:33:46.739
it's based upon what you do and all of your good works and we understand

00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:55.699
without any type of apology that that is not true the Word of God clearly

00:33:55.699 --> 00:34:01.739
indicates that it's by grace are you saved through faith amen aren't you

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:06.899
thankful for that we've often asked the questions I've spoken to some about their

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:10.859
eternal salvation and they said well I think I'm gonna go to heaven because I'm

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:14.059
a good person I do good things and so on and so forth and you go down that

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:19.019
path and you find inevitably that the individual always becomes the standard

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:23.539
how do you know if you've done enough good how do you know how bad that bad

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:27.339
thing was that canceled out those good things I mean that's a constant mess

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:32.899
there's no assurance in that Jesus said it's not possible but we understand

00:34:32.899 --> 00:34:40.379
biblically that these truths even that we find here this this this last

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:43.339
challenge that is given that we're to consider one another provoking to love

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:47.899
and to good works it's not these good works are not so that we can be saved

00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:53.819
they're not even so that we can stay saved they're a result of being saved

00:34:53.819 --> 00:34:59.699
right we understand we often quote Ephesians 2 8 and 9 for my grace are you

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:02.939
saved through faith and that not of works is excuse me and that not of

00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:06.219
yourselves of the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast but we

00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:11.579
find that verse number 10 of Ephesians 2 says for we are his workmanship created

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:18.299
in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that you should

00:35:18.299 --> 00:35:23.819
walk in them remember as we study the book of Ephesians that the first three

00:35:23.819 --> 00:35:28.259
chapters of the book of Ephesians deal with our our security in Christ who we

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:33.499
are our identity in Christ that we are accepted in Jesus aren't you thankful

00:35:33.499 --> 00:35:36.699
for that if you've trusted Jesus your personal Savior listen you're not

00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:39.899
sending your own righteousness you're sending in his righteousness it's been

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:45.339
imputed upon you and so we find that the subject matter of salvation is dealt

00:35:45.339 --> 00:35:48.779
with in those first three chapters the book of Ephesians and then he begins to

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:53.539
deal with their behavior their walk their manner of life in chapters 4 5 &

00:35:53.539 --> 00:35:58.939
6 and we've made know often and it's so important that we once again deal with

00:35:58.939 --> 00:36:04.739
this is is the fact that we are not doing those things so that we can be

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:08.059
saved the subject of salvation has already been settled we're not doing

00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:10.859
those things so that we can stay saved the subject of salvation has already

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:16.979
been settled we do those things because I am saved oftentimes there are those

00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:25.979
critics that would pit in the Word of God Paul against James they'd say the

00:36:25.979 --> 00:36:31.339
Pauline writings are in contradiction to what James says they're absolutely not

00:36:31.339 --> 00:36:35.739
in contradiction in fact as you read the Pauline epistles you often find that

00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:39.499
Paul deals with the subject of good works read the book of Titus you see the

00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:45.419
subject of good works in every chapter of the book of Titus you find that James

00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:52.219
is saying I'm gonna show you my faith by my works right the fruit of salvation

00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:59.059
are these good works the root of salvation is faith in Jesus Christ we

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:03.659
find here this morning that just as the subject matter for centuries has been so

00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:10.539
important as I was out last week I had the faith for the family radio station

00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:15.019
on and I heard some statistics that were given of a recent poll that was done by

00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:19.859
the Barna group and I understand many things about statistics and polls and

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:23.779
surveys and all of those things and they said of those that were asked this

00:37:23.779 --> 00:37:30.179
question with regard to salvation that nearly 70% of those that responded said

00:37:30.179 --> 00:37:37.499
you could be saved by being a good person our world is blinded the God of

00:37:37.499 --> 00:37:40.699
this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not right they're going

00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:47.419
around some religious person some some person that has some level of credential

00:37:47.419 --> 00:37:54.299
quote-unquote has said do these things and everything's gonna be okay Jesus

00:37:54.299 --> 00:38:00.499
said I've already done it I it is finished I paid the price and so we find

00:38:00.499 --> 00:38:07.219
that here as we find the the third level of truth that is given in verses 24 and

00:38:07.259 --> 00:38:11.859
25 that were to consider one another were to provoke one another unto love

00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:17.779
and to good works isn't it awesome how that verse number 25 then begins talking

00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:22.099
about the forsaking of the assembling of ourselves together why where is it that

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:28.019
we use the gifts that God has given us God has equipped us if you're a child of

00:38:28.019 --> 00:38:32.739
God this morning if you've been born again then you have a spiritual gift

00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:39.779
you've been gifted where do we use our spiritual gift in the church the house

00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:46.619
of God we find that the Bible says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:51.899
together notice this phrase as the matter of some is there are some that

00:38:51.899 --> 00:39:00.139
were forsaking the assembling says this but exhorting one another that phrase we

00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:05.299
find in verse 24 that were to consider one another and to provoke into love and

00:39:05.299 --> 00:39:09.379
good works now in verse number 25 we find that he says exhorting one another

00:39:09.379 --> 00:39:15.259
the idea of coming alongside someone the idea of encouraging and strengthening by

00:39:15.259 --> 00:39:20.859
consolation that we're coming alongside what a wonderful truth that we have the

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:24.779
opportunity not only to consider one another to provoke one another but we

00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:34.299
find here to exhort one another through the assembling of ourselves together we

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:38.859
have the opportunity to exhort one another I know that Hebrews 10 in verse

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:45.619
number 25 has been a verse that has been used often in 2020 it's a verse that

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:51.259
we've seen people use so frequently across the land of America as we've

00:39:51.259 --> 00:39:56.259
dealt with this pandemic and the inability of churches to be able to meet

00:39:56.259 --> 00:40:00.099
so on and so forth can I tell you that that God's design is for

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:09.739
the church to meet. It's God's plan. We find here that the idea of what was

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:13.779
taking place and what's going on, he's giving these believers this

00:40:13.779 --> 00:40:19.659
understanding that you assemble together. You know, there's something special about

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:24.939
church. And we understand that church is not the building. We understand that. We

00:40:24.939 --> 00:40:31.139
often refer to, we're going to church, right? We use that terminology. Oh yeah,

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:35.699
there's the church building. This is just the place that God has given us to meet.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:43.019
But the church is the people. It's a called-out assembly. Amen? I mean, I hope

00:40:43.019 --> 00:40:46.699
that this building never gets destroyed, but if this building were to be

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:52.139
destroyed, it doesn't mean that the church is destroyed. Because the church is a

00:40:52.139 --> 00:40:57.019
group of people. We understand that the church is made up of saved people. We

00:40:57.019 --> 00:41:03.619
understand the truth of membership in a church and the importance of folks

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:07.819
being saved and baptized and then added to the church. And so we find that the

00:41:07.819 --> 00:41:11.659
church is of significant, you understand, it's significant to God. Listen, the

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:19.339
church was not man's idea. It was the idea of God. God ordained the church. In fact,

00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:23.539
Ephesians tells us when he gives the admonition to husbands, love your wives,

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:29.419
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. We find that Jesus said

00:41:29.419 --> 00:41:33.619
in Matthew chapter number 16, when he's speaking to Peter, he says, I will build

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:38.939
my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I'm so thankful

00:41:38.939 --> 00:41:43.699
for the church, the assembling of God's people. It's interesting that this

00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:49.059
phraseology, the assembling of ourselves, the only other time that you

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:53.259
see that same phraseology, not in the English, but in the Greek, that's used is

00:41:53.259 --> 00:41:56.779
actually in first Thessalonians 4 when we're caught up together in the clouds

00:41:56.779 --> 00:42:02.299
and we assemble with Jesus. Isn't that awesome? It's a great truth. The rapture

00:42:02.299 --> 00:42:06.699
of the church. By the way, I'm listening for the trumpet, aren't you? And what a

00:42:06.699 --> 00:42:12.019
blessing to understand that our God is soon going to return and we know that

00:42:12.019 --> 00:42:16.339
he's going to come right on time. In fact, that is how verse number 25 ends.

00:42:16.339 --> 00:42:22.419
Once again, the truth of Christ's return is in view. He says this, not forsaking

00:42:22.419 --> 00:42:25.419
the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one

00:42:25.419 --> 00:42:32.339
another. Notice this last phrase, and so much the more as you see the day

00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:40.579
approaching. Can I ask you this morning, can you see the day approaching? I think

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:45.939
it's quite obvious. I know that preachers have said it for years and

00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:49.579
it's kind of a cute little statement that we're closer now than we've ever

00:42:49.579 --> 00:42:53.259
been. That's because every single day we're one day closer than we've ever

00:42:53.259 --> 00:42:58.099
been, amen? We understand that. But the reality this morning is that when you

00:42:58.099 --> 00:43:03.219
see the events worldwide of things that are taking place and you begin to

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:08.499
see these things unfolding, you are understanding that, listen, we see the

00:43:08.499 --> 00:43:17.779
day approaching. And what is he saying? And so much the less? No, no. And so much

00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:25.299
the more. And we find the emphasis that is placed upon the assembling together

00:43:25.299 --> 00:43:31.459
of the people of God, and we find that, listen, for a long time in our culture in

00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:36.339
America, it's been very easy and convenient to be a Christian. It really has.

00:43:36.339 --> 00:43:41.499
There's not been much of a price that we've had to pay to be a follower

00:43:41.499 --> 00:43:46.299
of Jesus Christ in this nation. But we have brothers and sisters all across the

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:54.019
globe that pay high price to gather together. I read often throughout the

00:43:54.019 --> 00:43:56.779
last couple of weeks of different things that are taking place in different

00:43:56.779 --> 00:44:02.499
countries and how God is moving and how God is working. It's encouraging. He's

00:44:02.499 --> 00:44:08.459
working through his church. And we sometimes have in our mind this idea of

00:44:08.459 --> 00:44:14.859
church, this big fancy building and all of these things, but the church is the

00:44:14.859 --> 00:44:20.799
people. It's the people. And we assemble together and so much the more as you see

00:44:20.799 --> 00:44:27.379
the day approaching. See, Paul said this, that the church is the pillar and ground

00:44:27.379 --> 00:44:34.179
of the truth. It's a place where we go to fulfill that which we find here in

00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:37.539
verses 24 and 25, that we're provoking one another into love and good works,

00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:41.299
that we're exhorting one another. We find it's a place in which we receive

00:44:41.299 --> 00:44:46.739
instruction. We receive that which we need for going out and serving the Lord

00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:52.299
and being the light in the world that he's called us to be. The church is

00:44:52.299 --> 00:44:57.779
important. I know that there have been many over this pandemic that have gotten

00:44:57.779 --> 00:45:03.499
very irritated over the fact that there have been certain governors across the

00:45:03.499 --> 00:45:09.619
land and even our national leadership that have distinguished or determined

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:14.539
and denoted certain organizations as being essential. You've heard the

00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:19.979
terminology, right? I mean, here in the state of Virginia, the Commonwealth of

00:45:19.979 --> 00:45:22.939
Virginia, our governor listed certain things that are essential and other

00:45:22.939 --> 00:45:27.579
things that aren't. And something that's interesting in almost every one of the

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:34.699
states within the Union, they have said that church is not essential, right? You

00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:42.539
know what's interesting? I think for far too long the people of God have lived

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:48.979
as if the church wasn't essential. What do I mean by that? Well, it was just kind of

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:52.499
like if we can make it, we can. If we can't, we can't. You know, it wasn't that

00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:58.499
priority. And perhaps if the people of God for the last three to five

00:45:58.499 --> 00:46:05.219
generations in this country had lived as if the church was essential, we wouldn't

00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:13.459
be dealing with fighting, yes, the church is essential. Have we proven it? I agree

00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:17.179
this morning that the church is essential. We need church. I'm thankful

00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:21.579
that there was a pastor by the name of Rodney Padat that after my parents got

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:27.699
saved, he had a class and he taught my parents the importance of church. You

00:46:27.699 --> 00:46:32.899
know why I'm thankful for that? Because my parents took me to church. I got saved.

00:46:32.899 --> 00:46:38.579
There was a time in my life for a number of years where we never went to church. I

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:47.099
mean, never. Not even Easter. I just don't remember as a 9, 10, 11 year old boy

00:46:47.099 --> 00:46:51.899
I don't remember going to church ever. Sundays was a day to go to the skating

00:46:51.899 --> 00:46:59.819
rink. I'm just being transparent. It's what we did. Then my parents got saved. There's a

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:05.939
pastor that taught them the importance of church. I've often said that from the

00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:10.299
time that my parents got saved, if I could remember, recall in my mind just a

00:47:10.299 --> 00:47:15.659
handful of times that I went to church prior to that, that there's probably

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:21.779
fewer times than that that I missed church after they got saved. Because

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:25.619
somebody taught them the importance of church. I didn't start going to church on

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:29.939
Wednesday night when I became a pastor. I went to church on Wednesday night because

00:47:29.939 --> 00:47:35.619
church house was open. What I'm saying this morning is that church, we

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:39.979
find not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. It's not that idea of

00:47:39.979 --> 00:47:43.219
missing a service here and there. It's the idea of just forsaking it, leaving it,

00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:50.819
saying I don't need that. We need it. And we find that here as the believers are

00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:55.459
given this truth, what they have received, the access that they have,

00:47:55.459 --> 00:48:00.579
that Jesus is our great high priest. So what do we do? We draw near. We hold fast

00:48:00.579 --> 00:48:06.699
and we consider one another. This is the response to that which we have received

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:12.319
and we understand the the place of the local church, understand that here in the

00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:18.799
first century these believers, you know, all they really had was each other. It's

00:48:18.799 --> 00:48:22.919
all they had. In fact, there are some places around the world today that you

00:48:22.919 --> 00:48:30.479
could go and all the believers have is each other. Unfortunately in America, I

00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:37.639
say unfortunately, but the reality is that as they believe in America, for too

00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:44.959
long people have been able to get along without the church. We just need to call

00:48:44.959 --> 00:48:48.519
it like it is. I'm not angry with anybody. I'm just saying the

00:48:48.519 --> 00:48:54.439
facts. This is the way it is in America. There are a number of churches around our

00:48:54.439 --> 00:48:57.819
land that say, you know what, we should just go ahead and cancel Sunday night

00:48:57.819 --> 00:49:02.719
service. We should just go ahead and cancel Wednesday night service because

00:49:02.719 --> 00:49:09.039
the attendance is too low. People don't come. Yeah, it happens. In fact, we've had

00:49:09.039 --> 00:49:14.679
people that have contacted us just because they saw that we had a Sunday

00:49:14.679 --> 00:49:19.279
night service and they've said this, do you really have a Sunday night service?

00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:23.839
Yes, we do. It's not just like on the advertising on the board. We really do. We

00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:29.839
meet together, but you can see it. You can look at the history of it in this land

00:49:29.879 --> 00:49:35.719
and what do we see that? We see that for too long believers have been able to get

00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:39.959
along in this nation without the church, but in the first century when they were

00:49:39.959 --> 00:49:45.559
coming out of that Judaism and they were saved, man, they only had each other and

00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:54.639
the Lord. Amen? And so he says, listen, you have access. You have an high priest and

00:49:54.639 --> 00:50:01.759
therefore draw near, hold fast, and consider one another.

00:50:01.759 --> 00:50:05.879
unto love and good works do these things why because of what you've received and

00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:11.239
then you see throughout the church history you see how the church has been

00:50:11.239 --> 00:50:17.919
so blessed by God as they've fulfilled the Commission that God has given see

00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:22.519
Jesus has given us a new and living way it's so much different than that old way

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:26.199
aren't you thankful for that I listen I am so thankful to be on this side of

00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:30.359
Calvary amen and praise the Lord for what Jesus

00:50:30.359 --> 00:50:35.759
accomplished for what we received and now we need to respond let us let us do

00:50:35.759 --> 00:50:38.999
these things amen let's pray together father we love you this morning we thank

00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:42.039

intercession for us we thank you that we have access this new and living way we

resurrection we thank you that we have an high priest the great high priest

00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:25.039
our Lord Jesus Christ Lord I pray that is these marvelous truths have been

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:33.319
presented now therefore brethren as a result of understanding what we've

received here's how we respond God I pray that you would help us to draw near

00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:45.879
help us to hold fast help us to consider one another help us were to be faithful
