1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
uh... the opportunity that we have to look at this portion of scripture i

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,840
appreciate

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,000
church members who are

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,520
uh... on

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,239
q with what we're doing

6
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,960
and uh... what i mean by that will someone came in this morning as a

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,040
pastor i thought you are a pretty second print in chapter five verse number twenty

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,840
but i see

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,399
on the bulletin here the appreciation thing is the

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,079
as young person again

11
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,520
but here's why i was encouragement to me why

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,399
because it's two weeks ago that i was a second in chapter five and someone

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,959
remembered hallelujah amen

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,840
and someone said i thought we had a look at that we did but god wouldn't let me

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,880
get away from it just yet

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,080
to look at verse twenty one lord will do that next week verse twenty one's a

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,700
favorite verse of scripture just a wonderful truth

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,119
that god gives us but let me read to you to remind you second reading of chapter

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,400
five inverse twenty

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,279
a couple of weeks ago we look at verses eighteen through twenty

21
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:52,159
and uh... during that uh... message uh... two sundays ago

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,040
as we looked at this portion of scripture look at those three verses of

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,959
scripture we talked about really two thoughts number one

24
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,240
the privilege that is ours to be

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,080
an ambassador

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,519
then we said this only is it a privilege

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,360
but then we talk about what the purpose was was the purpose of being an

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,480
ambassador

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,720
and uh... we look at those two points specifically but we look at chapter five

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,839
verse number twenty one a read it for you again

31
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,680
the bible says this in second contains five verse twenty now then

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,319
we are ambassadors for christ

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,559
as though god did beseech you buy us

34
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,199
we pray you in christ's stead

35
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,239
be reconciled

36
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,319
to god

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,199
we noted from this passage of scripture that being an ambassador requires that

38
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,519
we're active not passive

39
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,839
we said this also that being a

40
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:43,440
uh... an ambassador of the lord jesus christ is more

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,040
than simply sharing a gospel tract with someone i said this i'm all for

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,559
giving out gospel tracts we have them in the back we order them regularly i i do

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,959
it's something that we should do

44
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,239
and there are times in which only we may be able to do or the only thing we may

45
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,720
be able to do is give a gospel tract

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,339
uh... a waitress an attendant somewhere at the the clerk at the store

47
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:08,720
et cetera et cetera

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,699
uh... and we may not have the opportunity to engage them in

49
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,119
conversation

50
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,240
but i said this and i didn't mean it to come across in a

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,960
uh... in an unkind way but just the reality is this we have not been called

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,320
to be god's marketing agents

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,479
that's not what god called us to be

54
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,720
god called us to be his ambassadors

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,600
and i preached that message two sundays ago and

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,960
god just again as i mentioned a moment ago wouldn't let me get away from the

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,279
thought and then took me to proverbs thirteen and verse seventeen

58
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:44,440
and the bible says in that passage of scripture in that verse a wicked messenger

59
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,199
falleth into mischief but then the end of the verse says this as often you find

60
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,279
in the book of proverbs a contrast

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,520
in a single verse of scripture the bible says this in proverbs thirteen and verse

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,639
seventeen

63
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,520
but a faithful

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,179
ambassador

65
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,000
is health

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,919
a faithful

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,639
ambassador

68
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,100
is health

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,199
as we look at the message this morning we look at this passage of scripture i've

70
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,880
titled the message a faithful

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
ambassador and i want you to think about this this morning

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,320
as we look at this verse of scripture the bible says now then

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,639
we are ambassadors for christ who is the we

74
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,600
well the we

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,960
is all of those that have been redeemed that have already been reconciled we

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,440
cannot we've been given the purpose

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,479
we've been given the ministry of reconciliation

78
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,940
but those that have been given the ministry of reconciliation are those

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,880
that have already been reconciled to god

80
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,559
we have been reconciled remember verse seventeen therefore if any man be in

81
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,559
christ

82
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:46,160
he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,880
new

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,199
paul experience that in his own life he experienced the power of the gospel

85
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,919
as he got saved and god changed his life

86
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,000
and he expected that those that he was writing to in the church in corinth

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
just as he had

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,679
had the opportunity to preach the gospel there that they too

89
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,919
uh... after trusting christ as their savior that they

90
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,479
were these new creatures they had that

91
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,320
uh... experience in their own lives and so paul as he says now then we plural

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,239
are ambassadors for christ paul understood

93
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,600
as he writes in many of the uh... letters that he writes to churches and

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
even to individuals

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,239
that his office was that of an apostle

96
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,519
he understood that

97
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,799
but we find that he also understood is through the the holy spirit giving him

98
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:36,000
the words to write all scriptures given by inspiration of god

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,559
that he was an ambassador for christ but he does not say to the church in corinth

100
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,640
uh...

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,160
and an ambassador

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,959
he says we

103
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,799
are ambassadors

104
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:51,079
in the question that god just kept bringing to my heart and my mind

105
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,519
as i was looking at this passage of scripture is this and really

106
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,399
if you wanted to use a subtitle for the message this this morning i said

107
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,480
the the title is a faithful ambassador but a subtitle might be this

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,399
what kind of an ambassador

109
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,859
are you

110
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:11,239
what kind of an ambassador

111
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,959
ask the question personally

112
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,760
see the reality this morning is that we are ambassadors

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,880
but can i say to this morning that we could be

114
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,179
good ambassadors

115
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,899
or we could be bad ambassadors

116
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,320
there are some people that

117
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,920
bill the the role we talked about the appointments of being an ambassador for

118
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,320
the united states going to a particular nation and country there are some that

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,839
fail

120
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,700
in their responsibility

121
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,700
and they have to be recalled and replaced

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,019
right we we see that

123
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,880
the reality this morning is that we are ambassadors but the question is

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,260
what kind

125
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,839
of an ambassador

126
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,260
am i a faithful ambassador

127
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,700
am i a slothful ambassador

128
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,179
you start filling in the blank all these thoughts and questions

129
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:07,899
so this morning as we consider the thought a faithful ambassador

130
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,339
and looking at the truth that we are ambassadors it's like this

131
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,700
the apostle paul says as he's writing to timothy in second timothy chapter

132
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,459
number two

133
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,980
he tells him to be a good soldier

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,540
and i said this last year as i preach through the book of first and second

135
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,299
timothy

136
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:29,019
the reality is that we're all soldiers if you're saved by the grace of god

137
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,100
at that moment of salvation you were enlisted

138
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,820
into the lord's army

139
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,339
and the question

140
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,260
is not am i a soldier the question is am i a good soldier

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,779
i don't want to be content with just being a soldier

142
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,700
paul says to timothy he doesn't use these words but he says to be a good

143
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,079
soldier i don't want you to just be a soldier i want you to be a good soldier

144
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,799
of the lord jesus christ

145
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,940
and when i think about this truth of being an ambassador this morning

146
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,820
the bible says in proverbs thirteen and verse seventeen a faithful

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,420
ambassador

148
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,660
is health

149
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,220
and we can look at that from a variety of applications this morning but i want

150
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,899
to specifically look at it

151
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,540
from the perspective of being an ambassador

152
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,420
as we find in second corinthians chapter five in verse number twenty

153
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,700
with the purpose

154
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,500
of fulfilling the ministry of reconciliation

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,299
how is that health

156
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,739
well because we're taking the gospel of the lord jesus christ

157
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:30,100
to an individual that is at variance with god because of their sin

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,660
and we have the opportunity to go

159
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,140
and to plead with them

160
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,339
to be reconciled to god

161
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,100
and it brings health it brings

162
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,220
salvation it brings

163
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,059
uh... this miracle of being born again and what a blessing

164
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,019
a faithful ambassador

165
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,799
so this morning i want you to consider number one if you're taking notes

166
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,380
a plea

167
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,720
for faithful ambassadors

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,140
a plea

169
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,820
for faithful ambassadors

170
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,140
i see first of all a plea

171
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,140
uh... a sub point there from our loving savior

172
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,859
a plea from our loving savior

173
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,380
I want you to go back to the book of isaiah if you will

174
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,260
in isaiah chapter number six we find that isaiah

175
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,100
uh... after the king had died

176
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,459
uh... he sees the lord he sees god high holy and lifted up the king was

177
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,420
Uzziah

178
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,059
and he finds that it was in that year that that

179
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,660
isaiah gets this vision

180
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,019
we read of the vision

181
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,980
in isaiah chapter number six and

182
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,780
many of us would be familiar with it but i want to read just to grab the

183
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,099
context here in verse number one

184
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,739
the bible says in the year that king Uzziah died

185
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,219
i saw also the lord

186
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,340
sitting upon a throne

187
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,099
high and lifted up and his train filled the temple by the way

188
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,859
we need to get that kind of glimpse of god

189
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:56,700
we need to see god in his rightful place he's not the man upstairs he's not

190
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,659
no no he is god

191
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:00,140
he is the holy

192
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,179
god the creator of the universe yes he loves me and yes he says

193
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,659
uh... that that he is

194
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:09,059
uh... all sorts of things to us with regard to his

195
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,299
uh... his relationship to us and i'm thankful for that

196
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,619
but all we must have a high view of our god

197
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:22,059
verse number two above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings

198
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,619
with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly

199
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,619
and one cried unto another and said holy

200
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,500
holy holy

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,419
is the lord of hosts

202
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,020
the whole earth

203
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,940
full of his glory

204
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,739
the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and that

205
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:44,619
house was filled with smoke then said I

206
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:48,780
woe is me for I am undone see when we see god in his rightful place you know

207
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,859
what happens

208
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:52,760
we see ourselves in our rightful place

209
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,219
you know what the best

210
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,020
antidote if you will the best remedy for pride

211
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
is seeing god in his rightful place

212
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,800
place, because all of a sudden you start seeing God in His rightful place, it'll humble you

213
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,220
in a moment.

214
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:13,720
Isaiah says, woe is me, woe is me, for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,140
and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the

216
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,700
Lord of hosts.

217
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,220
Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken

218
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,620
with the tongs from off the altar, and he laid it upon my mouth and said, Lo, this hath

219
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,940
touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

220
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
And then notice verse 8.

221
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,500
This is where I see, we talk about this plea for faithful ambassadors, and I see it first

222
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,180
from our loving Savior.

223
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,300
Here in verse number 8, we find that the verse of Scripture that many of us are familiar

224
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,380
with from this text, also I heard Isaiah's recounting what he hears, the voice of the

225
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,260
Lord, and here's what God said, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?

226
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,380
I would say to you this morning that it's the Lord Jesus Christ that while He was during

227
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,620
His earthly ministry, when He saw the fields, He prays and He says this, He tells His disciples

228
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,540
to pray to the Lord of the harvest.

229
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Why?

230
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,060
For the harvest is plenteous, but the labors are few.

231
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,700
There's a plea for faithful ambassadors.

232
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,220
We are ambassadors, but there's a plea for faithful ambassadors.

233
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,980
The wise man in Proverbs, he tells us that a faithful ambassador, what he brings is health,

234
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,100
and we find this morning that as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is a position

235
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
that we have.

236
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,860
It's a position of privilege, as I preached two weeks ago.

237
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,380
Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?

238
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,020
Do you hear the plea of our loving Savior?

239
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,420
Do you hear the plea of our loving Savior?

240
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,540
He gave us the Great Commission, we're familiar with it, we understand the responsibility

241
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,720
that has been ours, the privilege that is ours, and we see this plea of our loving Savior.

242
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,860
We see it here in Isaiah 6, and Isaiah responds with those words, Here am I, send me.

243
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,380
You know the amazing thing is Isaiah did not even know what the task would be at the time

244
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,260
of surrender.

245
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
You know why?

246
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,180
He saw God in His rightful place, and it really didn't matter what the task was, if God was

247
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,820
looking for a volunteer, He said, Here am I, send me.

248
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,100
God went on to tell them in the next several verses through the end of the chapter what

249
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,660
His responsibility would be, and then also told them that the people wouldn't listen

250
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
to Him.

251
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,020
Isn't that encouraging?

252
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,500
See sometimes what happens is we think, oh, well, we're going to go do this because everyone

253
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,060
wants to hear it, and then somebody doesn't want to hear it, and you get discouraged.

254
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,040
No, we do it because of obedience.

255
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,340
We do it because that's our position.

256
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:54,300
We are His ambassadors, and a faithful ambassador bringeth health, and there's a plea for faithful

257
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
ambassadors.

258
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,640
The Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 14, as He's speaking there, He says, Go out into the highways

259
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,540
and hedges and compel them to come in.

260
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,700
Compel them to come in.

261
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,300
We see a plea for faithful ambassadors, first from our loving Savior, but number two, we

262
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,060
see a plea for faithful ambassadors from a lost sinner, from a lost sinner.

263
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,380
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will, and I referenced the passage in chapter 14, but

264
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,220
I want you to look at Luke 16, and I want you to understand here, we see the plea of

265
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,780
our loving Savior, but then we see a plea from a lost sinner.

266
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,580
In Luke chapter 16, God gives to us the account here of the rich man and Lazarus.

267
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,500
Many of you would be familiar with it.

268
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,740
The Bible tells us in verse number 22, And it came to pass that the beggar died and was

269
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:54,220
carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom, and the rich man also died and was buried.

270
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:02,700
And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus

271
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,500
in his bosom.

272
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,060
The Lord Jesus Christ spoke more about hell.

273
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,700
Hell's a real place.

274
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,620
I understand today there are people that try to deny the existence of hell.

275
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,380
They talk about annihilation and all this sort of thing, and no, listen, hell is a real

276
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
place.

277
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,420
And then the Bible tells us this, that death and hell are cast in like a fire.

278
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,460
This is the second death in Revelation chapter 20.

279
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,700
It's a real place, and it's not a place I've had people tell me as I've talked to them

280
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,780
about needing to be saved, they say, oh, I know I'm going to hell, I'm going to go and

281
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
party with my buddies.

282
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,500
No, you're not.

283
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
It's a place of torment.

284
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,220
It's a place of separation.

285
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:46,420
And the worst thing about hell is that you're separated from God for all of eternity.

286
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,180
We find that here, that he's in this place of torment, this rich man, and the Bible,

287
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,780
listen, he didn't go to hell because he was rich, by the way.

288
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,060
People don't go to hell because they're rich.

289
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,060
The Bible says the wages of sin is death.

290
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,580
Amen?

291
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,980
And we know that death is not physical death, it's spiritual death.

292
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,180
And we understand that we must be redeemed, we must be reconciled, we must be born again.

293
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,620
And if you're not born again, then you go to hell, eventually the lake of fire.

294
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,620
If you're saved by the grace of God, you go to heaven.

295
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,860
Praise God, my conversation, my citizenship is in heaven.

296
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
I belong to him.

297
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,020
We sang, blessed assurance, Jesus is mine, oh, hallelujah.

298
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,460
But we see this plea from this lost sinner.

299
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,260
Notice in verse 24, and he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send

300
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,900
Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented

301
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,980
in this flame.

302
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,940
Notice initially his request is for himself.

303
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,180
His request is to have some level of comfort in this place of torment, but Abraham responds

304
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,980
in verse 25 and says, son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy good things

305
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,060
and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.

306
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,500
And beside all this, notice in verse 26, between us and you, there is a great gulf fixed so

307
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,140
that they which would pass from hence to you cannot, cannot, neither can they pass to us

308
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,260
that would come from thence.

309
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,820
So I want you to understand, listen, there's no place where you can go just for a little

310
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,420
while and you're going to, no, no, no, this, this teaching, this false teaching of purgatory,

311
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,680
it's not in the Bible.

312
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,960
It's on the Bible, all right?

313
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,040
When you die, there's two places that you can go for all of eternity and the reality

314
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,560
is that you can't change from one to the other.

315
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,620
It's impossible.

316
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,880
Your fate is sealed.

317
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,040
That's why it's so important what you do with Jesus today.

318
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,080
That's why in chapter six of second Corinthians, Paul will say today is the day of salvation.

319
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,680
That's why in Proverbs, the wise man says, boast not thyself of tomorrow.

320
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Why?

321
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,600
We don't know what a day is going to bring forth.

322
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,280
That's why James says, what is your life?

323
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,200
It's a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

324
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:16,080
How many of us can look back at our lives and be like, man, look at how quick life went.

325
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,600
Look at how quick life went.

326
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,360
Listen, some of us are at the age where previously in our lifetime we thought the age that we're

327
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,480
currently at was old.

328
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,320
And now we try to convince everybody that it's still young.

329
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
Amen?

330
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
Life goes so quickly.

331
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:44,560
All of a sudden, this lost sinner, his plea changes dramatically.

332
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:52,600
In verse 27, then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou would ascend him to my father's

333
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,080
house.

334
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:02,960
What's significant about this rich man now pleading for someone to go to his father's

335
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
house?

336
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,920
Well, see, this man, according to verse 28, had five brothers.

337
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,320
He had five brothers.

338
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:23,480
He says, for I have five brethren, that he, Lazarus, may testify unto them, my five brothers.

339
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,720
Why?

340
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:35,000
Lest they also come into this place of torment.

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,760
There's a plea from our loving Savior, but there's a plea from a lost sinner.

342
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,000
This lost sinner, God gives us the opportunity to see this interaction, to understand this

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
interaction, and this man, all he is concerned about at this very moment in his life, of

344
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,040
course his life has ended, he's in hell, but at this moment as God gives us this record,

345
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,840
all he's concerned about is his five brothers.

346
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Why?

347
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,360
He doesn't want them to come there.

348
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,739
He's in hell.

349
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,179
He's in the torment.

350
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,800
He understands that there's a great gulf fixed that you cannot pass from one to the other,

351
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,000
and he says, then send him to my father's house, because I have five brothers.

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,679
I don't want brothers to come here.

353
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
Notice what the Bible says, Abraham saith unto him, they have Moses and the prophets,

354
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
let them hear them.

355
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
What does he say?

356
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,400
They have the word of God.

357
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
Let them hear them.

358
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
Last week, Luke 24, what did Jesus do?

359
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,119
Well, starting in Moses and all the prophets, he declared unto them all the things pertaining

360
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,239
unto himself.

361
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:48,720
Now we find that Abraham says they have Moses and they have the prophets, and notice in

362
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,600
verse 30, this rich man, he says, nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the

363
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
dead, they will repent.

364
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,320
I believe that he's sincere in what he's saying.

365
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,920
He truly believed.

366
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:08,480
reality. That's not how God chose for it to work. God didn't, He's not, listen, the

367
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,180
angels don't proclaim the gospel. He did not, He did not design it so that

368
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,040
people would rise from the dead and go tell people and they'd see this great

369
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:26,980
miracle. No, He commissioned us to be His ambassadors. And this rich man is

370
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,900
pleading, a plea for faithful ambassadors. He wants this man to go. Why? Because he

371
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,580
doesn't want his brothers to go to hell. Can I tell you this morning, though you

372
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,420
might not be able to hear their voices, there are billions of people on this

373
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,100
earth that need a faithful ambassador. They need somebody to go and tell them

374
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,580
that Jesus is the way. But sometimes what happens is our mind can't fully

375
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:03,780
wrap around the billions of people. So let me make it real personal. There are

376
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,300
people in your neighborhood that need a faithful ambassador. There are people in

377
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,740
your neighborhood, there might be some people in your family that need a

378
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,700
faithful ambassador. Some people in your neighborhood, some people in your office,

379
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,060
where you work. Some people, you understand what I'm saying, because

380
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,260
sometimes we look at the billions and we think how in the world we're gonna

381
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,300
reach the billions. But it just starts sometimes with crossing the street, with

382
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,740
talking to somebody at the office, talking to a family member. There's a

383
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,460
plea for faithful ambassadors. We see it first from our loving Savior, but then we

384
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,780
see it here in Luke 16, from a lost sinner. And Abraham says in verse 31,

385
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,660
if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one

386
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,660
rose from the dead. You know how much that encourages me this morning? Here's

387
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,300
why it encourages me, because we have the power of the gospel. Sometimes we think,

388
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,020
well, if God would do some miracle, they would just believe. If God would do, no,

389
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,220
no, no. We got this book. This book is powerful. And Abraham says, if they won't

390
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,300
hear this, they're not gonna believe even if they see some great

391
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:24,860
miracle. So this morning, a faithful ambassador. I asked the question, what

392
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,260
kind of an ambassador am I? A plea for faithful ambassadors. Number two this

393
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,380
morning, the pattern of faithful ambassadors. What is the pattern? Why is it

394
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,780
that someone would say, why do we read in Proverbs 13, this verse of Scripture

395
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,660
about a faithful ambassador's health, what is it about their behavior, the

396
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,980
pattern of their life, that would cause someone to identify them as being a

397
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,180
faithful ambassador? So this morning, if we're looking at what kind of an

398
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,060
ambassador am I, and we're trying to determine am I a faithful ambassador,

399
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,660
there's certain characteristics, if you will, certain attributes about your life

400
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,740
and my life that should be present, the pattern of a faithful ambassador. What's

401
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,540
a faithful ambassador look like? Well, I believe that we see it first in the life

402
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,500
of the disciples. Look in Acts chapter 8, if you will. In Acts chapter number 8, we

403
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,740
see the faithfulness of these disciples here in this really highest point of

404
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,180
persecution. As we've read through the book of Acts from the first chapter till

405
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,380
now in chapter 8, as you understand all that's going on, this height of

406
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,820
persecution there in Jerusalem, it was a great persecution. The church was

407
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,740
scattered abroad because of this, and all the believers of the church. Now, the

408
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,140
thing that's interesting about Acts chapter number 8 is that the leaders of

409
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,620
the church, well, they stayed in Jerusalem. It was the people that were

410
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,420
scattered abroad. And the Bible says this in verse number 4 in Acts chapter number

411
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,420
8, therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere, what does the

412
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,540
Bible say? Preaching the word. You know what a faithful ambassador does? They

413
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,500
seize the opportunities. So, well, God's just not giving me any opportunities. Are

414
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
you praying for him? You know, sometimes what's interesting about opportunity,

415
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,260
sometimes they're hard to see. What do I mean by that? Well, at the moment it's

416
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,980
hard to see the opportunity, and afterwards you might see the opportunity

417
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,780
and say, man, I missed that opportunity. See, they seized the opportunity. They

418
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,100
went everywhere. Listen, they were facing great persecution, hardship, difficulty.

419
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,100
They could have left from Jerusalem, and they could have decided to do a whole

420
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,380
host of things because of the great persecution that they suffered, because

421
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,580
they had to leave. They could have complained, and they could have protested,

422
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,380
and they could have, but you know what they did? They went everywhere preaching

423
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,100
the word. They're faithful ambassadors. Can I tell you that as you look at this

424
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,860
portion of Scripture in Acts chapter number 8, it's in this passage where you

425
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,700
find the gospel gets into Samaria, the place where they would probably least

426
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:12,740
like to go. God was at work, and I'm thankful that I can look at this example,

427
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,580
a pattern of faithful ambassadors. They seize the opportunities. I believe that a

428
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,500
prayer, something like this, God, would you give me opportunity today? Would you

429
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,620
give me opportunity this week to speak to somebody about you? I believe that's

430
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,500
a kind of prayer that God would delight in answering. Amen? You say, well, I'm

431
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,580
praying for a Corvette. I'm not sure that's a prayer that God delights in

432
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,300
answering, but he delights in answering the prayer of would you give me an

433
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:54,620
opportunity to be your ambassador, your representative, to pray them, to plead

434
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,260
with them, to be reconciled to God, because that's the purpose of an

435
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,540
ambassador. I pray, God, would you give us an opportunity? And we seize the

436
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,380
opportunity. I see it in the life of Matthew. Turn back to Matthew chapter 9,

437
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,380
if you will. In Matthew chapter 9, God gives us the opportunity to read of the

438
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:18,420
calling of Matthew. Matthew was a publican, not very well liked. Amen? Tax

439
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,540
collector, that's what a publican is. And here's the deal. They were representing

440
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,860
the Roman Empire, and they could exact whatever they wanted to exact, and

441
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,500
whatever they got extra than the Romans required, they got to keep for themselves.

442
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:39,820
They were not well-liked people. But Jesus calls Matthew. Matthew's life has

443
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,860
changed. He becomes a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. We see it here, notice in

444
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,100
verse 9, and as Jesus passed forth from the fence, he saw a man named Matthew

445
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,380
sitting at the receipt of custom. He saith unto him, follow me. And he arose

446
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,980
and followed him, and it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meet in his house, in the

447
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,540
house, we know from Luke 5, it was Matthew's house, and it tells us that

448
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,860
behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

449
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,740
Again, Luke 5 tells us that it was the house of Matthew, and it tells us that

450
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,020
it was a great feast. When the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, why

451
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,060
eateth your master with publicans and sinners? Why did the Pharisees say that?

452
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:28,100
Well, because they were so, they weren't, I mean, they were so far above. They were

453
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:35,700
blinded. Jesus heard that in verse 12, and he said to them, they that behold

454
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,340
me, not a physician, but they that are sick, but go and learn what that meaneth.

455
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,500
I will have mercy and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous, but

456
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,940
sinners, to repentance. Why don't I bring us to this passage of Scripture to talk

457
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,660
about the pattern of faithful ambassadors, because I want you to see

458
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,540
not only seizing the opportunity from the disciples in Acts chapter 8, but I

459
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,660
want you to see the length by which Matthew went through. Sometimes it's going

460
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,660
to cost you something to be a faithful ambassador. The Bible tells us that he

461
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,260
opens his house, and there's a great number of people there. What was the

462
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:17,980
purpose? Was it just to have a party? No. Jesus was there, and Jesus went to talk

463
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,020
to these. They came and sat down, and we find that these are there, this great

464
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,260
company, and begin to look at Matthew, and I think about his passion, if I could

465
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,740
say that this morning, that after he rose and followed Jesus, you know what his

466
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:40,700
desire was? Were for others to see and meet and know who Jesus is. I referenced

467
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,180
it from after preaching at the youth rally a couple of weeks ago. Brother

468
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,060
Jeff mentioned this morning in Sunday school as well, but the reality is

469
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,100
that David says in Psalm 34 and verse number 8, oh taste and see that the Lord

470
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,380
is good, and why does he say that? Because he experienced the goodness of God, and

471
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,460
therefore he wanted others to experience the goodness of God. Matthew had his life

472
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:09,140
changed because of Jesus, and so now what does Matthew want to do? He wants others

473
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,900
to meet Jesus. I told that man Carlos yesterday that I met at his front door. I

474
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,660
said, listen, I just want to tell you what Jesus did for me and what he can do for

475
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:23,700
you. Why? Because Jesus is the Savior of the world. He is the one that is the way,

476
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,820
the truth, and the life. And this morning we begin to think about this. Listen,

477
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,900
there may be times that it's an inconvenience for us, quote unquote. It

478
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,020
may change our schedule. It might require us to take somebody and have coffee or

479
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:43,460
take somebody and have lunch. Why? Because I want to do the work of being

480
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:50,860
an ambassador. I want them to know that I truly care about them. Why? Because I want

481
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,060
them to be reconciled to God. I want them to go to heaven when they die, and it may

482
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,260
cost us something. It may cause us to have to get out of our

483
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,060
comfort zone. You know, we all have a comfort zone, don't we? We all have a comfort zone.

484
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,580
And Mary requires to get out of our comfort zone. Sit down with somebody and

485
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,220
ask them some questions about where they're from.

486
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,460
Take a little interest in their life. Why? So they can have that opportunity to be able to

487
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,260
share the gospel with them. To be able to share the gospel with them. Building those relationships

488
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,460
to be able to share the gospel. Being careful not to allow them to influence you. We've got

489
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,260
to be careful of that. But the reality is that we find in Matthew that after he met the Lord and

490
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,980
begins following him, it says that he has this feast at his house. I've invited people to my

491
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,500
house that are lost. I've gone and taken people to lunch. I was sharing with someone in our church

492
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,100
just this past week. I sat at their house and they were having some work done and they were

493
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,300
asking about the individual, how I met him and so on and so forth because I had given them the

494
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,300
recommendation. And I said, you know, this guy, he came to church a couple of times. He did some

495
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,900
work here and had opportunity to be able to talk to him a few times and what have you. And then I

496
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,380
took him to lunch one day. I sat there for a couple hours with him at lunch. Share the gospel with him.

497
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:24,540
And he grew up a different world religion and he was still kind of looking at that path, but he knew

498
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,420
the truth. And we chatted and he didn't get saved. I wish he did, but he didn't get saved. And I told

499
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,500
him this when he left that meeting. I said, listen, you ever got questions? You know, I'd love to be

500
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,460
able to connect with you again, so on and so forth. And just a couple of years later after that,

501
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,700
he had a relative die. I get a text on my phone from this guy saying, hey, would you pray for me?

502
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:58,460
He's still not saved, but you're trying to reach people, trying to reach people. Listen, I fail

503
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:08,540
more times than I do it the right way. But the reality is that sometimes it, I often say Ronnie

504
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:14,300
goes to Walmart to meet people and I don't. I go to get in and get out. But sometimes it's

505
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:25,020
a change in our schedule that God will allow us to be that faithful ambassador,

506
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:33,900
that we seize the opportunity, that we're willing to pay the price of being a faithful ambassador.

507
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,940
We look at the life of the Apostle Paul. He's writing. Look at Romans chapter one, if you will.

508
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,060
Look at a few verses in the book of Romans. He's writing to the church in Corinth and he says, we

509
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:54,060
are ambassadors. We are ambassadors. We find that the Apostle Paul understood what it was to be an

510
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,180
apostle, but he also understood what it was to be an ambassador. And now as the Apostle Paul is

511
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,940
writing to these believers in Corinth and he says, we are ambassadors for Christ. And he explains to

512
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,500
them the privilege and the purpose. And we now look at this truth of what does it mean to be a

513
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,100
faithful ambassador? The plea is provided to us, but the pattern, and we see in the life of

514
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,180
the Apostle Paul in verse 14 of Romans chapter one, he says, I am debtor, both to the Greeks

515
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,700
and to the barbarians, both to the wise and the unwise. Why does he have this perspective of being

516
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,460
indebted? Why is it that he looks at this from this perspective that I am debtor? What did he owe

517
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,300
to these individuals? Was it that he went through his whole life borrowing from people and he was

518
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:43,340
indebted to everyone? No. It was that he had been entrusted with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

519
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:50,940
And what was entrusted to him was not just for him. It was to be for all people.

520
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,860
Just like when we read in the account of the announcement of the birth of the Lord Jesus

521
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:03,180
Christ and they bring those good tidings, those glad tidings of great joy, that the reality is

522
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:12,300
that he says unto you, but to all people. Paul says, I'm debtor. Why? Because God gave me something

523
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:19,660
that really, yes, it saved my soul, but it's for you, to tell you about how much God loves you and

524
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,820
that he'd save you. So then what does he say in verse 15? So as much as in me is, I am ready

525
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,420
to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. I wonder this morning, are we prepared

526
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:42,140
to be a faithful ambassador? Could we say that we're ready when that opportunity comes, that

527
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,060
we're ready to seize the opportunity, that we're prayed up and we have the power of the Holy Spirit

528
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,980
of God, that we have the opportunity to be able to go to the book, the Bible, and be able to give

529
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:00,860
the truth of God's word? Why? Because the Bible gives clarity. The Bible is God's word and it's

530
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,740
profitable and it gives clarity and people will have their objections and they'll have their

531
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,700
comments and they'll have their thoughts from whatever religious background they have. But

532
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:18,060
the reality is we say, what does God say? What does the Bible say? And Paul says, as much as

533
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,820
in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel. And then he says in verse 16, for I am not ashamed

534
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,300
of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God and the salvation to everyone that believe

535
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,580
it, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. The reality is that in our lives, the pattern of

536
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:45,340
a faithful ambassador is that we should not be ashamed. We see a tire with the idea, bumper

537
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,300
stickers, other things of I am not ashamed or unashamed and what have you, and the reality is

538
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,020
that there are times in our lives, if we'd be honest, that we might find ourselves in a circumstance,

539
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,180
in a situation where we might not say that we're ashamed. We might use the word I'm a little

540
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,820
embarrassed or I'm a little, you know, I'm just kind of, I'm not a people person. I don't like to

541
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,660
talk and I just kind of, but what did we do? We failed to seize the opportunity.

542
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:19,180
And Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel. Listen, I've had so many people reject and

543
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,180
get angry. I've had people cuss at me and whatever, tell me they're going to call the

544
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,820
police on me, so on and so forth. That's all fine. You know, it's not my job. It's not my

545
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:37,340
responsibility to see them trust Christ. Some plant, some water, God gives the increase.

546
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,140
And I don't have to be ashamed about what I know to be true because they disagree with me.

547
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:51,740
I don't have to be ashamed of it. Amen? That's my God. He's my Savior. He's my Lord.

548
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,900
He's my everything. Would you be ashamed of your wife or your husband? Would you be ashamed of your

549
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,980
children? If you're sitting there with a, if somebody says, is that your wife? And you just

550
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:11,020
kind of, no, you should, that would be terrible. Would it not? How much more wonderful is our

551
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,540
Savior? You say I have the best wife in the world. I'm glad you think that. I'm being sincere. I'm

552
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,180
glad you think that. Every husband ought to think that they have the best wife in the world. Amen?

553
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:30,700
But I want you to know that as Joy Clemens sang from this pulpit, somebody reminded me of that

554
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:38,620
this past week, he is more than wonderful. He's more than your mind can conceive. Our God is so

555
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,740
great and I should not be ashamed of him. A faithful ambassador is going to seize the

556
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,340
opportunities. They're going to go out of their way. They're going to allow for their schedule

557
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:56,460
to be interrupted. Pay a price. They're going to be unashamed. We find that in the book of Romans,

558
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:02,460
Paul says in chapter 9 and chapter 10, he makes these statements about having this desire and

559
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,380
this heaviness that his brethren, his kinsmen, according to the flesh, speaking of Jewish,

560
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,460
other Jewish people, that they would be saved. Notice in Romans chapter 9 and beginning in verse

561
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,260
number one, he says, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in

562
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,580
the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. Why? For I could

563
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,060
wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh.

564
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,620
Notice in chapter 10 in verse number one, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is

565
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:37,180
that they might be saved. Notice what Paul is saying. In chapter 9 and chapter 10, Paul has

566
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,660
this heavy heart. Listen, Paul was going to heaven. There's no doubt that if you read

567
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:50,220
the New Testament, there's absolutely no doubt that Paul had confidence in his conversion.

568
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,620
There's absolutely no doubt that the Apostle Paul knew to be absent from the body was to be

569
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,780
present with the Lord. He knew that he was going to heaven. In fact, he says of the believers in

570
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,660
Philippi that he was in a straight betwixt two. What was the straight betwixt two? Having a

571
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,980
desire to part, to be with Christ, which is far better. And he had said to the same church in

572
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,340
Philippi, those believers, for me to live as Christ, but to die as gain. Why? Because I'm

573
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:23,020
going to heaven. But Paul had this burden for others to be saved. Can I tell you that a faithful

574
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:33,660
ambassador should have a burden, a burden for people to be saved, to come to the truth of

575
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,100
salvation, to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. You should have a burden, a burden.

576
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,580
I preached before, I mentioned a few weeks ago, I didn't preach the message, but I referenced

577
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:52,940
the message where the man of God wept. Paul served and ministered with tears. He had a

578
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,260
burden for people. And I wonder, as we think about this truth of a faithful ambassador,

579
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,100
we ought to have a burden.

580
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,500
I know that in our prayer list that we have a list for salvations on Wednesday evening

581
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,020
and we have names on there.

582
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,940
But I wonder, you know who the best person is to pray for those people?

583
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,860
Is the one that put the name on the list.

584
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
You know why?

585
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,100
I don't know who most of them are.

586
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,940
But you do.

587
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,380
And whoever else is reading our prayer bulletin, they don't know who most of them are.

588
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,380
But you do.

589
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Because you put them on the list.

590
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,420
And you should have a burden for lost people.

591
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,460
Why do we go out and try to share the gospel?

592
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,380
Well, because we're commanded to do so.

593
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,860
And that's the number one reason.

594
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,380
We go out of obedience.

595
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,380
But can I tell you that we ought to have a burden.

596
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,380
We have a burden.

597
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,580
Habakkuk had a burden.

598
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,460
Paul had a burden.

599
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,980
In Romans chapter number 15, notice what Paul says nearing the end of this book.

600
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,980
Romans chapter 15 and verse 19.

601
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,780
In Romans 15 verse 19, through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of

602
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,380
God so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the

603
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:18,940
gospel of Christ, yea, so I have strived to preach the gospel now where Christ was named

604
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,140
lest I should build upon another man's foundation, but as it is written to whom he was not spoken

605
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,740
of, they shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.

606
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,260
We don't want to take the time to look at Romans 10 when Paul says, how shall they hear

607
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,140
without a preacher?

608
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,380
Listen this morning, we see that there's a plea for faithful ambassadors.

609
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,300
First from our loving Savior, then from a lost sinner.

610
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,620
We see there's a pattern for faithful ambassadors.

611
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,740
But I want you to see finally this morning, and we'll make it quick.

612
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:03,100
Chapter three this morning, a prize for faithful ambassadors, a prize for faithful ambassadors.

613
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:10,500
This morning as I begin to think about this truth and the understanding that one day I'll

614
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,340
see my Savior face to face, what a glorious day that will be.

615
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,060
But I would submit to you this morning that outside of your own salvation, the greatest

616
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,660
privilege of a Christian is to see a lost sinner bow their head and trust Christ as

617
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,020
their personal Savior.

618
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,340
Is absolutely glorious to have that opportunity.

619
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:40,700
If you've ever had that opportunity, you know how wonderful it is that God would allow you

620
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,500
to be the vessel.

621
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,980
You can't save anybody, I can't save anybody, Jesus is the Savior.

622
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:54,900
But He chose to use us as His ambassadors, and there's a prize.

623
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,620
The Bible speaks about crowns, and we understand this truth, but we look this morning and we

624
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,740
begin to understand the privilege of telling someone about Jesus.

625
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,940
And then when someone bows their head and their heart and they accept the Lord Jesus

626
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,860
Christ as their personal Savior, I mean, hallelujah, it is absolutely wonderful.

627
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,980
It's the greatest experience outside of your own personal salvation, your own personal

628
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,500
conversion that I believe you can have as a Christian.

629
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,180
It's awesome when you would have the privilege of seeing that.

630
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:33,140
When we begin to think about this prize, I would say that there's a two-fold aspect of

631
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,460
the prize for faithful ambassadors.

632
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,220
The first aspect would be that we're pleasing our Savior today.

633
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,780
We're pleasing our Savior today.

634
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,380
If you're a faithful ambassador, then God is pleased with you.

635
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,980
We find that it is true that as we live our lives that we can live in such a way that

636
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,140
is pleasing to Him, and we understand that we can live in such a way that God is not

637
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
well-pleased.

638
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:02,220
And I believe this morning that having God's favor upon us and God being pleased with us

639
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,260
is a great reward.

640
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,460
I pray for God's favor.

641
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:12,460
But you understand that God's favor comes to those who are living in obedience.

642
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,060
I'm thankful that the Bible says the goodness of God leadeth to the repentance.

643
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,460
But the reality this morning is that God's hand of favor, His good hand of favor is upon

644
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:28,900
those that are living a life of obedience.

645
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:36,180
The second aspect of this prize for faithful ambassadors is seeing fruit in eternity.

646
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:42,420
I want you to understand this morning that as a faithful ambassador, again, it's God

647
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,500
who gives the increase.

648
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,660
But I would argue that if you're not actively planting and watering, you're probably not

649
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,660
going to be the one that's going to see the increase, even though God's the one that gives

650
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
it.

651
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:03,620
So as you're engaged in that ministry of giving and being a faithful ambassador, what joy

652
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,700
to think about seeing fruit in eternity.

653
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,980
I'm talking about being in heaven.

654
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,020
Listen, the most wonderful thing about heaven is seeing our Savior.

655
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,620
In fact, if our Savior's not there, it's not heaven.

656
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,700
That's what people talk about the streets of gold and listen, what makes heaven heaven

657
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,620
is the presence of our Savior.

658
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,460
We understand that this morning.

659
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:34,900
But can you imagine having the privilege of seeing someone else in heaven for all of eternity

660
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:43,540
because God allowed you to be the vessel to share Christ with them?

661
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,740
That's awesome to think about that, that there'd be others in heaven.

662
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,260
Listen, if you've ever led someone to Christ, if you've ever had the opportunity to see

663
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,540
I can think if I can see images in my head right now of people that one day I will see

664
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,060
in heaven, that God allowed me.

665
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,580
I'm going to see a lot of people in heaven, but there's some people that I'm going to

666
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:11,260
see that God let me personally be involved in seeing them saved.

667
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,540
That's awesome.

668
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,940
That's awesome.

669
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:26,180
In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, notice what Paul says as he's writing to this church.

670
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,300
It's a church that Paul had the privilege of being able to go and preach the gospel

671
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,060
in the city of Thessalonica and people got saved and there's great persecution and opposition

672
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,420
and all those things going on.

673
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,180
But now as Paul is writing back to this church in Thessalonica, notice what the Bible says

674
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,020
in verse 19, and we're catching the very end of this chapter in the thought here, but

675
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:54,580
notice he says, for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing, notice this, are not

676
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:02,980
even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ that is coming, for ye are our glory

677
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,980
and joy.

678
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,300
You know what I think Paul had in his mind as he's writing, obviously in the inspiration

679
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,980
of the Holy Spirit of God, I believe that he had in his mind and in his heart as he's

680
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,900
writing these verses that there are going to be people that he has the privilege of

681
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:20,100
seeing in glory because they got saved.

682
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,940
Why did they get saved?

683
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,180
Because the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

684
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,660
But how did they hear?

685
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,260
They had to have a preacher.

686
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,180
Paul understood he was an apostle, but he understood he was an ambassador.

687
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,900
And Paul went to Thessalonica and he went there and he preached the gospel and people

688
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,720
got saved.

689
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:46,760
God used him as the instrument, as the vessel to give them the gospel.

690
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,400
And Paul says, you're our glory and our joy.

691
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,600
I wonder this morning, is there anyone in your mind that you can see at this moment

692
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,360
that you'll see in heaven?

693
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,960
Because God allowed you the opportunity to share the gospel with them and they got saved.

694
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,720
I hope that there's several that you can see.

695
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,280
The prize for faithful ambassadors.

696
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm going to remind you of a song.

697
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,360
We read some of it a few weeks ago when Brother Gardner was here on that Sunday night.

698
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,040
The title of the song is, Have I Done My Best for Jesus?

699
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,960
But I just want you to think this morning about the first two lines of the chorus for

700
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
that song.

701
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,280
Of course, as we sing the songs, we sing the verse and then the chorus, the verse, the

702
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,640
chorus, the verse, the chorus, the chorus is sung repeatedly.

703
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,880
The first two lines of the chorus of that great hymn are this.

704
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,500
How many are the lost that I have lifted?

705
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,780
How many are the lost that I have lifted?

706
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,180
It's what the songwriter wrote.

707
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:11,740
The second line says this, how many are the chained I've helped to free?

708
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,380
I can't save anyone and neither can you.

709
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,840
But God chose to use us.

710
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,140
And here's the reality this morning, if you're saved by the grace of God, if you're saved

711
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:28,180
by the grace of God, you're an ambassador.

712
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,260
If you're not saved this morning, you need to be saved because you're lost and like the

713
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,740
rich man in Luke 16, you're going to spend eternity in a lake of fire because of your

714
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
sin.

715
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,300
It's not because God doesn't love you, it's because of your sin.

716
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,240
The wage of sin is death.

717
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,580
God loves you so much that He sent Jesus to die for you, to pay for your sin so that you

718
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,500
could be saved and He wants you to be reconciled.

719
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,340
But this morning, if you're saved, you're an ambassador.

720
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,140
The question is this, what kind of an ambassador?

721
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:08,940
am I? And only you can answer the question. Only I can answer the question for myself.

722
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,660
What kind of an ambassador am I? Because the wise man under the inspirational Holy Spirit

723
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:25,320
of God in Proverbs said, a faithful ambassador bringeth health. Oh, that God would help us

724
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:31,860
to be faithful ambassadors. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for

725
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:38,360
loving us. We thank you for the truth of your word. And God, I pray that in these moments

726
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,560
of invitation that you'd have your will in way. God, I've made it clear already the questions

727
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:50,720
that ought to be pondered. So now we trust you to work in hearts and lives as only you

728
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,880
can. If there's one lost, I pray they'd come. We could take a Bible and trust Christ today.

729
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:06,200
I pray for those that are saved. We are ambassadors. What kind of an ambassador am I? Lord, have

730
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,200
your will in way. Work as only you can. We'll thank you for it in Christ's name, we pray.

731
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,840
Would you stand with me? Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. As she does,

732
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,720
the altar is open. If the Lord spoke to you this morning, the altar is open. Do business

733
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,320
with God.
