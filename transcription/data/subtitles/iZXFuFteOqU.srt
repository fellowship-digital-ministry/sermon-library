1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,059
pairing, and I certainly appreciate all of the hard work,

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,659
and appreciate Ron and Mady doing the decorations.

3
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:08,239
They were here late last night finishing up,

4
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,880
and always appreciate them doing the decorations

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,479
here in the church, and certainly thankful,

6
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:15,640
as I mentioned, Brother Ron is traveling,

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,840
and he's heading down to Georgia.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
Take your Bibles.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,239
I know I have Acts chapter 20,

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,000
but I want you to start in the book

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,440
of 1 Corinthians chapter number nine.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,200
We're gonna look at a few passages of scripture

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,360
before we find our way to Acts chapter number 20

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,920
this morning, and so eventually we'll get there.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
Last week, we had the opportunity,

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,200
as we gathered together, to be challenged

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
to evaluate our service to the Lord,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,939
and we considered this thought last week.

19
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,880
For the audience of one, we must remember

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,119
that our service is indeed for the audience of one.

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,919
It's for the Lord Jesus Christ,

22
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,180
and that at the same time, we understand

23
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,959
that it will have an impact on many,

24
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,919
and I begin to think about that truth,

25
00:00:56,919 --> 00:01:00,680
and as we examined that portion of scripture last week,

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,319
and really understanding that God has called us

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,480
to be his servants, and what a great privilege it is

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,519
to serve the Lord, that we singularly are seeking

29
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,160
to serve Christ for the audience of one,

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,760
but there are many that will be impacted by our service.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,199
There are people that are watching us,

32
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:22,559
people that are observing us, people that will be influenced

33
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,559
and impacted by our service, may I say it this way,

34
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,800
or lack thereof, amen, and people are watching,

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,199
and people are certainly seeing the example

36
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:35,680
that we are setting, and our service is

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,360
for the audience of one, it's for the Lord Jesus Christ,

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,680
seeking to please him alone, but many will be impacted.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,519
I believe that as you study the New Testament,

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,720
you would agree with me that the Lord used

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,160
the apostle Paul in a variety of ways.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
In fact, as you read through the New Testament,

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,120
you'll find that God chose to record many details

44
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,000
about the life of Paul.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,879
We had the privilege of reading through the book of Acts,

46
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,000
we'll be in Acts chapter number 20 here shortly.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,519
We had the opportunity to read in the book of Acts

48
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,120
various aspects of the missionary journeys

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,880
that God allowed for the apostle Paul to go on.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,039
We find that as we read the New Testament books

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,039
that God would use several of them,

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,399
the human penman, he would use Paul to pen those books,

53
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,500
and through those books, we have the opportunity

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,940
to not only learn about the ministry of the apostle Paul

55
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,220
and how he was ministering to others and encouraging them,

56
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,820
but also we have the opportunity to evaluate

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,059
his own service to the Lord.

58
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,940
And we find that as we study the New Testament,

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,139
and again, as we have the opportunity to study

60
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,759
the life of the apostle Paul in the New Testament,

61
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,979
I believe this morning, truly, the apostle Paul

62
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,960
served for the audience of one.

63
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,580
He served the Lord Jesus Christ.

64
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,259
He was not interested in pleasing certain groups of people,

65
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,259
as he would go from place to place and minister.

66
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,860
He was serving the Lord Jesus Christ

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,940
for the audience of one.

68
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,779
I believe truly this morning

69
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,779
that the apostle Paul had the desire,

70
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,940
in fact, we'll see it in Acts chapter number 20,

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,520
that he would finish his race, his course with joy,

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,779
that he would hear, well done thou good and faithful servant

73
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:13,139
and that he would finish what God had called him to do.

74
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,139
I believe that he had that aspect or that perspective

75
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,660
for the audience of one,

76
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,460
but it's obviously clear, abundantly clear,

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,139
as you read through the New Testament,

78
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,740
that his service not only was pleasing to God,

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,139
but it has impacted generations of believers.

80
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,979
Not only those in the first century that knew

81
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,460
and Paul ministered to them personally,

82
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,259
but for centuries now, we've had the complete canon

83
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,460
of the New Testament, of God's word,

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,860
and we have the New Testament, and as we study,

85
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,899
as we dig into the New Testament, still to this very day,

86
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,460
the life and service of the apostle Paul

87
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,539
is impacting scores of believers,

88
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,600
and for that, we ought to be thankful.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,820
You think about your life,

90
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,259
and obviously, as God gives us life,

91
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,500
it's just but for a moment.

92
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,580
James says it this way, what is your life?

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,940
It appears for a little time and then vanisheth away,

94
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,800
and we understand that to be true.

95
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,380
We understand the brevity of life,

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,539
and as we begin to think about the brevity of life

97
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,440
and thinking about how God would use us in our lifetime

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,040
to serve him and to impact individuals,

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,519
but then to consider that God will allow our lives

100
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,079
after we leave this earth

101
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,279
to continue to impact generations.

102
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,320
That's amazing, and that's certainly something

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,040
that God can do in and through each of our lives.

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,559
As we look at a few of these passages

105
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,600
starting in 1 Corinthians 9,

106
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,519
I believe in these few passages that we're gonna read

107
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,540
as we lay the groundwork for getting

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,660
to Acts chapter number 20,

109
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,940
that really in these portions of scripture

110
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,739
starting in 1 Corinthians 9,

111
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,459
God provides us with a record

112
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,700
of really Paul's approach to serving the Lord.

113
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,540
What was it that shaped the ministry of the apostle Paul?

114
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,100
What was it that gave him the framework,

115
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,880
the philosophy of ministry, if you will?

116
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,100
Why is it that we speak of and look at the New Testament

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,339
and see the service of Paul

118
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:17,100
and say this is commendable and noteworthy

119
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,779
and exemplary, his service to God?

120
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,260
Well, I believe that God gives us some insight

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,920
as we'll see in a few of these passages.

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,059
Notice in 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 23,

123
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,140
the Bible says this,

124
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,380
Paul is speaking to these believers in Corinth,

125
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,779
and he says, and this I do for the gospel's sake.

126
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,459
If you were to look back into the chapter,

127
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,140
you find verse number 16

128
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,619
about the responsibility of preaching the gospel

129
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,660
and that God had called him to this,

130
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,059
and he says, this I do for the gospel's sake,

131
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:46,100
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

132
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,820
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

133
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,940
but one receiveth the prize.

134
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,980
He says this, so run that ye may obtain.

135
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,140
That phrase is the phrase that I've used

136
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,700
for our title of our message this morning,

137
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,040
so run that ye may obtain.

138
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,140
He says in verse 25,

139
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,220
and every man that striveth for the mastery

140
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,839
is temperate in all things.

141
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,059
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,

142
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,299
but notice we, an incorruptible.

143
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,380
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly,

144
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,859
so fight I not as one that beateth the air,

145
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,380
but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection,

146
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,059
lest that by any means, when I have preached to others,

147
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,619
I myself should be a castaway.

148
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:31,100
That idea is really to be useless or of no value,

149
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,220
and Paul is saying, I do this for the gospel's sake,

150
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,140
thinking about the audience of one,

151
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,959
but also that I might be partaker thereof with you,

152
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,279
the impact that it would have on many.

153
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,000
And he says, this I do, this is my approach,

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,519
this is how I'm serving the Lord, why?

155
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,600
Because I'm running that I might obtain.

156
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,079
So run that ye may obtain.

157
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,799
He tells that to the believers at Corinth,

158
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,839
but Paul himself, I believe,

159
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,640
is seeking to serve the Lord in that manner.

160
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,260
A familiar verse of scripture to us is Galatians 2,

161
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,420
if you turn over to that portion of scripture

162
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,959
in Galatians chapter number two,

163
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,959
and we find that Paul gives this great climatic statement,

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,920
if you will, with regard to his view of his own self

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
and his ministry to the Lord

166
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,880
and understanding his place of service.

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,640
He says in Galatians 2 in verse number 20,

168
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,959
I am crucified with Christ.

169
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,200
Nevertheless, I live.

170
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,959
Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,

171
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,839
and the life which I now live in the flesh,

172
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,279
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me

173
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,160
and gave himself for me.

174
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,720
The Apostle Paul was living the crucified life

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,600
as we've often referred to it as,

176
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,760
and we find that he was all in,

177
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,920
he was surrendered to the Lord,

178
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,359
and we begin to think about his surrender

179
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:53,399
and his service to Christ and how he understood.

180
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,320
And again, as we begin to look at these few passages

181
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,420
to develop and understand the framework,

182
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,079
the approach that the Apostle Paul

183
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,920
to have in his service to the Lord,

184
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,239
it will help us as we too serve the Lord.

185
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,079
The book of Philippians,

186
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,760
just a few pages over in your Bible,

187
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,200
Philippians chapter number three.

188
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,260
In Philippians chapter number three,

189
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,480
we really could read verses four through 14,

190
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,239
but for sake of time, I want you to jot that passage down

191
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,040
so that you could read the entirety of it.

192
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,619
For sake of time, I'm gonna pick it up

193
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,279
in verse number 11 down through verse number 14.

194
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,679
But again, notice the approach

195
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,559
that Paul has in serving the Lord.

196
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,960
He says this in verse number 11 of Philippians three,

197
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,960
if by any means I might attain

198
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,119
unto the resurrection of the dead,

199
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,880
not as though I had already attained,

200
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,679
either were already perfect.

201
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,520
In other words, I have not arrived,

202
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,239
neither have you, neither have I.

203
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,799
He says, but I follow after,

204
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,200
if that I may apprehend that

205
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,239
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

206
00:08:56,239 --> 00:09:00,080
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

207
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,599
but this one thing I do,

208
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,640
forgetting those things which are behind

209
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,520
and reaching forth unto those things which are before.

210
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,599
I press, do you see the imagery that God gives us

211
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,400
as Paul is sharing his approach to ministry?

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,679
I press toward the mark

213
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,200
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,340
He's not being, if it's convenient, if it's comfortable.

215
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,000
No, he says, I'm pressing toward the mark,

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,840
so run that you may obtain.

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,880
He shares that in First Corinthians nine.

218
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
He says here in Philippians three

219
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,000
that he is seeking and following after the Lord.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,640
He wants to apprehend that

221
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,880
for which he was apprehended of Christ.

222
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,599
He wants to press toward the mark

223
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,479
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

224
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:48,039
One day, each of us will stand,

225
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,400
if you're saved this morning,

226
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,359
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

227
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,559
as your personal Savior,

228
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,119
you will stand at the judgment seat of Christ.

229
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:58,359
And I'm looking forward to the opportunity,

230
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,000
Lord willing to hear, well done,

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,960
good and faithful servant, and to receive crowns of service.

232
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,039
Remember, it's God who has enabled us,

233
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,140
who has equipped us, who has called us,

234
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,340
but then he rewards us for serving him.

235
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,680
It's an amazing truth of God's word.

236
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
And I hope this morning that each of us

237
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,319
would have that understanding

238
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:17,819
that when I stand before the Lord,

239
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:20,920
that I would not have that wood, hay, and stubble

240
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,120
that will be burned up,

241
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,459
but that we'd have that silver, gold, and precious stone

242
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,260
that we would serve the Lord acceptably,

243
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
that we would serve him faithfully.

244
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,799
And we find here that the Apostle Paul,

245
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,919
this is what he's doing.

246
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,099
He's pressing toward the mark.

247
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,939
Again, if you would think about the imagery,

248
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,259
you see someone who is constant and consistent.

249
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,540
Notice one final passage, 2 Timothy chapter four,

250
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,599
before we get to the book of Acts.

251
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,979
In 2 Timothy chapter number four,

252
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,720
it's a familiar portion of scripture.

253
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,279
Paul, this is the last letter

254
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,880
that God would use the Apostle Paul to pen

255
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,840
before he would be martyred for the faith.

256
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,639
And he's writing it to his son in the faith.

257
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,680
He's writing it to Timothy.

258
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,559
He's seeking to influence and instruct

259
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,599
and to encourage Timothy to continue to serve the Lord

260
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,639
and to finish his course, to finish his race.

261
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,519
But Paul says in 2 Timothy four and verse number six,

262
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,819
for I am now ready to be offered.

263
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,160
So Paul's ministry has come to an end.

264
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,879
It's come to a conclusion.

265
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,440
He understands that the time of his departure is at hand.

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,720
It was not just that he was going to depart

267
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,919
from a particular location in that his ministry

268
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,160
in that locale was completed.

269
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,879
No, it was that he was going to go home.

270
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,199
Remember, he said in 2 Corinthians,

271
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,519
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

272
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,639
Paul understood that this was the end

273
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,440
of his earthly ministry, the end of his earthly life.

274
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
He would soon face a martyr's death.

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
He says, the time of my departure is at hand.

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,459
But notice he says, I have fought a good fight.

277
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,940
I have finished my course.

278
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,080
I have kept the faith.

279
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,919
Oh, that God wouldn't allow each of us

280
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,500
at the end of our lives to be able to say

281
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,959
what Paul says in verse number seven,

282
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,419
that it would not be, I wish I would have.

283
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,120
If only I would have, if I could change this.

284
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,259
No, I don't want to have those types of regrets.

285
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,460
And we see that Paul, he was not perfect,

286
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,820
but he was a man who was surrendered to the Lord.

287
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,660
He was a man who was committed to serving Christ.

288
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,259
And he says, I have fought a good fight.

289
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,720
I have finished my course.

290
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,660
I have kept the faith.

291
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,020
Notice verse number eight, henceforth,

292
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,820
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

293
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,740
Remember, we said in First Corinthians nine,

294
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,440
he says, they run to obtain a corruptible,

295
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,740
but we an incorruptible.

296
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,580
He says, so run that ye may obtain.

297
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,220
And Paul had this, this isn't pride,

298
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,479
but he has this confidence that there is laid up for him,

299
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:47,380
for me, a crown of righteousness.

300
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,779
There are five crowns that are mentioned

301
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,619
in the New Testament.

302
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,300
We won't take time to deal with that this morning,

303
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,539
but this is one of the five.

304
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,839
He says, a crown of righteousness,

305
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,860
notice, which the Lord, the righteous judge,

306
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,740
by the way, he is a righteous judge,

307
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,059
shall give me at that day.

308
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:04,139
But notice the end of the verse.

309
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,979
And not to me only, but unto all them also

310
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,539
that love his appearing.

311
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,320
So this morning, just as the apostle Paul

312
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,759
could have confidence of receiving this crown,

313
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,139
as he said that he was pressing toward that mark,

314
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,100
he wanted to receive that well done.

315
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,179
And we find that he says,

316
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,860
there is a crown of righteousness that the Lord,

317
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,220
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.

318
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,539
So this morning, as we begin to think about our service

319
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,160
to the Lord, as we consider last week's message

320
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,539
for the audience of one,

321
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,800
we understand that God has called us

322
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,979
and God has equipped us and we're serving the Lord,

323
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,619
but it will have an impact on many.

324
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,899
I look to Acts chapter number 20.

325
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,419
And in Acts chapter number 20,

326
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,220
we have the opportunity to see and to read

327
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,419
of an interaction between the apostle Paul

328
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,339
and the church leaders of the church at Ephesus.

329
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,419
The apostle Paul, historically,

330
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,139
at this particular time in his life,

331
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,380
in Acts chapter number 20, he's on his way to Jerusalem.

332
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,500
And as he's heading towards Jerusalem,

333
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,940
he's really going and traveling with haste

334
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,660
because he's desiring to be there at the day of Pentecost.

335
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,820
And because of that, he would not have opportunity

336
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,299
within his schedule to stop in at Ephesus

337
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,920
and have any interaction with those church leaders.

338
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:20,459
So what does he do?

339
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,880
He calls for those church leaders to meet him.

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,480
And here is the conversation that God records for us

341
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,440
between the apostle Paul and the church leaders at Ephesus.

342
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,880
And in this particular portion of scripture,

343
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,320
this few verses we're gonna look at this morning,

344
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I believe that God gives us four aspects of Paul's service

345
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
that would be helpful for each of us today

346
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,480
to be able to apply in our own lives.

347
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,519
Notice the Bible says, beginning in Acts chapter number 20

348
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,000
and verse number 17, and from Miletus,

349
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,799
he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.

350
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,119
And when they were come to him, he said unto them,

351
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,720
and so Paul was addressing these church leaders.

352
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,200
He's going to share personal testimony of his own ministry,

353
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,839
but then he's gonna encourage them

354
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,119
with regard to their service to Christ

355
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:12,200
and their time that they have to minister.

356
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,359
And he says this in verse number 18,

357
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,559
ye know from the first day that I came into Asia

358
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,760
after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,

359
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,679
serving the Lord with all humility of mind

360
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,119
and with many tears and temptations,

361
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,920
which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews,

362
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,

363
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,239
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

364
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:39,519
and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews

365
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,239
and also to the Greeks repentance toward God

366
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:45,040
and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,640
And now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,

368
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,880
not knowing the things that shall befall me there,

369
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,320
save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city

370
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

371
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,079
Verse 24, but none of these things move me,

372
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,359
neither count I my life dear unto myself,

373
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:06,959
so that I might finish my course with joy

374
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,399
in the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

375
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,679
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

376
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,160
And now behold, I know that ye all among whom

377
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,920
I have gone preaching the kingdom of God

378
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,679
shall see my face no more.

379
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,079
Wherefore, I take you to record this day

380
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,559
that I am pure from the blood of all men,

381
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,279
for I have not shunned to declare unto you

382
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,239
all the counsel of God.

383
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,239
So verse 27 concludes Paul sharing at that point

384
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:34,399
his testimony of his service and rehearsing to them.

385
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,820
He's going to continue making some references,

386
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,019
but now he's addressing them,

387
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,640
these leaders of the church at Ephesus

388
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,000
with regard to their service.

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,220
Verse 28, take heed therefore unto yourselves

390
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,600
and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,079
hath made you overseers to feed the church of God

392
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,640
which he hath purchased with his own blood.

393
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,920
For I know this, that after my departing

394
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,119
shall grievous wolves enter in among you,

395
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,399
not sparing the flock, also of your own selves

396
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,559
shall men arise speaking perverse things

397
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,299
to draw away disciples after them.

398
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,720
Therefore, watch and remember that by the space

399
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,519
of three years, I, again he's speaking

400
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,179
about his own ministry, cease not to warn everyone

401
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,760
night and day with tears, and now brethren,

402
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,399
I commend you to God and to the word of his grace

403
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:22,720
which is able to build you up and to give you

404
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,480
an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.

405
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,980
I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel,

406
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,239
yea, ye yourselves know that these hands

407
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,440
have ministered unto my necessities

408
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,079
and to them that were with me.

409
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,880
I have showed you all things, so laboring

410
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,519
you ought to support the weak and to remember

411
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,279
the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said

412
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,880
it is more blessed to give than to receive.

413
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,320
Notice verse 36, and when he had thus spoken,

414
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,239
he kneeled down and prayed with them all.

415
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,279
So Paul addresses these believers,

416
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,000
these church leaders from Ephesus,

417
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,760
he calls them and they meet together,

418
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,859
and within this passage of scripture,

419
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,640
there's great truth that is revealed to us,

420
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,559
but I find four specific aspects of Paul's ministry

421
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,160
and how it is that in verse 24 he could say

422
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,920
that I might finish my course with joy,

423
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,640
and the ministry, notice, that I have received

424
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,440
of the Lord Jesus, he's given each of us a ministry.

425
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,760
Your ministry differs than Paul's ministry

426
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
and your ministry probably differs

427
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,079
than the person sitting around you,

428
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,640
but God has equipped us and he's called us

429
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,339
to serve him and Paul says I desire to finish

430
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,359
my course with joy, understanding that this ministry

431
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,880
has been given to me and trusted to me

432
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,000
by the Lord Jesus, and we find that he's able

433
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,760
to say at the end of his life, I have finished,

434
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,099
I've kept the faith, I've finished my course,

435
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,000
and he knew that there was a crown of righteousness,

436
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,099
so he says, and I believe that he believed this

437
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,880
for himself in First Corinthians nine,

438
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,679
so run that ye may obtain, he's saying that

439
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,400
to the believers in Corinth, he says it to himself,

440
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,099
probably to others as well, and understanding

441
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,859
this morning that Paul served the Lord,

442
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,299
if you're taking notes, number one,

443
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,900
he served the Lord humbly, humbly, he was a humble man.

444
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,020
Humility is necessary in our service to Christ.

445
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,880
It's absolutely essential.

446
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,619
Notice the Bible says in verse number 19,

447
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:23,619
serving the Lord with all humility of mind

448
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,340
and with many tears and temptations,

449
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,900
which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.

450
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Humility in service to the king is absolutely essential.

451
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,219
It's absolutely essential.

452
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:36,059
Why do we say that?

453
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,419
Well, because the Bible tells us

454
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,099
that God resisteth the proud,

455
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,580
but giveth grace unto the humble.

456
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,359
As we serve the Lord Jesus Christ,

457
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,780
we understand that it is he that has called us,

458
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,619
it is he that has equipped us, he has enabled us.

459
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,059
Paul said that he was thankful that God enabled him

460
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,700
and that he put him into the ministry,

461
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,859
and we find this morning that as Paul

462
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:59,340
is serving the Lord as we get some insight here

463
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,179
in Acts chapter.

464
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,099
20 with regard to his manner of service, we find that he served the Lord humbly.

465
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,779
Listen, this morning, it's essential. Notice in Philippians chapter number 2,

466
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:15,539
notice what Paul says as he's speaking to these believers in Philippi. Of course,

467
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,619
he's addressing there in Acts chapter number 20 the church leaders of Ephesus,

468
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,699
but I want you to see what Paul says about humility. As we look here in

469
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:28,259
Philippians chapter number 2, he says this in verse number 3 of Philippians 2,

470
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:33,339
let nothing be done. Now, if he says let nothing be done, that's pretty

471
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:37,619
all-inclusive, is it not? And so that certainly would include our service to

472
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:43,419
Christ. He says let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in

473
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,659
lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look, not every

474
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,539
man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. But then we find

475
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,019
in verse number 5, there's this great truth that Paul gives to these believers

476
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:59,939
at Philippi and to us by way of preservation. The Bible says let this

477
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:06,419
mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. You know, he is, the Lord Jesus

478
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:12,979
Christ is God. He's God. God in flesh. The beginning was the Word, and the Word was

479
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:17,819
with God, and the Word was God. Amen? And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,

480
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,859
tabernacled among us, John chapter number 1. And you see, and obviously there's a

481
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:27,899
variety of passages of Scripture that prove the deity of Christ. We celebrate

482
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:34,299
this time of year on our calendars, the Incarnation, the fact that God came to

483
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,739
this earth, and we find the deity of Christ, that He is God. Where is He that

484
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:45,179
is born? King of the Jews. They bowed down and worshipped Him, is what the Bible

485
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:54,939
tells us. Why? Because He's God. But He was humble. He humbled Himself. Now think

486
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:00,219
about that just for a moment. We're to serve the Lord humbly as Paul did, but we

487
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:04,819
find that Paul makes this approach an appeal to the church at Philippi. He says

488
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:08,500
let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. In verse number 8, he

489
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,019
says, being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto

490
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,259
death, even the death of the cross. Why? So that he could pay for your sins and

491
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:26,059
mine. And he humbled himself. He's the Creator God. You read John 17, and you

492
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,219
read about the glory that He had with the Father, and eternity passed, and yet

493
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,419
He left the glories of heaven, the splendor of heaven, to come to this

494
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:41,379
sin-cursed world so they could die for us. As we serve the Lord, we must also

495
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,739
serve Him humbly. We must understand this morning that it is easy for us to become

496
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:50,299
prideful. It is easy for us to become full of ourselves and to think that we're

497
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,539
something, but reality is that we're just sinners saved by grace. I'm thankful to be

498
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,299
a saint. I'm thankful that Christ is in me, and I'm in Him, and I'm thankful that

499
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,419
I'm heaven-bound, but we must serve the Lord with humility. First Peter says it

500
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,419
this way, that we're to be clothed with humility, and then a reference

501
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,219
that we see not only in First Peter 5, but also James 4, for God resisted the

502
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:18,259
proud and giveth grace to the humble. This morning as we serve the Lord, we

503
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:24,219
must serve Him humbly. Let me say this morning that Paul was a servant. He says

504
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:28,500
that I was serving the Lord with all humility of mind. We must not only serve

505
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,739
the Lord humbly as Paul did, but number two, we must serve the Lord

506
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:37,619
compassionately. Compassionately. Someone said, I'm not sure who it is, we've used

507
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,459
this phrase before, but often you'll find in life that people don't really

508
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:45,500
care how much you know until they know how much you care. No doubt you've heard

509
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,819
that at some point in your life, and we find that the Apostle Paul was a man who

510
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:54,179
served the Lord with compassion. He served the Lord compassionately. I would

511
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,139
understand this morning that even as our Lord was humble, our Lord too was

512
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:03,979
compassionate. Matthew 9 and verse 36 tells us that the Lord, He saw the

513
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:08,979
multitudes and He was moved with compassion. Why do we say that the

514
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:12,459
Apostle Paul served with compassion? Why did he serve the Lord compassionately?

515
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:16,179
Well, notice in verse 19 it says, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, but

516
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:21,380
notice, and with many tears. Skip down and look at verse 31. It says, therefore

517
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,660
watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone

518
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,619
night and day with what? With tears. Why Paul? Why do you have tears, Paul? Well,

519
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:35,660
because Paul understood the fact that every person that he came into contact

520
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,859
with was going to spend eternity in the lake of fire if they did not trust the

521
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,539
Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, and he was compassionate. He

522
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,660
cared about people. I mean this statement as we studied on Wednesday nights going

523
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,139
through the book of Ruth, how that we learned from Boaz that he was a man who

524
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:56,059
took interest in individuals. He was a man who stopped even in the busyness of

525
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,139
his life and all the responsibilities that he had to be able to care

526
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:05,739
about people. And this morning we see that Paul was a man that served the Lord

527
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:13,299
compassionately, compassionately. You know, sometimes we get branded as not being

528
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:21,220
compassionate, not really caring, but the reality is that we should be the ones

529
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,459
that care the most because we know the truth. As I begin to think about the

530
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,779
truth of compassion and the importance for you and for me this morning to be

531
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:36,539
compassionate in our service to Christ, we're mindful of the fact that we are

532
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:42,259
seeking to reach individuals that have been influenced. Listen, they're lost. The

533
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,380
God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not. When we think

534
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,019
about sharing the gospel with people, we understand that we at times we're called

535
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,779
to minister to people that oppose themselves. Paul speaks of that in 1st

536
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,979
Timothy and that we're to do it with meekness, the Bible says. And here we find

537
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:03,459
that Paul, he's serving the Lord compassionately. We begin to think about

538
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:09,179
the ministry of the Apostle Paul. We begin to look at the impact that Paul

539
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:14,779
had and how God used the Apostle Paul to not only bring honor and glory to Christ

540
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,259
and he's serving the Lord Christ as a singular focus for the audience of one,

541
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,299
but generations of believers have been influenced and impacted by the ministry

542
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,299
of the Apostle Paul. So what is it about his approach to ministry that is

543
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:34,539
exemplary for us that we could say that too is the manner by which we should

544
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:39,380
serve the Lord? Because if he served the Lord and he pleased God, and if he served

545
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,660
the Lord and he made an impact, then I can learn from his approach to service and I

546
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,899
can adopt in my own life how I too can serve Christ so that I can be pleasing

547
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:54,259
to the Lord and so that I can impact. Does that make sense? And so we find that

548
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,820
he served the Lord humbly, he served the Lord compassionately. Look if you will

549
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,699
in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 2. Often we've said as we've studied through

550
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:08,459
the New Testament that there's no perfect church. By the way, this church is not a

551
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:13,500
perfect church. There are no perfect churches, but we serve a perfect God.

552
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,899
We have a perfect book. Amen? We're imperfect people, but we have a perfect

553
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:25,419
God and a perfect book and we seek to do all things in honor and glory to our God.

554
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:29,579
There's no perfect church. The church in Thessalonica is a model church,

555
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:33,380
no doubt. As you look throughout the New Testament, you have the opportunity to see

556
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,619
a number of different churches. You'll find that some churches are not model

557
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:40,699
churches. The church at Corinth is probably the top of that list of this is

558
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:44,979
not a model church. There's some things you can learn about their behavior and

559
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:50,100
their actions of not to do, not to incorporate in your ministry. But when we

560
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,579
think about the church at Thessalonica, we find that they're a model church and

561
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,940
there's much about this church that we can have the opportunity to say there's

562
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,459
some things that we can learn and apply from our lives. But as we think about the

563
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:04,419
church in Thessalonica and we think about their influence in the place that

564
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,660
they have of being a model church, we find that within the content of this

565
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,820
first letter that Paul reveals to us his compassion, his compassionate

566
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,259
approach. When he comes to Thessalonica, just like as he had gone to other cities

567
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:22,579
during his ministries, during his missionary journeys, it was often met

568
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:28,820
with some contention. It was often met with opposition. We find that such was

569
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,979
the case even in Thessalonica, but we find that the Bible tells us, notice in

570
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:35,140
1 Thessalonians 2, in verse number 5, the Bible says,

571
00:28:35,140 --> 00:29:00,339
Isn't that a great verse of Scripture?

572
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:06,940
Paul, you were handling the Word of life, you were handling the Word of God, you were

573
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,940
handling eternal matters. Yes, but I was compassionate. I came in humbly. Notice

574
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,339
it says that we sought not glory in verse number 6, nor of men sought we glory,

575
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:23,219
neither of you nor yet of others. And we find that he was humble, but he also says

576
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:28,739
that he came in and he was gentle among them. And then he uses this imagery that

577
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,700
we find at the end of verse number 7 that's so impactful, where the Bible says,

578
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,219
Even as a nurse cherisheth her children. And Paul says that was our approach to

579
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:47,260
ministry. We're compassionate. Verse number 8, So being affectionately desirous

580
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:53,059
of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but

581
00:29:53,059 --> 00:30:00,580
also our own souls. Why? Because ye were dear unto us.

582
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,260
I wonder this morning, as we evaluate our ministry and our service to God,

583
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,500
I wonder, are we serving Christ humbly?

584
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,100
I wonder this morning, are we serving Christ compassionately?

585
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,220
Are there people in your life and in my life that know that we care about them?

586
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,980
That we're gentle, that they know that they're dear unto us?

587
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,380
Listen, I'm not suggesting that we change our message.

588
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm not suggesting that we compromise on what thus saith the Lord,

589
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,620
because God's word is true, and we must stand on the precepts of God's word,

590
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,820
and I believe ultimately that being loving is speaking the truth.

591
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,540
It is not very compassionate of me to see somebody that's opposing themselves,

592
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,940
that's living in disobedience, that's following after whatever they're following after,

593
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,460
and me to just put my arm around them and say,

594
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,100
love you man, everything's going to be okay.

595
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,260
That's not really love, would you agree this morning?

596
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,940
But I can put my arm around them and say,

597
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,860
listen, can I share with you the truth of God's word?

598
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,540
It's amazing when we begin to think about the power that God has given us in His word,

599
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,220
and the power of compassion.

600
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,580
Listen, when people understand that you actually care about them, that you love them,

601
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,420
that we can show the love of Christ.

602
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,700
By the way, you can't do that in your own power, in your own flesh.

603
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,420
You can only do that through the power and work of the Holy Spirit of God.

604
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,380
It's the only way to do it.

605
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,980
And we love people, and we show that compassion.

606
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,460
What a blessing to think about Paul's ministry and his service.

607
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,180
We see in Acts 20 that he served the Lord humbly, he served the Lord compassionately.

608
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,580
Let me say this, Paul served, number three, Paul served the Lord passionately, passionately.

609
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,020
You know, I'm thankful for some passionate people.

610
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,060
I remember one time somebody saying to me, this is probably 11 years ago,

611
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,620
I've been here for almost 12 and a half years, probably 11 years ago.

612
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,940
And it was a teenager, Luke is probably a little bit older than you.

613
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,620
But I remember he just struggled coming to church, and I was trying to talk to him.

614
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,500
And he said this, he said, well, the Bible's just boring.

615
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,740
That's what he said to me.

616
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,420
I said, well, let me ask you this.

617
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,660
Do you think that I think the Bible's boring?

618
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,580
Oh, no, I don't think you think the Bible's boring.

619
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,060
I mean, you're like passionate about this stuff.

620
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,980
That was, I was glad to hear that.

621
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,220
Why?

622
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,420
Because the Bible's not boring.

623
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,340
And what that young man saw was somebody that actually believed what they were preaching.

624
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,780
They're passionate about it.

625
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
You've met people that are passionate.

626
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,860
We joke sometimes with the Fesdections that everything that Zachary does, he does with

627
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,340
all of his being.

628
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,940
Pierre, amen and amen, right?

629
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,700
I mean, he's all in.

630
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,380
I got pictures of Zachary.

631
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,620
When he's throwing water balloons at VBS this past year.

632
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,980
And I mean, I don't know who took the picture, but I mean, it captured perfectly in one shot

633
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,540
all of the passion of Zachary.

634
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,060
Listen, we ought to be passionate in our service for Christ.

635
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,300
People ought to know that we truly believe the message that we're proclaiming and that

636
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
we're passionate about it.

637
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,420
Notice in verse number 20 of Acts 20, the Bible says this.

638
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,100
Why do I say that Paul was passionate?

639
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,980
Well, it says that in how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

640
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,180
Now, can I pause just for a moment and can I tell you this morning that we have been

641
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:36,740
called to deliver a message that is profitable to people that often do not know that the

642
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,860
message is profitable?

643
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,260
Do you understand what I just said?

644
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:50,500
God has called us to deliver a message that is profitable to people who often do not know

645
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,420
that that message is profitable.

646
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,460
But still, we're called to proclaim the message.

647
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,660
He says that he held back, I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

648
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,860
Notice as you look at verse 21, he says, testifying both of the Jews and also to the

649
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,100
Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

650
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,300
He's preaching this message of salvation, and he's preaching it, I believe, with passion.

651
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,780
As you look at the Apostle Paul, as he travels from one town to the next town to the next

652
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,620
town, from one city to the next, he's facing opposition and he's facing persecution, and

653
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,220
yet he's going in and he's preaching, and I believe, with passion.

654
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,180
We find that in verse 29 and 30, he gives us some insight as he's giving the instruction

655
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,660
to the church leaders of Ephesus with regard to their ministry and feeding the church of

656
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,220
God.

657
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,580
He says this in verse 29 and 30, for I know this, that after my departing shall grievous

658
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,940
wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock, also of your own selves shall men arise

659
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,860
speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.

660
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,340
Therefore, we should be passionate about our ministry.

661
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,460
Listen, do you want, think about the imagery, as you understand the Bible gives us the imagery

662
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,660
that we're sheep, he's the shepherd, the pastor has been called as an under-shepherd,

663
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,740
if we could use that terminology, and he says that there are going to be some grievous wolves

664
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,620
that are going to come in and they're not going to spare the flock.

665
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,340
We've got to be passionate.

666
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,660
Can I tell you this morning that the other side is passionate?

667
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,780
The other side is passionate?

668
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,780
They're passionate about what they believe.

669
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,500
They're passionate, and sometimes we just sit on the sidelines and serve God with passion.

670
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,660
Listen, compassionately, but with passion.

671
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,380
I'm thankful that God's given us truth.

672
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,660
I'm thankful that I know the truth and I can be passionate about it.

673
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,220
Notice this interaction.

674
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,180
If you turn to Acts 26, we're going to jump right in the middle of the context of the

675
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,900
passage of Scripture, but so that we can understand what's happening, Paul is giving a defense

676
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,340
here before Agrippa.

677
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,180
He's given a defense before Festus already and Felix and what have you, and he's had

678
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,940
this opportunity, and he's standing before and giving testimony, and here in Acts 26,

679
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,380
he's standing before Agrippa.

680
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,100
And as he's standing before Agrippa, again, we won't take the time, we don't have the

681
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,140
time to go through all that Paul is speaking to him, but he's preaching, he's giving

682
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,900
the truth about his own testimony of salvation and conversion, and notice if we jump in at

683
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:36,580
verse number 24, and as he thus spake for himself, so Paul is preaching, I mean, I think

684
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,380
he's preaching with passion, he's sharing the truth with Agrippa, and others are there.

685
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,620
The Bible says that Festus stands up with a loud voice.

686
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,780
Notice it says, Paul, thou art beside thyself.

687
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,740
Much learning doth make thee mad.

688
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,300
Crazy.

689
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,860
Festus is in opposition to what Paul is saying, but I think that as Paul was standing there

690
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:05,460
before Agrippa and that group of dignitaries that were gathered, that Paul was speaking

691
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,340
with passion.

692
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,700
I believe that Festus was under conviction, no doubt Agrippa too will be under conviction

693
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,100
as we look here at this text of Scripture, but we find that Paul, he says in verse number

694
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:22,900
25 as he responds to Festus, he says, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth

695
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,340
the words of truth and soberness.

696
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,740
And we ought to be passionate about it.

697
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,740
Listen, there are still people today, believe it or not, that are passionate about the football

698
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,700
team in Washington.

699
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,020
I don't know how many years they've lost for.

700
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,020
I don't know that they've ever had a winning record since I've lived here, all right?

701
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,020
I remember when I first moved here, and I'm not a huge sports fan.

702
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,700
I liked sports a whole lot more years ago than I do now, but the reality is that when

703
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,740
I first moved here, there were people, okay, what team are you going to follow?

704
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,580
And we don't have a real big population of folks in our congregation that are really

705
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,820
avid sports fans, but there are people, I don't even know if Washington's playing at

706
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,540
home or away today, but there will be people at the game today that will color themselves

707
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,500
in paint that spent way too much money to go and buy a ticket.

708
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,180
They're going to sit there, if it's local, they're going to sit here in nasty weather,

709
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,860
and they're going to be passionately cheering for a losing team.

710
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,020
Am I right?

711
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Should we not be passionate for our cause?

712
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,619
Should we not have passion as we proclaim the message that Jesus is Lord?

713
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,700
I remember sitting in England, Liverpool, England.

714
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,020
I love the Clemens, great friends, missionaries that we've supported for years.

715
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,100
They've sat at our table, great friends.

716
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,299
But I remember Joseph was there.

717
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,299
He's the only one in the auditorium that was there with us.

718
00:38:57,299 --> 00:39:01,059
I remember serving and getting there for that Sunday at Breck Road Baptist Church,

719
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
and I remember going in there and we stood up to sing.

720
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,980
Man, I was ready to sing like we sing here.

721
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,179
And within the first two verses, I found...

722
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,580
Not two verses, two measures.

723
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,140
I found out that no one was singing anywhere near as close to what my volume was.

724
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,980
And I kind of had to tone it down and had to kind of...

725
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,220
And it's very formal.

726
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,780
That's just their worship, very formal.

727
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,500
And I remember talking to Brother Clemens.

728
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,980
He said,

729
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,059
English people aren't very passionate.

730
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,619
And I'm not criticizing Brother Clemens.

731
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:38,900
Don't misunderstand my point.

732
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,580
And it's very, this is just how we worship.

733
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,140
That's fine.

734
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,540
But I said to Brother Clemens, I said, well, how do you describe when they're watching

735
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,500
what we call soccer, they call football?

736
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:57,220
Because they're a bunch of maniacs for unpassionate people.

737
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,940
And I don't use the word maniac in a negative way.

738
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:08,300
I mean, they're passionate, and so often, we as God's people, we lack passion.

739
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:14,020
Paul stands and says, I'm not mad, I'm not crazy, but I'm speaking forth the words of

740
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,500
truth and soberness.

741
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,740
For the king knoweth, in verse 26, of these things, before whom also I speak freely, for

742
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,820
I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done

743
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,540
in a corner.

744
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,500
Saying Agrippa, believest thou the prophets, I think he was passionate in his question

745
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
to Agrippa.

746
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,180
I know that thou believest.

747
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,620
And Agrippa responds and says, almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

748
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:47,380
And Paul says, I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day were

749
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:54,620
both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.

750
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,100
Paul's passionate.

751
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,820
We must serve the Lord humbly, we must serve the Lord compassionately, we must serve the

752
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Lord passionately.

753
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,060
Finally, number four this morning, we must serve the Lord faithfully.

754
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,220
We must serve the Lord faithfully.

755
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,779
Notice back in Acts chapter 20, the Bible says in verse number 20 that he went, notice

756
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:17,220
it says, and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you

757
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,060
notice and have taught you publicly and from house to house.

758
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,940
He was faithful to preach in the square, but also to go and meet people where they

759
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
are.

760
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,180
And he proclaimed, he served, he taught publicly and house to house.

761
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,660
Notice in verse 26, and really, I believe this morning, we don't have time to get into

762
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,020
all of it, but I believe that in verse number 26 that Paul is making a direct, I mean, straight

763
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:48,100
line back to Ezekiel's book when God says that he sent Ezekiel to be a watchman.

764
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,639
And that if you warn the people and they don't respond, then you're free.

765
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,540
You're not guilty of their blood, but if you fail to warn them, then their blood is on

766
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
your hands.

767
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,459
We don't have time to develop all of that, but Ezekiel 3 and 33, you find that God makes

768
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:04,139
that declaration.

769
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:07,500
Paul would have known the Old Testament extremely well.

770
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,020
And so in verse number 26, he says, wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure

771
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
from the blood of all men.

772
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,979
That is a powerful statement under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

773
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:22,900
That's just not me or you saying, listen, I will be honest, I am not free from the blood

774
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,800
of all men.

775
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,779
There are more times in my life that I like to admit that I have failed to share the gospel

776
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,020
with someone.

777
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,460
More times than I like to admit.

778
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,020
You missed the opportunity.

779
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,300
Not sensitive to the Holy Spirit of God.

780
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,500
More times than I like to admit.

781
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,339
But Paul, he was faithful.

782
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,660
That's what the Bible says in verse number 31, therefore watch and remember that by the

783
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:54,779
space of three years, he says this, for three years, I ceased not to warn everyone night

784
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,900
and day with tears.

785
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,820
You want to talk about someone that was exhausted physically?

786
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,979
I think Paul could say, that's me.

787
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:10,380
Many of us, we don't really know what it means to be tired.

788
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,320
You say, pastor, I beg to differ.

789
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,080
But understand, he said, I ceased not for three years.

790
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,040
And this isn't the only three years of his ministry, by the way.

791
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,400
This is what he's speaking to about the ministry there in Ephesus, in Asia, as he says Asia

792
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,119
Minor, as he says to these church leaders from Ephesus that gathered together, and he

793
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,400
says for those three years, I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

794
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,940
God's called us to be faithful.

795
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,380
He said in verse 24, none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto

796
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,260
myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received

797
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,500
of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

798
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,220
And then he's able to say, I have finished.

799
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,540
He was faithful.

800
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,100
He was faithful unto the end.

801
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,180
He was faithful.

802
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,900
The Bible tells us, moreover, it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful.

803
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:12,619
There's a lot of things that a lot of us can't do but all of us can be faithful.

804
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:15,699
Not all of us can play the piano.

805
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:17,140
Not all of us can preach.

806
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,940
Not all of us can disciple.

807
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,500
Not all of us can, you just start filling in the blank.

808
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Not all of us can sing.

809
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,679
Not all of us can lead music.

810
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,820
Not all of us can work in the nursery.

811
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:33,580
Come on, not all of us, you just keep doing the blank, but all of us can be faithful.

812
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,420
We can be faithful, be faithful.

813
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I'm thankful that our God is faithful.

814
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:46,299
We're a faithful God, but he's called us to be faithful and we're to serve God faithfully.

815
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:48,339
I think about Noah.

816
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:53,860
I was praying here this morning and just praying over the message and God brought to my Noah.

817
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,619
He was faithful to do a work, but he was faithful to preach.

818
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:00,660
He was a preacher of righteousness, the Bible tells us, and he was faithful.

819
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,540
And I tell you this morning that your faithfulness and my faithfulness should not be dependent

820
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,339
on results.

821
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,339
Why do I say that?

822
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:16,220
Remember last week, for the audience of one, for the audience of one, I'm faithful because

823
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,980
I'm serving Christ.

824
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,019
I'm serving the Lord.

825
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,019
There are no results.

826
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,339
You think about some of the great missionaries that we look to today, Adam Jetson, Hudson

827
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:29,360
Taylor, others, that they went to these places and they had no converts.

828
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,760
They had no people that were flocking to Christ to hear their message.

829
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,200
Some of them went years without a convert, but they were faithful.

830
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Why?

831
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,200
For the audience of one.

832
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,480
I remember reading of William Carey, the Bible says, or the Bible, the book that I was reading

833
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,559
on William Carey mentioned that for a number of years he had no converts, but he was faithful.

834
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:57,119
I mean, dealt with opposition after opposition, difficulty after difficulty, but some years

835
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,080
after his life there were over 100,000 believers in that place where he was called to minister

836
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,519
that all of them could singularly trace their spiritual heritage back to that one man.

837
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,360
It's amazing.

838
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,200
He was faithful.

839
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,000
He was faithful.

840
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,959
Look at Hebrews 13 in closing this morning.

841
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:23,459
Hebrews 13 in closing, listen, God's called each of us to serve the Lord.

842
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,880
He's called each of us to serve Christ.

843
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,559
What a privilege.

844
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,200
What a privilege to serve the Lord.

845
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,200
In whatever capacity it is, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

846
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,720
However He's equipped you, however He's called you, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

847
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:48,640
One day we're going to give an account for what we did with how He's equipped us.

848
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,959
The Bible tells us in Hebrews 13, verse 20 and 21, I want you to see these verses as

849
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,320
we close.

850
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,040
The Bible says, now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,

851
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,360
that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant.

852
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,920
Notice where it says, make you perfect in every what?

853
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,320
Good work.

854
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
To do His what?

855
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,519
To do His will.

856
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:16,440
Working in you, aren't you thankful He's working in us?

857
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,440
That which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and

858
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,080
ever, amen.

859
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:33,080
For the audience of one, last week's message, this week's message, so run that ye may obtain.

860
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,440
As we evaluate our service to God, listen, we serve a great God.

861
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,040
All year we've been talking about how great He is.

862
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,279
And He's great, but He's worthy of our service.

863
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:48,200
He's worthy of our work, our good work.

864
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,959
And He's equipped us, He's enabled us.

865
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:54,880
This morning we see in the life of Paul and how often we can say, man, look at, look at

866
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,440
the Apostle Paul, look at how, what he did for the Lord, look at how God used him.

867
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, it's because he was surrendered, because he was set focused on pleasing the Lord.

868
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,320
And how did, how did Paul serve and how should we serve?

869
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,119
Well, he served the Lord humbly.

870
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:14,799
It is absolutely essential that we serve the Lord with humility.

871
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:17,040
He served the Lord compassionately.

872
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,040
People knew that he cared, he loved them, they were dear unto him.

873
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,720
He served the Lord passionately.

874
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,160
He was proclaiming the words of life and he served the Lord faithfully.

875
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,960
Until his very last moment, he said, the time of my departure is at hand, but I have fought

876
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,640
a good fight.

877
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,119
If God has you here, He has a purpose for you.

878
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,559
And we're to do good works, we're to not again to be saved or to stay saved, but because

879
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,239
we are saved, we get to serve Him.

880
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,239
Let's pray.

881
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,239
Father, we love you.

882
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:52,159
Thank you for the privilege of knowing you.

883
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,679
If there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today they'd be saved.

884
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:05,000
Lord, I pray for each child of God that we would evaluate, examine our service to thee.

885
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,760
Lord, that you'd help us to serve you humbly, compassionately, passionately, and faithfully.

886
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:21,159
Lord, help us to do all that we do for the audience of one to please you, Lord, singularly.

887
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,720
But understanding that our service to thee will have an impact on many.

888
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,159
Help us, Lord, to serve you as we ought.

889
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,919
I pray that you'd move and work in our midst as only you can, that decisions would be made

890
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,840
that would please thee and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.

891
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,239
Would you stand?
