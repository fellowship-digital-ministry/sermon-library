WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.059
pairing, and I certainly appreciate all of the hard work,

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.659
and appreciate Ron and Mady doing the decorations.

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.239
They were here late last night finishing up,

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.880
and always appreciate them doing the decorations

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.479
here in the church, and certainly thankful,

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.640
as I mentioned, Brother Ron is traveling,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.840
and he's heading down to Georgia.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.840
Take your Bibles.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.239
I know I have Acts chapter 20,

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.000
but I want you to start in the book

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.440
of 1 Corinthians chapter number nine.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.200
We're gonna look at a few passages of scripture

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.360
before we find our way to Acts chapter number 20

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.920
this morning, and so eventually we'll get there.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.240
Last week, we had the opportunity,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.200
as we gathered together, to be challenged

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
to evaluate our service to the Lord,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.939
and we considered this thought last week.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.880
For the audience of one, we must remember

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.119
that our service is indeed for the audience of one.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:49.919
It's for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.180
and that at the same time, we understand

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.959
that it will have an impact on many,

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:56.919
and I begin to think about that truth,

00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.680
and as we examined that portion of scripture last week,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.319
and really understanding that God has called us

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.480
to be his servants, and what a great privilege it is

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.519
to serve the Lord, that we singularly are seeking

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.160
to serve Christ for the audience of one,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.760
but there are many that will be impacted by our service.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.199
There are people that are watching us,

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:22.559
people that are observing us, people that will be influenced

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.559
and impacted by our service, may I say it this way,

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.800
or lack thereof, amen, and people are watching,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.199
and people are certainly seeing the example

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:35.680
that we are setting, and our service is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.360
for the audience of one, it's for the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.680
seeking to please him alone, but many will be impacted.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.519
I believe that as you study the New Testament,

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.720
you would agree with me that the Lord used

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.160
the apostle Paul in a variety of ways.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
In fact, as you read through the New Testament,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.120
you'll find that God chose to record many details

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.000
about the life of Paul.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.879
We had the privilege of reading through the book of Acts,

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.000
we'll be in Acts chapter number 20 here shortly.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.519
We had the opportunity to read in the book of Acts

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:07.120
various aspects of the missionary journeys

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.880
that God allowed for the apostle Paul to go on.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.039
We find that as we read the New Testament books

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.039
that God would use several of them,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.399
the human penman, he would use Paul to pen those books,

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.500
and through those books, we have the opportunity

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940
to not only learn about the ministry of the apostle Paul

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.220
and how he was ministering to others and encouraging them,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.820
but also we have the opportunity to evaluate

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.059
his own service to the Lord.

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.940
And we find that as we study the New Testament,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.139
and again, as we have the opportunity to study

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.759
the life of the apostle Paul in the New Testament,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.979
I believe this morning, truly, the apostle Paul

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.960
served for the audience of one.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.580
He served the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.259
He was not interested in pleasing certain groups of people,

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.259
as he would go from place to place and minister.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.860
He was serving the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.940
for the audience of one.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.779
I believe truly this morning

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.779
that the apostle Paul had the desire,

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.940
in fact, we'll see it in Acts chapter number 20,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.520
that he would finish his race, his course with joy,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.779
that he would hear, well done thou good and faithful servant

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.139
and that he would finish what God had called him to do.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.139
I believe that he had that aspect or that perspective

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.660
for the audience of one,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.460
but it's obviously clear, abundantly clear,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.139
as you read through the New Testament,

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.740
that his service not only was pleasing to God,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.139
but it has impacted generations of believers.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.979
Not only those in the first century that knew

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.460
and Paul ministered to them personally,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.259
but for centuries now, we've had the complete canon

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.460
of the New Testament, of God's word,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.860
and we have the New Testament, and as we study,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.899
as we dig into the New Testament, still to this very day,

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.460
the life and service of the apostle Paul

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.539
is impacting scores of believers,

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.600
and for that, we ought to be thankful.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.820
You think about your life,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.259
and obviously, as God gives us life,

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.500
it's just but for a moment.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.580
James says it this way, what is your life?

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.940
It appears for a little time and then vanisheth away,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.800
and we understand that to be true.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.380
We understand the brevity of life,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.539
and as we begin to think about the brevity of life

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.440
and thinking about how God would use us in our lifetime

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040
to serve him and to impact individuals,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.519
but then to consider that God will allow our lives

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.079
after we leave this earth

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:30.279
to continue to impact generations.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.320
That's amazing, and that's certainly something

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.040
that God can do in and through each of our lives.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.559
As we look at a few of these passages

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.600
starting in 1 Corinthians 9,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.519
I believe in these few passages that we're gonna read

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.540
as we lay the groundwork for getting

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.660
to Acts chapter number 20,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.940
that really in these portions of scripture

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.739
starting in 1 Corinthians 9,

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:54.459
God provides us with a record

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:57.700
of really Paul's approach to serving the Lord.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.540
What was it that shaped the ministry of the apostle Paul?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.100
What was it that gave him the framework,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.880
the philosophy of ministry, if you will?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.100
Why is it that we speak of and look at the New Testament

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.339
and see the service of Paul

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:17.100
and say this is commendable and noteworthy

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.779
and exemplary, his service to God?

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.260
Well, I believe that God gives us some insight

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.920
as we'll see in a few of these passages.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.059
Notice in 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 23,

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.140
the Bible says this,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.380
Paul is speaking to these believers in Corinth,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.779
and he says, and this I do for the gospel's sake.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.459
If you were to look back into the chapter,

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.140
you find verse number 16

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.619
about the responsibility of preaching the gospel

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:40.660
and that God had called him to this,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.059
and he says, this I do for the gospel's sake,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.100
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.820
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.940
but one receiveth the prize.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.980
He says this, so run that ye may obtain.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.140
That phrase is the phrase that I've used

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.700
for our title of our message this morning,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.040
so run that ye may obtain.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.140
He says in verse 25,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.220
and every man that striveth for the mastery

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.839
is temperate in all things.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.059
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:14.299
but notice we, an incorruptible.

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:17.380
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly,

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.859
so fight I not as one that beateth the air,

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:22.380
but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.059
lest that by any means, when I have preached to others,

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.619
I myself should be a castaway.

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.100
That idea is really to be useless or of no value,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.220
and Paul is saying, I do this for the gospel's sake,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.140
thinking about the audience of one,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.959
but also that I might be partaker thereof with you,

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.279
the impact that it would have on many.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.000
And he says, this I do, this is my approach,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.519
this is how I'm serving the Lord, why?

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:49.600
Because I'm running that I might obtain.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.079
So run that ye may obtain.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.799
He tells that to the believers at Corinth,

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:54.839
but Paul himself, I believe,

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.640
is seeking to serve the Lord in that manner.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.260
A familiar verse of scripture to us is Galatians 2,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.420
if you turn over to that portion of scripture

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.959
in Galatians chapter number two,

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:09.959
and we find that Paul gives this great climatic statement,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.920
if you will, with regard to his view of his own self

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.640
and his ministry to the Lord

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880
and understanding his place of service.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.640
He says in Galatians 2 in verse number 20,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.959
I am crucified with Christ.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.200
Nevertheless, I live.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.959
Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.839
and the life which I now live in the flesh,

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.279
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:37.160
and gave himself for me.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.720
The Apostle Paul was living the crucified life

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.600
as we've often referred to it as,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.760
and we find that he was all in,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.920
he was surrendered to the Lord,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.359
and we begin to think about his surrender

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:53.399
and his service to Christ and how he understood.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:56.320
And again, as we begin to look at these few passages

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.420
to develop and understand the framework,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.079
the approach that the Apostle Paul

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.920
to have in his service to the Lord,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.239
it will help us as we too serve the Lord.

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:08.079
The book of Philippians,

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:10.760
just a few pages over in your Bible,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.200
Philippians chapter number three.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.260
In Philippians chapter number three,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.480
we really could read verses four through 14,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.239
but for sake of time, I want you to jot that passage down

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.040
so that you could read the entirety of it.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.619
For sake of time, I'm gonna pick it up

00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:27.279
in verse number 11 down through verse number 14.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:28.679
But again, notice the approach

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:30.559
that Paul has in serving the Lord.

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:32.960
He says this in verse number 11 of Philippians three,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.960
if by any means I might attain

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.119
unto the resurrection of the dead,

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:40.880
not as though I had already attained,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.679
either were already perfect.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.520
In other words, I have not arrived,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.239
neither have you, neither have I.

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.799
He says, but I follow after,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.200
if that I may apprehend that

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.239
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

00:08:56.239 --> 00:09:00.080
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.599
but this one thing I do,

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:03.640
forgetting those things which are behind

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.520
and reaching forth unto those things which are before.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.599
I press, do you see the imagery that God gives us

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:13.400
as Paul is sharing his approach to ministry?

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.679
I press toward the mark

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:20.200
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.340
He's not being, if it's convenient, if it's comfortable.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.000
No, he says, I'm pressing toward the mark,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.840
so run that you may obtain.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.880
He shares that in First Corinthians nine.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.840
He says here in Philippians three

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.000
that he is seeking and following after the Lord.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.640
He wants to apprehend that

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.880
for which he was apprehended of Christ.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.599
He wants to press toward the mark

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:45.479
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:48.039
One day, each of us will stand,

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.400
if you're saved this morning,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.359
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:52.559
as your personal Savior,

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.119
you will stand at the judgment seat of Christ.

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:58.359
And I'm looking forward to the opportunity,

00:09:58.359 --> 00:10:00.000
Lord willing to hear, well done,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.960
good and faithful servant, and to receive crowns of service.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.039
Remember, it's God who has enabled us,

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.140
who has equipped us, who has called us,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.340
but then he rewards us for serving him.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.680
It's an amazing truth of God's word.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.680
And I hope this morning that each of us

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.319
would have that understanding

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:17.819
that when I stand before the Lord,

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:20.920
that I would not have that wood, hay, and stubble

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.120
that will be burned up,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.459
but that we'd have that silver, gold, and precious stone

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:28.260
that we would serve the Lord acceptably,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360
that we would serve him faithfully.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.799
And we find here that the Apostle Paul,

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.919
this is what he's doing.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:36.099
He's pressing toward the mark.

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:37.939
Again, if you would think about the imagery,

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:41.259
you see someone who is constant and consistent.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:44.540
Notice one final passage, 2 Timothy chapter four,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.599
before we get to the book of Acts.

00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:47.979
In 2 Timothy chapter number four,

00:10:47.979 --> 00:10:50.720
it's a familiar portion of scripture.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.279
Paul, this is the last letter

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.880
that God would use the Apostle Paul to pen

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.840
before he would be martyred for the faith.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.639
And he's writing it to his son in the faith.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.680
He's writing it to Timothy.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.559
He's seeking to influence and instruct

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.599
and to encourage Timothy to continue to serve the Lord

00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:10.639
and to finish his course, to finish his race.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:14.519
But Paul says in 2 Timothy four and verse number six,

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.819
for I am now ready to be offered.

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:20.160
So Paul's ministry has come to an end.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.879
It's come to a conclusion.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:25.440
He understands that the time of his departure is at hand.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.720
It was not just that he was going to depart

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.919
from a particular location in that his ministry

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:33.160
in that locale was completed.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.879
No, it was that he was going to go home.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.199
Remember, he said in 2 Corinthians,

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:40.519
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:42.639
Paul understood that this was the end

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:45.440
of his earthly ministry, the end of his earthly life.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.839
He would soon face a martyr's death.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.000
He says, the time of my departure is at hand.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.459
But notice he says, I have fought a good fight.

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:53.940
I have finished my course.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.080
I have kept the faith.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.919
Oh, that God wouldn't allow each of us

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.500
at the end of our lives to be able to say

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.959
what Paul says in verse number seven,

00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:04.419
that it would not be, I wish I would have.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:07.120
If only I would have, if I could change this.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.259
No, I don't want to have those types of regrets.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:11.460
And we see that Paul, he was not perfect,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.820
but he was a man who was surrendered to the Lord.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.660
He was a man who was committed to serving Christ.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.259
And he says, I have fought a good fight.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:20.720
I have finished my course.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.660
I have kept the faith.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.020
Notice verse number eight, henceforth,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.820
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.740
Remember, we said in First Corinthians nine,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.440
he says, they run to obtain a corruptible,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.740
but we an incorruptible.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.580
He says, so run that ye may obtain.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.220
And Paul had this, this isn't pride,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.479
but he has this confidence that there is laid up for him,

00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:47.380
for me, a crown of righteousness.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.779
There are five crowns that are mentioned

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:49.619
in the New Testament.

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:51.300
We won't take time to deal with that this morning,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.539
but this is one of the five.

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:53.839
He says, a crown of righteousness,

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.860
notice, which the Lord, the righteous judge,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.740
by the way, he is a righteous judge,

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.059
shall give me at that day.

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:04.139
But notice the end of the verse.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.979
And not to me only, but unto all them also

00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:10.539
that love his appearing.

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:12.320
So this morning, just as the apostle Paul

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.759
could have confidence of receiving this crown,

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.139
as he said that he was pressing toward that mark,

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:20.100
he wanted to receive that well done.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.179
And we find that he says,

00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:23.860
there is a crown of righteousness that the Lord,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.220
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.539
So this morning, as we begin to think about our service

00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:32.160
to the Lord, as we consider last week's message

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.539
for the audience of one,

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:35.800
we understand that God has called us

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.979
and God has equipped us and we're serving the Lord,

00:13:38.979 --> 00:13:41.619
but it will have an impact on many.

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:43.899
I look to Acts chapter number 20.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.419
And in Acts chapter number 20,

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.220
we have the opportunity to see and to read

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.419
of an interaction between the apostle Paul

00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:54.339
and the church leaders of the church at Ephesus.

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.419
The apostle Paul, historically,

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.139
at this particular time in his life,

00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:01.380
in Acts chapter number 20, he's on his way to Jerusalem.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.500
And as he's heading towards Jerusalem,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.940
he's really going and traveling with haste

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.660
because he's desiring to be there at the day of Pentecost.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.820
And because of that, he would not have opportunity

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.299
within his schedule to stop in at Ephesus

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:18.920
and have any interaction with those church leaders.

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:20.459
So what does he do?

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.880
He calls for those church leaders to meet him.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.480
And here is the conversation that God records for us

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.440
between the apostle Paul and the church leaders at Ephesus.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.880
And in this particular portion of scripture,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.320
this few verses we're gonna look at this morning,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.320
I believe that God gives us four aspects of Paul's service

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.959
that would be helpful for each of us today

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.480
to be able to apply in our own lives.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.519
Notice the Bible says, beginning in Acts chapter number 20

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.000
and verse number 17, and from Miletus,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.799
he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:59.119
And when they were come to him, he said unto them,

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:01.720
and so Paul was addressing these church leaders.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.200
He's going to share personal testimony of his own ministry,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.839
but then he's gonna encourage them

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.119
with regard to their service to Christ

00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:12.200
and their time that they have to minister.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.359
And he says this in verse number 18,

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:17.559
ye know from the first day that I came into Asia

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:21.760
after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.679
serving the Lord with all humility of mind

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:27.119
and with many tears and temptations,

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:29.920
which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.839
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:36.239
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.519
and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:42.239
and also to the Greeks repentance toward God

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:45.040
and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.640
And now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.880
not knowing the things that shall befall me there,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.320
save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.320
saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.079
Verse 24, but none of these things move me,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:04.359
neither count I my life dear unto myself,

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:06.959
so that I might finish my course with joy

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:09.399
in the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:12.679
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:15.160
And now behold, I know that ye all among whom

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.920
I have gone preaching the kingdom of God

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.679
shall see my face no more.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.079
Wherefore, I take you to record this day

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:23.559
that I am pure from the blood of all men,

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:25.279
for I have not shunned to declare unto you

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:27.239
all the counsel of God.

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:31.239
So verse 27 concludes Paul sharing at that point

00:16:31.239 --> 00:16:34.399
his testimony of his service and rehearsing to them.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.820
He's going to continue making some references,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.019
but now he's addressing them,

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:40.640
these leaders of the church at Ephesus

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.000
with regard to their service.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.220
Verse 28, take heed therefore unto yourselves

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.600
and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.079
hath made you overseers to feed the church of God

00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:53.640
which he hath purchased with his own blood.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.920
For I know this, that after my departing

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.119
shall grievous wolves enter in among you,

00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:00.399
not sparing the flock, also of your own selves

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:02.559
shall men arise speaking perverse things

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:05.299
to draw away disciples after them.

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:08.720
Therefore, watch and remember that by the space

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.519
of three years, I, again he's speaking

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:13.179
about his own ministry, cease not to warn everyone

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:15.760
night and day with tears, and now brethren,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.399
I commend you to God and to the word of his grace

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:22.720
which is able to build you up and to give you

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.480
an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.980
I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.239
yea, ye yourselves know that these hands

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:32.440
have ministered unto my necessities

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.079
and to them that were with me.

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:37.880
I have showed you all things, so laboring

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.519
you ought to support the weak and to remember

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:42.279
the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:44.880
it is more blessed to give than to receive.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.320
Notice verse 36, and when he had thus spoken,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.239
he kneeled down and prayed with them all.

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:53.279
So Paul addresses these believers,

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:55.000
these church leaders from Ephesus,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.760
he calls them and they meet together,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.859
and within this passage of scripture,

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:01.640
there's great truth that is revealed to us,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.559
but I find four specific aspects of Paul's ministry

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:09.160
and how it is that in verse 24 he could say

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.920
that I might finish my course with joy,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.640
and the ministry, notice, that I have received

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.440
of the Lord Jesus, he's given each of us a ministry.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.760
Your ministry differs than Paul's ministry

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.200
and your ministry probably differs

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.079
than the person sitting around you,

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:26.640
but God has equipped us and he's called us

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.339
to serve him and Paul says I desire to finish

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:33.359
my course with joy, understanding that this ministry

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.880
has been given to me and trusted to me

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.000
by the Lord Jesus, and we find that he's able

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.760
to say at the end of his life, I have finished,

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.099
I've kept the faith, I've finished my course,

00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:48.000
and he knew that there was a crown of righteousness,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.099
so he says, and I believe that he believed this

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.880
for himself in First Corinthians nine,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.679
so run that ye may obtain, he's saying that

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:58.400
to the believers in Corinth, he says it to himself,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.099
probably to others as well, and understanding

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.859
this morning that Paul served the Lord,

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:05.299
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:09.900
he served the Lord humbly, humbly, he was a humble man.

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:14.020
Humility is necessary in our service to Christ.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.880
It's absolutely essential.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.619
Notice the Bible says in verse number 19,

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:23.619
serving the Lord with all humility of mind

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.340
and with many tears and temptations,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.900
which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.900
Humility in service to the king is absolutely essential.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.219
It's absolutely essential.

00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:36.059
Why do we say that?

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:37.419
Well, because the Bible tells us

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:40.099
that God resisteth the proud,

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.580
but giveth grace unto the humble.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.359
As we serve the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:46.780
we understand that it is he that has called us,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.619
it is he that has equipped us, he has enabled us.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:53.059
Paul said that he was thankful that God enabled him

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:54.700
and that he put him into the ministry,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.859
and we find this morning that as Paul

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:59.340
is serving the Lord as we get some insight here

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.179
in Acts chapter.

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:06.099
20 with regard to his manner of service, we find that he served the Lord humbly.

00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:10.779
Listen, this morning, it's essential. Notice in Philippians chapter number 2,

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:15.539
notice what Paul says as he's speaking to these believers in Philippi. Of course,

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:19.619
he's addressing there in Acts chapter number 20 the church leaders of Ephesus,

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:23.699
but I want you to see what Paul says about humility. As we look here in

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:28.259
Philippians chapter number 2, he says this in verse number 3 of Philippians 2,

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:33.339
let nothing be done. Now, if he says let nothing be done, that's pretty

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:37.619
all-inclusive, is it not? And so that certainly would include our service to

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:43.419
Christ. He says let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:48.659
lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look, not every

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:52.539
man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. But then we find

00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:56.019
in verse number 5, there's this great truth that Paul gives to these believers

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:59.939
at Philippi and to us by way of preservation. The Bible says let this

00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:06.419
mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. You know, he is, the Lord Jesus

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:12.979
Christ is God. He's God. God in flesh. The beginning was the Word, and the Word was

00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:17.819
with God, and the Word was God. Amen? And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:22.859
tabernacled among us, John chapter number 1. And you see, and obviously there's a

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:27.899
variety of passages of Scripture that prove the deity of Christ. We celebrate

00:21:27.899 --> 00:21:34.299
this time of year on our calendars, the Incarnation, the fact that God came to

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:38.739
this earth, and we find the deity of Christ, that He is God. Where is He that

00:21:38.739 --> 00:21:45.179
is born? King of the Jews. They bowed down and worshipped Him, is what the Bible

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:54.939
tells us. Why? Because He's God. But He was humble. He humbled Himself. Now think

00:21:54.939 --> 00:22:00.219
about that just for a moment. We're to serve the Lord humbly as Paul did, but we

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:04.819
find that Paul makes this approach an appeal to the church at Philippi. He says

00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:08.500
let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. In verse number 8, he

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.019
says, being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto

00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:18.259
death, even the death of the cross. Why? So that he could pay for your sins and

00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:26.059
mine. And he humbled himself. He's the Creator God. You read John 17, and you

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:30.219
read about the glory that He had with the Father, and eternity passed, and yet

00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:34.419
He left the glories of heaven, the splendor of heaven, to come to this

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:41.379
sin-cursed world so they could die for us. As we serve the Lord, we must also

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:46.739
serve Him humbly. We must understand this morning that it is easy for us to become

00:22:46.739 --> 00:22:50.299
prideful. It is easy for us to become full of ourselves and to think that we're

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:54.539
something, but reality is that we're just sinners saved by grace. I'm thankful to be

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:58.299
a saint. I'm thankful that Christ is in me, and I'm in Him, and I'm thankful that

00:22:58.299 --> 00:23:03.419
I'm heaven-bound, but we must serve the Lord with humility. First Peter says it

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:08.419
this way, that we're to be clothed with humility, and then a reference

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:13.219
that we see not only in First Peter 5, but also James 4, for God resisted the

00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:18.259
proud and giveth grace to the humble. This morning as we serve the Lord, we

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:24.219
must serve Him humbly. Let me say this morning that Paul was a servant. He says

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:28.500
that I was serving the Lord with all humility of mind. We must not only serve

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.739
the Lord humbly as Paul did, but number two, we must serve the Lord

00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:37.619
compassionately. Compassionately. Someone said, I'm not sure who it is, we've used

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:41.459
this phrase before, but often you'll find in life that people don't really

00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:45.500
care how much you know until they know how much you care. No doubt you've heard

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.819
that at some point in your life, and we find that the Apostle Paul was a man who

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:54.179
served the Lord with compassion. He served the Lord compassionately. I would

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:58.139
understand this morning that even as our Lord was humble, our Lord too was

00:23:58.139 --> 00:24:03.979
compassionate. Matthew 9 and verse 36 tells us that the Lord, He saw the

00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:08.979
multitudes and He was moved with compassion. Why do we say that the

00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:12.459
Apostle Paul served with compassion? Why did he serve the Lord compassionately?

00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:16.179
Well, notice in verse 19 it says, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, but

00:24:16.179 --> 00:24:21.380
notice, and with many tears. Skip down and look at verse 31. It says, therefore

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.660
watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.619
night and day with what? With tears. Why Paul? Why do you have tears, Paul? Well,

00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:35.660
because Paul understood the fact that every person that he came into contact

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.859
with was going to spend eternity in the lake of fire if they did not trust the

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:44.539
Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, and he was compassionate. He

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:48.660
cared about people. I mean this statement as we studied on Wednesday nights going

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.139
through the book of Ruth, how that we learned from Boaz that he was a man who

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:56.059
took interest in individuals. He was a man who stopped even in the busyness of

00:24:56.059 --> 00:25:00.139
his life and all the responsibilities that he had to be able to care

00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:05.739
about people. And this morning we see that Paul was a man that served the Lord

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:13.299
compassionately, compassionately. You know, sometimes we get branded as not being

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:21.220
compassionate, not really caring, but the reality is that we should be the ones

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:27.459
that care the most because we know the truth. As I begin to think about the

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:31.779
truth of compassion and the importance for you and for me this morning to be

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:36.539
compassionate in our service to Christ, we're mindful of the fact that we are

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:42.259
seeking to reach individuals that have been influenced. Listen, they're lost. The

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:45.380
God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not. When we think

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.019
about sharing the gospel with people, we understand that we at times we're called

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:52.779
to minister to people that oppose themselves. Paul speaks of that in 1st

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.979
Timothy and that we're to do it with meekness, the Bible says. And here we find

00:25:57.979 --> 00:26:03.459
that Paul, he's serving the Lord compassionately. We begin to think about

00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:09.179
the ministry of the Apostle Paul. We begin to look at the impact that Paul

00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:14.779
had and how God used the Apostle Paul to not only bring honor and glory to Christ

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:19.259
and he's serving the Lord Christ as a singular focus for the audience of one,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.299
but generations of believers have been influenced and impacted by the ministry

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:29.299
of the Apostle Paul. So what is it about his approach to ministry that is

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:34.539
exemplary for us that we could say that too is the manner by which we should

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:39.380
serve the Lord? Because if he served the Lord and he pleased God, and if he served

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.660
the Lord and he made an impact, then I can learn from his approach to service and I

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.899
can adopt in my own life how I too can serve Christ so that I can be pleasing

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:54.259
to the Lord and so that I can impact. Does that make sense? And so we find that

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:57.820
he served the Lord humbly, he served the Lord compassionately. Look if you will

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:03.699
in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 2. Often we've said as we've studied through

00:27:03.699 --> 00:27:08.459
the New Testament that there's no perfect church. By the way, this church is not a

00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:13.500
perfect church. There are no perfect churches, but we serve a perfect God.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.899
We have a perfect book. Amen? We're imperfect people, but we have a perfect

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:25.419
God and a perfect book and we seek to do all things in honor and glory to our God.

00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:29.579
There's no perfect church. The church in Thessalonica is a model church,

00:27:29.579 --> 00:27:33.380
no doubt. As you look throughout the New Testament, you have the opportunity to see

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.619
a number of different churches. You'll find that some churches are not model

00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:40.699
churches. The church at Corinth is probably the top of that list of this is

00:27:40.699 --> 00:27:44.979
not a model church. There's some things you can learn about their behavior and

00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:50.100
their actions of not to do, not to incorporate in your ministry. But when we

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.579
think about the church at Thessalonica, we find that they're a model church and

00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:56.940
there's much about this church that we can have the opportunity to say there's

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.459
some things that we can learn and apply from our lives. But as we think about the

00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:04.419
church in Thessalonica and we think about their influence in the place that

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:08.660
they have of being a model church, we find that within the content of this

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.820
first letter that Paul reveals to us his compassion, his compassionate

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.259
approach. When he comes to Thessalonica, just like as he had gone to other cities

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:22.579
during his ministries, during his missionary journeys, it was often met

00:28:22.579 --> 00:28:28.820
with some contention. It was often met with opposition. We find that such was

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.979
the case even in Thessalonica, but we find that the Bible tells us, notice in

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:35.140
1 Thessalonians 2, in verse number 5, the Bible says,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:29:00.339
Isn't that a great verse of Scripture?

00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:06.940
Paul, you were handling the Word of life, you were handling the Word of God, you were

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:13.940
handling eternal matters. Yes, but I was compassionate. I came in humbly. Notice

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.339
it says that we sought not glory in verse number 6, nor of men sought we glory,

00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:23.219
neither of you nor yet of others. And we find that he was humble, but he also says

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:28.739
that he came in and he was gentle among them. And then he uses this imagery that

00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:32.700
we find at the end of verse number 7 that's so impactful, where the Bible says,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:40.219
Even as a nurse cherisheth her children. And Paul says that was our approach to

00:29:40.219 --> 00:29:47.260
ministry. We're compassionate. Verse number 8, So being affectionately desirous

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:53.059
of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but

00:29:53.059 --> 00:30:00.580
also our own souls. Why? Because ye were dear unto us.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:06.260
I wonder this morning, as we evaluate our ministry and our service to God,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.500
I wonder, are we serving Christ humbly?

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.100
I wonder this morning, are we serving Christ compassionately?

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.220
Are there people in your life and in my life that know that we care about them?

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.980
That we're gentle, that they know that they're dear unto us?

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.380
Listen, I'm not suggesting that we change our message.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.740
I'm not suggesting that we compromise on what thus saith the Lord,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.620
because God's word is true, and we must stand on the precepts of God's word,

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.820
and I believe ultimately that being loving is speaking the truth.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.540
It is not very compassionate of me to see somebody that's opposing themselves,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.940
that's living in disobedience, that's following after whatever they're following after,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.460
and me to just put my arm around them and say,

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.100
love you man, everything's going to be okay.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.260
That's not really love, would you agree this morning?

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.940
But I can put my arm around them and say,

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.860
listen, can I share with you the truth of God's word?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.540
It's amazing when we begin to think about the power that God has given us in His word,

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.220
and the power of compassion.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.580
Listen, when people understand that you actually care about them, that you love them,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.420
that we can show the love of Christ.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.700
By the way, you can't do that in your own power, in your own flesh.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.420
You can only do that through the power and work of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.380
It's the only way to do it.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.980
And we love people, and we show that compassion.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.460
What a blessing to think about Paul's ministry and his service.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.180
We see in Acts 20 that he served the Lord humbly, he served the Lord compassionately.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:46.580
Let me say this, Paul served, number three, Paul served the Lord passionately, passionately.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.020
You know, I'm thankful for some passionate people.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.060
I remember one time somebody saying to me, this is probably 11 years ago,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.620
I've been here for almost 12 and a half years, probably 11 years ago.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.940
And it was a teenager, Luke is probably a little bit older than you.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.620
But I remember he just struggled coming to church, and I was trying to talk to him.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.500
And he said this, he said, well, the Bible's just boring.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.740
That's what he said to me.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.420
I said, well, let me ask you this.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.660
Do you think that I think the Bible's boring?

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.580
Oh, no, I don't think you think the Bible's boring.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.060
I mean, you're like passionate about this stuff.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.980
That was, I was glad to hear that.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.220
Why?

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.420
Because the Bible's not boring.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:32.340
And what that young man saw was somebody that actually believed what they were preaching.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.780
They're passionate about it.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.780
You've met people that are passionate.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.860
We joke sometimes with the Fesdections that everything that Zachary does, he does with

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.340
all of his being.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.940
Pierre, amen and amen, right?

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.700
I mean, he's all in.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.380
I got pictures of Zachary.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.620
When he's throwing water balloons at VBS this past year.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.980
And I mean, I don't know who took the picture, but I mean, it captured perfectly in one shot

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.540
all of the passion of Zachary.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.060
Listen, we ought to be passionate in our service for Christ.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.300
People ought to know that we truly believe the message that we're proclaiming and that

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.820
we're passionate about it.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.420
Notice in verse number 20 of Acts 20, the Bible says this.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.100
Why do I say that Paul was passionate?

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:24.980
Well, it says that in how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:30.180
Now, can I pause just for a moment and can I tell you this morning that we have been

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:36.740
called to deliver a message that is profitable to people that often do not know that the

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.860
message is profitable?

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.260
Do you understand what I just said?

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:50.500
God has called us to deliver a message that is profitable to people who often do not know

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.420
that that message is profitable.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.460
But still, we're called to proclaim the message.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:04.660
He says that he held back, I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:09.860
Notice as you look at verse 21, he says, testifying both of the Jews and also to the

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.100
Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.300
He's preaching this message of salvation, and he's preaching it, I believe, with passion.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.780
As you look at the Apostle Paul, as he travels from one town to the next town to the next

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:29.620
town, from one city to the next, he's facing opposition and he's facing persecution, and

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.220
yet he's going in and he's preaching, and I believe, with passion.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.180
We find that in verse 29 and 30, he gives us some insight as he's giving the instruction

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.660
to the church leaders of Ephesus with regard to their ministry and feeding the church of

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.220
God.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.580
He says this in verse 29 and 30, for I know this, that after my departing shall grievous

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.940
wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock, also of your own selves shall men arise

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.860
speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.340
Therefore, we should be passionate about our ministry.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:05.460
Listen, do you want, think about the imagery, as you understand the Bible gives us the imagery

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.660
that we're sheep, he's the shepherd, the pastor has been called as an under-shepherd,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.740
if we could use that terminology, and he says that there are going to be some grievous wolves

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.620
that are going to come in and they're not going to spare the flock.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.340
We've got to be passionate.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.660
Can I tell you this morning that the other side is passionate?

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.780
The other side is passionate?

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.780
They're passionate about what they believe.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:38.500
They're passionate, and sometimes we just sit on the sidelines and serve God with passion.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.660
Listen, compassionately, but with passion.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.380
I'm thankful that God's given us truth.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.660
I'm thankful that I know the truth and I can be passionate about it.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.220
Notice this interaction.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:58.180
If you turn to Acts 26, we're going to jump right in the middle of the context of the

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.900
passage of Scripture, but so that we can understand what's happening, Paul is giving a defense

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.340
here before Agrippa.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.180
He's given a defense before Festus already and Felix and what have you, and he's had

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.940
this opportunity, and he's standing before and giving testimony, and here in Acts 26,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.380
he's standing before Agrippa.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.100
And as he's standing before Agrippa, again, we won't take the time, we don't have the

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.140
time to go through all that Paul is speaking to him, but he's preaching, he's giving

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.900
the truth about his own testimony of salvation and conversion, and notice if we jump in at

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.580
verse number 24, and as he thus spake for himself, so Paul is preaching, I mean, I think

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:41.380
he's preaching with passion, he's sharing the truth with Agrippa, and others are there.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.620
The Bible says that Festus stands up with a loud voice.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.780
Notice it says, Paul, thou art beside thyself.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.740
Much learning doth make thee mad.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.300
Crazy.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.860
Festus is in opposition to what Paul is saying, but I think that as Paul was standing there

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.460
before Agrippa and that group of dignitaries that were gathered, that Paul was speaking

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.340
with passion.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.700
I believe that Festus was under conviction, no doubt Agrippa too will be under conviction

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.100
as we look here at this text of Scripture, but we find that Paul, he says in verse number

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.900
25 as he responds to Festus, he says, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.340
the words of truth and soberness.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.740
And we ought to be passionate about it.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:34.740
Listen, there are still people today, believe it or not, that are passionate about the football

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.700
team in Washington.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.020
I don't know how many years they've lost for.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.020
I don't know that they've ever had a winning record since I've lived here, all right?

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.020
I remember when I first moved here, and I'm not a huge sports fan.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:53.700
I liked sports a whole lot more years ago than I do now, but the reality is that when

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.740
I first moved here, there were people, okay, what team are you going to follow?

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.580
And we don't have a real big population of folks in our congregation that are really

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.820
avid sports fans, but there are people, I don't even know if Washington's playing at

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.540
home or away today, but there will be people at the game today that will color themselves

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.500
in paint that spent way too much money to go and buy a ticket.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.180
They're going to sit there, if it's local, they're going to sit here in nasty weather,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.860
and they're going to be passionately cheering for a losing team.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.020
Am I right?

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.620
Should we not be passionate for our cause?

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:39.619
Should we not have passion as we proclaim the message that Jesus is Lord?

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.700
I remember sitting in England, Liverpool, England.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.020
I love the Clemens, great friends, missionaries that we've supported for years.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.100
They've sat at our table, great friends.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.299
But I remember Joseph was there.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.299
He's the only one in the auditorium that was there with us.

00:38:57.299 --> 00:39:01.059
I remember serving and getting there for that Sunday at Breck Road Baptist Church,

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.140
and I remember going in there and we stood up to sing.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.980
Man, I was ready to sing like we sing here.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.179
And within the first two verses, I found...

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.580
Not two verses, two measures.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:15.140
I found out that no one was singing anywhere near as close to what my volume was.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.980
And I kind of had to tone it down and had to kind of...

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.220
And it's very formal.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.780
That's just their worship, very formal.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.500
And I remember talking to Brother Clemens.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:28.980
He said,

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.059
English people aren't very passionate.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.619
And I'm not criticizing Brother Clemens.

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:38.900
Don't misunderstand my point.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.580
And it's very, this is just how we worship.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.140
That's fine.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.540
But I said to Brother Clemens, I said, well, how do you describe when they're watching

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.500
what we call soccer, they call football?

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:57.220
Because they're a bunch of maniacs for unpassionate people.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.940
And I don't use the word maniac in a negative way.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:08.300
I mean, they're passionate, and so often, we as God's people, we lack passion.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:14.020
Paul stands and says, I'm not mad, I'm not crazy, but I'm speaking forth the words of

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.500
truth and soberness.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.740
For the king knoweth, in verse 26, of these things, before whom also I speak freely, for

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.820
I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.540
in a corner.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.500
Saying Agrippa, believest thou the prophets, I think he was passionate in his question

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.500
to Agrippa.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.180
I know that thou believest.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.620
And Agrippa responds and says, almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.380
And Paul says, I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day were

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:54.620
both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.100
Paul's passionate.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.820
We must serve the Lord humbly, we must serve the Lord compassionately, we must serve the

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.820
Lord passionately.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.060
Finally, number four this morning, we must serve the Lord faithfully.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.220
We must serve the Lord faithfully.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.779
Notice back in Acts chapter 20, the Bible says in verse number 20 that he went, notice

00:41:13.779 --> 00:41:17.220
it says, and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.060
notice and have taught you publicly and from house to house.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.940
He was faithful to preach in the square, but also to go and meet people where they

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.940
are.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.180
And he proclaimed, he served, he taught publicly and house to house.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.660
Notice in verse 26, and really, I believe this morning, we don't have time to get into

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.020
all of it, but I believe that in verse number 26 that Paul is making a direct, I mean, straight

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:48.100
line back to Ezekiel's book when God says that he sent Ezekiel to be a watchman.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.639
And that if you warn the people and they don't respond, then you're free.

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:57.540
You're not guilty of their blood, but if you fail to warn them, then their blood is on

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.540
your hands.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.459
We don't have time to develop all of that, but Ezekiel 3 and 33, you find that God makes

00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:04.139
that declaration.

00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:07.500
Paul would have known the Old Testament extremely well.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:12.020
And so in verse number 26, he says, wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.020
from the blood of all men.

00:42:14.339 --> 00:42:18.979
That is a powerful statement under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:42:18.979 --> 00:42:22.900
That's just not me or you saying, listen, I will be honest, I am not free from the blood

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.800
of all men.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.779
There are more times in my life that I like to admit that I have failed to share the gospel

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:31.020
with someone.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.460
More times than I like to admit.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.020
You missed the opportunity.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.300
Not sensitive to the Holy Spirit of God.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.500
More times than I like to admit.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.339
But Paul, he was faithful.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.660
That's what the Bible says in verse number 31, therefore watch and remember that by the

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:54.779
space of three years, he says this, for three years, I ceased not to warn everyone night

00:42:54.779 --> 00:42:56.900
and day with tears.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.820
You want to talk about someone that was exhausted physically?

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.979
I think Paul could say, that's me.

00:43:06.979 --> 00:43:10.380
Many of us, we don't really know what it means to be tired.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.320
You say, pastor, I beg to differ.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:19.080
But understand, he said, I ceased not for three years.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.040
And this isn't the only three years of his ministry, by the way.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:28.400
This is what he's speaking to about the ministry there in Ephesus, in Asia, as he says Asia

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.119
Minor, as he says to these church leaders from Ephesus that gathered together, and he

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:39.400
says for those three years, I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.940
God's called us to be faithful.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.380
He said in verse 24, none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.260
myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.500
of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.220
And then he's able to say, I have finished.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.540
He was faithful.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.100
He was faithful unto the end.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.180
He was faithful.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:05.900
The Bible tells us, moreover, it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:12.619
There's a lot of things that a lot of us can't do but all of us can be faithful.

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:15.699
Not all of us can play the piano.

00:44:15.699 --> 00:44:17.140
Not all of us can preach.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.940
Not all of us can disciple.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.500
Not all of us can, you just start filling in the blank.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.500
Not all of us can sing.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.679
Not all of us can lead music.

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:26.820
Not all of us can work in the nursery.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:33.580
Come on, not all of us, you just keep doing the blank, but all of us can be faithful.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.420
We can be faithful, be faithful.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.420
I'm thankful that our God is faithful.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:46.299
We're a faithful God, but he's called us to be faithful and we're to serve God faithfully.

00:44:46.299 --> 00:44:48.339
I think about Noah.

00:44:48.339 --> 00:44:53.860
I was praying here this morning and just praying over the message and God brought to my Noah.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.619
He was faithful to do a work, but he was faithful to preach.

00:44:56.619 --> 00:45:00.660
He was a preacher of righteousness, the Bible tells us, and he was faithful.

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:05.540
And I tell you this morning that your faithfulness and my faithfulness should not be dependent

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.339
on results.

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:10.339
Why do I say that?

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:16.220
Remember last week, for the audience of one, for the audience of one, I'm faithful because

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.980
I'm serving Christ.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.019
I'm serving the Lord.

00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:21.019
There are no results.

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:24.339
You think about some of the great missionaries that we look to today, Adam Jetson, Hudson

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:29.360
Taylor, others, that they went to these places and they had no converts.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.760
They had no people that were flocking to Christ to hear their message.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.200
Some of them went years without a convert, but they were faithful.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200
Why?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200
For the audience of one.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:46.480
I remember reading of William Carey, the Bible says, or the Bible, the book that I was reading

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.559
on William Carey mentioned that for a number of years he had no converts, but he was faithful.

00:45:51.559 --> 00:45:57.119
I mean, dealt with opposition after opposition, difficulty after difficulty, but some years

00:45:57.119 --> 00:46:02.080
after his life there were over 100,000 believers in that place where he was called to minister

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:08.519
that all of them could singularly trace their spiritual heritage back to that one man.

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:10.360
It's amazing.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.200
He was faithful.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.000
He was faithful.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.959
Look at Hebrews 13 in closing this morning.

00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:23.459
Hebrews 13 in closing, listen, God's called each of us to serve the Lord.

00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:25.880
He's called each of us to serve Christ.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.559
What a privilege.

00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:30.200
What a privilege to serve the Lord.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:35.200
In whatever capacity it is, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.720
However He's equipped you, however He's called you, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:48.640
One day we're going to give an account for what we did with how He's equipped us.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.959
The Bible tells us in Hebrews 13, verse 20 and 21, I want you to see these verses as

00:46:52.959 --> 00:46:54.320
we close.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.040
The Bible says, now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.360
that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.920
Notice where it says, make you perfect in every what?

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.320
Good work.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.440
To do His what?

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.519
To do His will.

00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:16.440
Working in you, aren't you thankful He's working in us?

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:23.440
That which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.080
ever, amen.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:33.080
For the audience of one, last week's message, this week's message, so run that ye may obtain.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.440
As we evaluate our service to God, listen, we serve a great God.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.040
All year we've been talking about how great He is.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.279
And He's great, but He's worthy of our service.

00:47:44.279 --> 00:47:48.200
He's worthy of our work, our good work.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.959
And He's equipped us, He's enabled us.

00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:54.880
This morning we see in the life of Paul and how often we can say, man, look at, look at

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.440
the Apostle Paul, look at how, what he did for the Lord, look at how God used him.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:05.000
Well, it's because he was surrendered, because he was set focused on pleasing the Lord.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.320
And how did, how did Paul serve and how should we serve?

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.119
Well, he served the Lord humbly.

00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:14.799
It is absolutely essential that we serve the Lord with humility.

00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:17.040
He served the Lord compassionately.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.040
People knew that he cared, he loved them, they were dear unto him.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.720
He served the Lord passionately.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:27.160
He was proclaiming the words of life and he served the Lord faithfully.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.960
Until his very last moment, he said, the time of my departure is at hand, but I have fought

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.640
a good fight.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.119
If God has you here, He has a purpose for you.

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:44.559
And we're to do good works, we're to not again to be saved or to stay saved, but because

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:47.239
we are saved, we get to serve Him.

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:48.239
Let's pray.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:49.239
Father, we love you.

00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:52.159
Thank you for the privilege of knowing you.

00:48:52.159 --> 00:48:56.679
If there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today they'd be saved.

00:48:56.679 --> 00:49:05.000
Lord, I pray for each child of God that we would evaluate, examine our service to thee.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:12.760
Lord, that you'd help us to serve you humbly, compassionately, passionately, and faithfully.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:21.159
Lord, help us to do all that we do for the audience of one to please you, Lord, singularly.

00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:26.720
But understanding that our service to thee will have an impact on many.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:31.159
Help us, Lord, to serve you as we ought.

00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:35.919
I pray that you'd move and work in our midst as only you can, that decisions would be made

00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:38.840
that would please thee and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.239
Would you stand?
