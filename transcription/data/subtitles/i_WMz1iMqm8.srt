1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
11 this evening, Luke chapter 11.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:10,319
And we, last Wednesday evening, started a mini-series, if you will, on this, going through

3
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:16,239
this familiar passage of Scripture, the first few verses of Luke chapter 11.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,680
As we started this mini-service, series, excuse me, I used as our title last week from verse

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,799
number 11, Lord, teach us to pray.

6
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:30,920
And as we began studying this passage of Scripture, we find that our Lord was met with

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,040
a request upon finishing His season of prayer.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,959
The Bible tells us that it came to pass in verse number 1, that as He was praying in

9
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:47,439
a certain place, when He ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to

10
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,319
pray, as John also taught his disciples.

11
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:58,799
We spent some time last week speaking about the simplicity of this request, and really,

12
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,479
we find that of all the things that the disciples could have asked the Lord Jesus Christ to

13
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,080
teach them, they said, teach us to pray.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,559
We understand, as we look at the subject matter of prayer, I mentioned last week that it's

15
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:19,239
easier for us to talk about prayer, it's easier for me to teach and preach about prayer than

16
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:28,480
it is for us to actually pray, and to labor and to work at prayer, to engage in that spiritual

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,239
warfare, if you will, of prayer.

18
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:37,279
I believe this evening, as I mentioned last week, that we need a revival of prayer, a

19
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:43,040
revival of prayer in our lives individually, in our families, in our nation, of course

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
our churches.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,959
We need a revival of prayer.

22
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,599
And you know, prayer is really the greatest expression of our dependence upon the Lord.

23
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,279
And we seek His face in prayer, yes, we are to worship Him and adore Him, but we seek

24
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:04,239
His face and we understand that He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,559
we ask or think.

26
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:13,059
Someone, as they were discussing and describing the early church, the first century believers,

27
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:15,020
they made this observation.

28
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,339
They said that the early church, the first century church, didn't have a prayer meeting,

29
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,179
they were a prayer meeting.

30
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,320
I thought that was pretty interesting.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,059
And so often, when you read through the book of Acts, you see how that they were engaged

32
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:33,339
in prayer, of course, as you start in chapter number one and two, and you begin to see how

33
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:38,059
that they were praying in the upper room, and with one accord, and so on and so forth.

34
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:43,259
And we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, as He received the request in verse number

35
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,300
one, that He responded to them.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,259
In verse number two, it says, And He said unto them, When ye pray, say.

37
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,020
And we'll just look at the first phrase this evening.

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:01,139
I want you to understand that Jesus responded to the disciples by giving them a model for

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,139
prayer.

40
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,699
So often, this portion of Scripture in the sister passage in Matthew chapter number six

41
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,020
is referred to as being the Lord's Prayer.

42
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm sure that many of you have heard that before.

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,139
Someone says, this is the Lord's Prayer, or they'll say, do you know the Lord's Prayer?

44
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,899
And this is what they're referring to.

45
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:23,139
I would argue that the Lord's Prayer is in John 17, when He prays to His Father before

46
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,139
He would go to the cross of Calvary.

47
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,580
And here is a model prayer.

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,020
If I could say this, it's the framework for prayer.

49
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,940
The words that Jesus gives, the truth that He's going to communicate to the disciples

50
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,940
was not designed to simply be rehearsed in some exact phraseology.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,660
It was not that they would memorize the words that Jesus said and then just repeat them

52
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
as this is prayer.

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,699
It wasn't the idea of what Jesus was giving the disciples in this passage of Scripture.

54
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,380
It's more of a model or framework for prayer.

55
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,080
If you are taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message, Our Father Which

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,259
Art in Heaven.

57
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,979
Jesus said, when ye pray.

58
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:17,660
I made note last week that He did not say, if ye pray, but He said, when ye pray.

59
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,420
It was an expectation that the people of God would pray.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,540
We understand that He says, when ye pray, say, Our Father Which Art in Heaven.

61
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,779
And this evening, I seek to keep it extremely simple.

62
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,739
There's nothing complicated about the passage of Scripture, but if we would get the truth

63
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:42,980
of God's Word and we would understand the significance and the importance of engaging

64
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,720
in prayer and the power in prayer, I don't know what God could do.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
Because the Bible says that He's able to do exceeding, abundantly above all that you ask

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,559
or think.

67
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,920
If we'd just be a praying people, a praying people.

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,720
I said last week that prayer is often neglected.

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,119
It's often been, and this is pre-pandemic, by the way.

70
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:12,320
We understand how the pandemic affects church attendance, broadly speaking.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,359
But on any given week, broadly, before the pandemic began, Wednesday evening prayer meeting

72
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,320
would be the least attended service for most churches.

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,839
It's prayer meeting, and it's the least attended service.

74
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,279
No wonder our churches are lacking power.

75
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,399
We need prayer.

76
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,600
Notice with me that Jesus, the first thing He says, we're just going to break this statement

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,399
up into two phrases, number one, Our Father.

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,720
Our Father.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,559
We understand that at the onset, as you begin to look at the model, the framework by which

80
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:51,720
Jesus answers the disciple, and as He's speaking to the group of disciples that are there,

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,820
He says to begin to say, Our Father.

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,839
We recognize immediately that there's an awareness of who it is that we're speaking to, who it

83
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,519
is that we're praying to.

84
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,720
What we find that here is acknowledged is the relationship that we have.

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Our Father.

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,500
Now, that which permits me to pray is the fact that I have a relationship.

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,079
That which grants me access, we understand the Lord Jesus Christ, there's one mediator

88
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:27,519
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, and we understand that through the reconciling

89
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,079
work of Calvary, that we as the children of God, because we've been adopted in the family

90
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,640
of God, that we now have access to the throne room of heaven.

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,519
Isn't that amazing?

92
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,519
Our Father.

93
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:47,040
Now, we think about the relationship, and you understand that immediately that comes

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,519
within focus of the instruction that the Lord Jesus Christ would give to these disciples,

95
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,359
and we think about the approach that we have, or this approach in prayer, that it reminds

96
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,040
us of that relationship that we're a child of God.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,760
I think about the access that a child has to their parents.

98
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:13,559
I think about the access that my children have to me as their earthly father, as them

99
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,200
being my children.

100
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,880
They have a certain access that other people don't have, right?

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,320
And I remember as a child, I had a certain element, and still even to this day, I have

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,679
certain access to my parents because I'm their child.

103
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,079
I heard a story today, actually it's kind of interesting that I heard it today, there

104
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,920
was a little boy that was trying to get into a meeting that was taking place years ago,

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
D.L. Moody was preaching.

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,079
Of course, he's been with the Lord for a long, long time now, but he was preaching in a particular

107
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,519
city, and this little boy had heard that D.L. Moody was speaking, and he tried to get into

108
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,760
the service, and no one would permit him into the service.

109
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,959
They said he was too dirty to come into the church.

110
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,880
He was just kind of a young kid, and he was just kind of, had been not well kept and what

111
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,320
have you, and he was standing out on the doorsteps, or on the steps leading up to the doorway,

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,519
and he was really just down and defeated and discouraged because he could not get into

113
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:17,119
this meeting, and little did he know, up coming those steps was D.L. Moody himself.

114
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:22,679
And D.L. Moody said to that young child, he said, why is it, son, that you're so discouraged?

115
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:26,839
He said, because I'm trying to get in because I heard that D.L. Moody was preaching and

116
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,959
no one will let me in.

117
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,039
And D.L. Moody grabbed that little boy's hand and walked up the steps with him, and the

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,359
ushers that would not permit that boy just moments ago opened the doors wide open and

119
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,359
let him walk in.

120
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,520
And what made the difference?

121
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,719
Well, he was with somebody that had access.

122
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:54,599
He wasn't the son of D.L. Moody, but D.L. Moody took that opportunity to bring him in,

123
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,520
and when he otherwise could not enter.

124
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,919
I think about the passage here in this instruction of our Lord when he says, our Father.

125
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,679
Go back to John, if you will, or go over to the book of John, and chapter number one.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,559
I want to look at just a few verses of Scripture and get through this evening, and we'll spend

127
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,559
time in prayer.

128
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,960
As you know, last week we spent more time in prayer than we have on Wednesday evenings,

129
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
purposed in doing that.

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,440
But in John 1 and verse number 12, the Bible says, but as many as received him, to them

131
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,679
gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.

132
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,159
You see the phrase there, that he gave them power to become the sons of God.

133
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,960
What a joy it is to know that we've been adopted in the family of God, that we are

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
the children of God, the son of God.

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,559
Go to the book of Galatians, if you will, in the fourth chapter of the book of Galatians.

136
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,400
I want you to notice what the apostle Paul is saying here to these believers in the region

137
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
of Galatians.

138
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,719
Verse number four of Galatians, chapter number four, the Bible says, but when the fullness

139
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,280
of the time was come.

140
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,920
God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law.

141
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
What was the purpose?

142
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Verse 5, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,600
sons.

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:22,640
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying,

145
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Abba, Father.

146
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,060
Verse 7, wherefore, thou art no more a servant, but a son.

147
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,800
And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

148
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,600
Jesus says, when you pray, say, Our Father.

149
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,720
That relationship that we have with God because of the substitutionary atonement, because

150
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,380
of the work at Calvary, that which was accomplished.

151
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,400
That we now have this privileged position as being the children of God to have access

152
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,920
to the throne room of the Father.

153
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
Notice if you will, in Matthew chapter number 7.

154
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
In Matthew chapter number 7, we know that this portion of Scripture that we're looking

155
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
at in Luke 11, the sister passages in Matthew chapter number 6, but I want you to look in

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,780
Matthew 7 just for a moment to think about this relationship truth that is given to

157
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,040
us with regard to prayer.

158
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,360
In Matthew chapter 7, in verse number 7, the Bible says, Ask, and it shall be given unto

159
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
you.

160
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Seek, and ye shall find.

161
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

162
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,560
For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth.

163
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
And to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,240
Notice this truth that Jesus gives in verses 9 through 11.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,080
The Bible says, Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him

166
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
a stone?

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,440
Brother Armando, you're sitting up here in the front, and one of your boys come to you

168
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
and say, Daddy, I'm hungry.

169
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I need something to eat.

170
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Are you going to give him a stone?

171
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,880
You're going to try to give him some substance, something to eat.

172
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,720
There were times as a child that I was hungry, and I would go and say, I'm hungry.

173
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm thankful I never was given stones to eat.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,720
Notice what he says, Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

175
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,680
Now you know quite well that my dad would not give me a serpent.

176
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Amen?

177
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,440
I mean, that'd be the last thing that he'd ever give me.

178
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,520
But you understand what he's saying here.

179
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:46,200
And then notice this in verse number 11, If ye then, being evil, know how to give good

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
gifts unto your children.

181
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:59,880
Notice these three words, How much more shall your Father, which is in heaven, give good

182
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,920
things to them that ask him?

183
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,440
Wow.

184
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,160
I mean, just let it resonate in your heart.

185
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,120
Our Father, He's a good God.

186
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,160
As a parent, as a human father, there are times in which I know that maybe the request

187
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
of my children is something they really don't need.

188
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,020
It's something that's not going to be good for them at this moment in their life at this

189
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,400
particular time.

190
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,040
And so perhaps as an earthly father, I would say, No, not at this time.

191
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,440
You know, God knows what we need, what our needs are.

192
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,680
If you go through and you kind of back up into the sixth chapter, you find in verse

193
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,240
number eight, it says, Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what

194
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,160
things ye have need of before ye ask him.

195
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,440
I remember there was a time, I don't remember how many years ago it was, but it seemed like

196
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,880
every day around the same hour, Holly and I would get the same question, What's going

197
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
to be for dinner?

198
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,320
Gianna, you like getting that question from all those children?

199
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,800
Mommy, what's for dinner?

200
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,040
You know what I try to tell my kids at one point?

201
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,600
Listen, Mommy and Daddy know that you need to eat, right?

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,240
We know that you need to eat, and there's going to be a meal provided.

203
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
Just hold on.

204
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
See, God knows exactly what we need.

205
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,280
He knows when we need it.

206
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,240
He's our Father.

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
He's our Father.

208
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,920
Jesus said, when those, that, excuse me, disciple said, Lord, teach us to pray.

209
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:45,840
He looks to the disciples and he says, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.

210
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,920
I think about that phrase, and look over in Revelation 4 if you will, look at just a few

211
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
verses here.

212
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,640
When we look in Revelation chapter number 4, I want you to see what the Scriptures show

213
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
us here.

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,960
Of course, the letters have been written to the churches.

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,320
The Bible tells us in Revelation 4, After this I looked, and behold, a door was opened

216
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
in heaven.

217
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,840
The first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said,

218
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,240
Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

219
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Notice verse 2 of Revelation 4, And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne

220
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,520
was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

221
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,640
We don't have time to read all of the fourth chapter of the book of Revelation, but when

222
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,960
we look at the truth of what Jesus is giving to the disciples and we understand that He

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:49,880
says, Our Father which art in heaven, we understand and we must acknowledge and remember as we

224
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,760
enter into our season of prayer that we are praying to Jehovah God, to the God of the

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:03,400
universe, the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God, that is who we are praying to.

226
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,280
And when I think about that truth and understand that He is ruler of all and we understand

227
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,360
various aspects of the Old Testament and how many of the patriarchs and the heroes of the

228
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,760
faith, how they would pray, and we don't have time to look at all of the examples, but if

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,160
you go back to the Old Testament, you'll find oftentimes that those great prayers that were

230
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,400
mindful of, that they will pray to God, to the Lord that is in heaven.

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,240
They understood the position of God.

232
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,920
They understood the authority of God, that He's ruler.

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,840
Let's look at just a few of those examples, Deuteronomy chapter number four, if you will,

234
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,720
and look at what Moses would prepare the children of Israel for as they would, of course, at

235
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,880
this juncture in their history, they have completed that wilderness wandering period

236
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,320
and now they're preparing to enter into the land of promise.

237
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,240
And we find the Bible says this in Deuteronomy four and verse 39, know therefore this day

238
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,960
and consider it in thine heart that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth

239
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,880
beneath, there is none else.

240
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Psalm 11, and we'll look at Psalm 115 and move back to the New Testament.

241
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:35,880
Psalm 11 and verse number four, the Bible says this, the Lord is in His holy temple.

242
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,260
The Lord's throne is in heaven.

243
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,640
His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men, and then turn over, if you will, to

244
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Psalm 115.

245
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,000
And I want you to look, we'll read several verses here in Psalm 115, and there's a contrast

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that takes place here in Psalm 115 between the Lord God, Jehovah, and the idols that

247
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
are mentioned in this passage.

248
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,280
We find in Psalm 115 and verse number one, the Bible says, not unto us, O Lord, not unto

249
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,760
us, but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake, wherefore should

250
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,800
the heathen say, where is now their God?

251
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,640
But our God is in the heavens.

252
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,680
He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.

253
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,200
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

254
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,480
They have mouths, but they speak not, eyes have they, but they see not.

255
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,760
They have ears, but they hear not, noses have they, but they smell not.

256
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,800
They have hands, but they handle not, feet have they, but they walk not, neither speak

257
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,040
they through their throat.

258
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,680
They that make them are like unto them, so is everyone that trusteth in them.

259
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,080
Isn't it interesting that a man would fashion an idol with his hands, he would fashion it,

260
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,920
and then he would worship it.

261
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,480
He would worship that which he had created, that which he had designed.

262
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,000
But we understand that our God is Jehovah God, he is the creator, he's created us, and

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,440
we are to worship him, and he is in heaven sitting upon his throne.

264
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,600
In verses 9-11, the Bible says, O Israel, trust thou in the Lord, he is their help and

265
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
their shield.

266
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,680
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord, he is their help and their shield.

267
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:32,160
Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord, he is their help and their shield.

268
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,560
As I think about the framework of this prayer that the Lord Jesus Christ would give to the

269
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,880
disciples in Luke chapter number 11, and I think about the first several words, and again

270
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,800
a familiar passage of Scripture.

271
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:57,040
But when we understand and we put this phrase together, our Father which art in heaven,

272
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,480
and we think about the omniscient, omnipotent,

273
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,140
omnipresent God, that He's our Father, that we have a relationship with Him, that when

274
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:15,880
we enter into the prayer room, that when we get on our face before God, that we are praying

275
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:24,300
to the God of the universe, but we have access because of a relationship that was made possible

276
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,840
through the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

277
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,480
Prayer is our privilege.

278
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,420
It's our privilege.

279
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,800
I know that I said this several weeks ago when we were studying through the book of

280
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,880
Colossians, and I said that oftentimes you would hear throughout just maybe the several

281
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,360
decades of your life, you would hear people use the phraseology, I'll pray for you, and

282
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,440
when we understand that as the people of God, the children of God, brothers and sisters

283
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,240
in Christ, if you tell me that you're going to pray for me, I have an expectation that

284
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,940
you're praying to the God of the universe, to Jehovah God, and we have some common ground

285
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,160
as to whom we're praying to.

286
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,880
Today, it's more often that you hear somebody say, instead of I'm praying for you, I'm thinking

287
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
of you.

288
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm not sure exactly all that that means, but I know that prayer is our privilege as

289
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,160
the children of God.

290
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,080
That we can go, listen, think about what the book of Hebrews says in Hebrews 4 and

291
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,440
verse number 16, and we studied, of course, through the book of Hebrews last year, but

292
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,360
when you think about that truth, when he says this, let us, therefore, come boldly unto

293
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,200
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

294
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,720
What is it that gives us access to that throne of grace, that we can come boldly unto the

295
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,640
throne of grace?

296
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,320
Because we've been given an invitation as the children of God.

297
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,840
Listen, at any time, my children can say, Daddy, can I talk to you?

298
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,080
I need to talk to you.

299
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,280
And I'm going to do everything I can to get, and I'm not omniscient and omnipresent, and

300
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,560
I can't do all kinds of multitasking, but I'm going to do everything I can to give them

301
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
my attention.

302
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,360
I'm not going to put them off.

303
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,080
No, sorry, not right now.

304
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,280
I'm not going to have a secretary say, do you have an appointment?

305
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,040
You understand what I'm saying?

306
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,600
You know, there are some people that if you tried to contact them right now, you wouldn't

307
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
be able to.

308
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
You just wouldn't be able to.

309
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
You don't have access.

310
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm talking about people that are human beings that you don't have access to.

311
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I don't think any of us have access to the President of the United States, that we can

312
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
just say, hey...

313
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,080
In fact, just last week, somebody tried to show up at the White House and say, I had

314
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
an appointment with the President.

315
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
It didn't work out well for him.

316
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,160
We don't have that kind of access.

317
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,960
He's just a man, but our Father, which art in heaven...

318
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,160
When we pray, we have to understand in grasp, and I think what Jesus was seeking to communicate

319
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,800
to the disciples, and by way of preservation for us this evening, I believe what sought

320
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:26,240
to be communicated to us is that when you pray, do you really have an awareness of who

321
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,320
you're praying to?

322
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,920
That He is the God of the universe, but He's your Father.

323
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,280
He's your Father.

324
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:45,360
Many people around the world, steeped in religion, blinded by the enemy, do all sorts of things

325
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,720
to appease their, quote-unquote, gods to find access.

326
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,160
In fact, if you were to read back in the time in which Elijah would call down fire from

327
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,320
heaven, and you would look at that passage of Scripture, those followers of Baal, those

328
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,880
worshipers of Baal, they were doing all sorts of crazy things to try to get Baal to answer,

329
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
were they not?

330
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,600
For hours, to the point where they're cutting themselves, they're doing all of these things,

331
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,560
but there was no answer.

332
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,880
Elijah prays, and fire comes from heaven.

333
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,520
See, we have access to the throne room of heaven, and we pray, we get to see God work.

334
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,680
We get to see what God is able to do.

335
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,880
The disciples said, Lord, teach us to pray.

336
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,040
And Jesus said, when you pray, say, our Father, which art in heaven.

337
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,560
Be mindful when you pray of the relationship that allows you access, that you're a son

338
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,800
of God, that we're able to cry, Abba, Father.

339
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
He's our God.

340
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,280
He's our Father, which art in heaven.

341
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
He's the ruler of the universe.

342
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,280
He's the ruler of all, yet He's my Father.

343
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,960
Isn't that awesome?

344
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,680
And we really understand, and this is so foundational, but when you understand the significance of

345
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:23,680
this, I believe that it will help us to be more active in praying, because we're understanding

346
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:30,920
who we're praying to, what gives us the ability to pray, that access, and who He is, what

347
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,280
He's able to accomplish.

348
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,800
We'll continue to walk our way very slowly through the passage of Scripture in Luke 11,

349
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,840
and just try to be helped, because we need a revival of prayer.

350
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,280
God answers prayer.

351
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,320
God moves through prayer.

352
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Let's pray together.

353
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Father, we love You.

354
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,660
We thank You for loving us.

355
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,840
Thank You for Your Word, the simplicity of Your Word.

356
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:06,240
God, I pray that if there's one present, or perhaps one that's watching on livestream

357
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,880
that has never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior, that they do not have this

358
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,680
access by which we're speaking.

359
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,960
They cannot say, our Father, because they've not been adopted into the family of God.

360
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,920
They're not a son of God.

361
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,320
I pray that they would get saved.

362
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,320
They would understand that there's only one Savior.

363
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,160
We sang about the blood to begin our service, and that salvation is through the blood of

364
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,560
Christ, the work of Calvary, His death-bearing, glorious resurrection.

365
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,680
Father, I pray for Your people, each of us, Lord, that are gathered tonight, each one

366
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,880
that's heard the message this evening, simple truth.

367
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,640
God, would You help us to rejoice greatly in this unique privilege that You've given

368
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,440
us, that we would acknowledge and be mindful every time that we enter into Your presence

369
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,560
that You are the God of the universe, that You rule and reign, that You're our Father.

370
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,360
You're our Father.

371
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
We can come to You.

372
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,680
We can, because of that relationship and understanding who You are, we can come and know that You're

373
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,200
a good God, a good Father.

374
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,000
As the passage said in Matthew 7, how much more?

375
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,280
I'm so thankful for the truth of Your Word.

376
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,080
I pray that You'd motivate us, Lord, and move us, that Your Holy Spirit would work in our

377
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:49,720
hearts and convict us in this area of prayer, that we would truly have a revival of prayer.

378
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,060
Bless our time as we have corporate prayer this evening.

379
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,560
We do thank You for the privilege.

380
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,320
Pray that You'd be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
