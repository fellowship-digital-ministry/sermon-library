1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
and certainly appreciate it and trust it's been a blessing to you. In our last

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:09,119
message we entered into the third chapter of the book of Colossians and

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,000
as we did we mentioned that the book would turn and be a little more

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,440
practical in nature if you will and so thankful that God's Word is practical

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,719
amen it's to be applied in our lives were to be doers of the word and not

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,959
hearers only. We find that as we entered into this third chapter of the book of

7
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:33,959
Colossians that we were immediately faced with these three verses that

8
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:40,040
encourage us to be mindful of our position in Christ and I'm so thankful

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,700
for the salvation of these believers in Colossi that Paul is writing to and I'm

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,720
thankful this morning to know that heaven is my home and that I have been

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,639
adopted in the family of God that I understood that I was a sinner in need

12
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:59,799
of a Savior and that Jesus Christ is the only Savior he said there is he

13
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,440
said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm thankful that I can understand as the Word of God teaches us that we are

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,959
secure in Christ our position is so vital and we understand that the

16
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,599
believers in Colossi were encouraged to be mindful of their position and then

17
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,000
they were encouraged to be mindful of their pursuits and when I understand my

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,680
position it has an impact and influence on what I pursue we find that in our

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,839
lives today in our world in our society that people are pursuing all sorts of

20
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:40,639
things and we find that as the people of God we are to be pursuing Christ and

21
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:45,760
we're to be pursuing godliness we're to hunger and thirst after righteousness

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,239
and what a blessing to be mindful of these two wonderful truths that we find

23
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,440
here in Colossians 3 verses 1 through 3 we understand that this epistle was

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,319
initially delivered to the believers in Colossi approximately nineteen hundred

25
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,279
and sixty years ago that's a long time ago and it was delivered to these

26
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:11,199
believers nineteen hundred and sixty years ago but the truths that are

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,880
contained therein are still applicable and relevant for us today in fact I

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,039
bring up specifically the time frame of the writing of the book of Colossians

29
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,919
because as we approach a verse number four which will be our text for this

30
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,520
morning we find that this truth that was being referenced the event that was

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,080
being referenced and given to these believers in Colossi has not yet taken

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,600
place though we have full confidence that it will take place we find that as

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,800
we look at the Word of God and we study the Bible we would come away with the

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,360
understanding that the Bible is a gift from God I'm so thankful for the Bible

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,559
I'm thankful that God has given us His Word and as I consider the Word of God

36
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,559
and there are many things that we could say this morning about the Word of God

37
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:07,360
but we'd understand that God's Word is precious it's precious it's more

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,600
valuable than gold or silver or rubies or precious stones is more valuable than

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,520
any of those things for the Word of God is eternal and it's a precious book and

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,839
we ought to view it and understand it as being precious we understand that

41
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:27,080
this book that we hold not only is it precious but it's powerful it's powerful

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,000
listen the Word of God had the power to change your life and to change my life

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,399
and I'm thankful that God says that His Word is alive it's quick and it's

44
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:39,199
powerful and it's sharper than a two-edged sword I'm thankful for the

45
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,839
power of the Word of God and when we understand the the power of God's Word

46
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:48,119
it helps us understand why the admonition throughout the New Testament

47
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:53,720
is to preach the Word why because the Word of God is powerful we find that

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,839
this book that we hold in our hands it's preserved I'm thankful that God Almighty

49
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:04,360
who is eternal that He has given the promise to preserve His Word His Word is

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,919
forever settled in heaven and He said that He's given us His Word and that

51
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,440
He'll preserve it from this generation forever and I'm so thankful that we have

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,679
a preserved Word of God that we can have the confidence when we go to the

53
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:24,839
Word of God to know that this indeed is the Word of God it's profitable it's

54
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,600
profitable hasn't God's Word helped you in your life the Bible says that of

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,480
itself that it's a lamp unto our feet that it guides us and it leads us we

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,640
understand that Paul as he's writing to Timothy he says that all Scripture is

57
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:43,079
given by inspiration of God and he says that it's profitable and he lists

58
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,000
several things that it's profitable for and we understand this morning that God's

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Word is profitable but I also understand this morning that God's Word is

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,519
prophetical the prophecy of God's Word we find that as you study the the whole

61
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,519
of God's Word and we understand that as we look at the truth of God's Word that

62
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,519
God is eternal is no beginning and no end he created time he's outside of time

63
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:16,320
and yet he has provided us a book that records for us all of the history of

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,839
mankind that he wants us to have and as we look at this verse of Scripture in

65
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,320
Colossians 3 and verse number 4 and we will unwrap the eschatological truth of

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,959
this verse but there's a parenthetical statement that deserves our attention

67
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:39,359
notice with me in Colossians 3 and verse number 4 the Bible says this when Christ

68
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:51,119
who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory if you

69
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,920
have your bulletin today you've already seen that the title for the message is

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,720
when Christ shall appear we know that he came the first time and we're awaiting

71
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,959
his second return we find that as we look at the Word of God and we

72
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,320
understand the truth that is contained herein that I mentioned that there's

73
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,959
this parenthetical statement that deserves our attention if you're taking

74
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,000
notes I would simply point out this morning number one there is a distinct

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,359
perspective there's a distinct perspective the Apostle Paul is he's

76
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:25,160
writing to the believers in Colossae not only would he impart truth to these

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,519
believers but we find that just as the cases with many of the epistles that

78
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,320
Paul was used as the human penman to author that he would also share with the

79
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
believers that he would write to his own perspective and he would share many

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,760
things about his own life we find that this man Paul he was converted on the

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,839
road to Damascus and God changed his life and God called him and God placed a

82
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,000
specific calling upon the life of Paul and we find as we read throughout the

83
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:00,480
Word of God that you would find that God gives us the record of many of the

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,519
accomplishments if you will of the Apostle Paul and how God used Paul for

85
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,920
his honor and for his glory and what a blessing to read about and study the

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,040
life of Paul then you understand that Paul himself had the perspective that he

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,399
was the chief of sinners you understand that Paul understood that that in his

88
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,200
flesh dwelleth no good thing the Apostle Paul understood that he was what he was

89
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,320
by the grace of God but as he shares his perspective and I believe it's a

90
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,600
distinct perspective here in our text of Scripture this parenthetical statement

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,640
notice what he says in verse number four when Christ notice the phrase who is our

92
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:50,600
life Wow I mean that's a simple yet impactful statement in fact I believe

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,279
this morning that if you're not careful as you read the Word of God that you

94
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,000
could quickly pass over such a statement no doubt when we read the Bible there

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,279
are times in which we'll have various things going on and distractions would

96
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,239
persist and we would find that perhaps we miss something here and there or

97
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,000
maybe we have the busyness of our day in our schedule when we read a little too

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,600
quickly if you will and we can miss simple statements in the Word of God but

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,559
how impactful this statement is when Christ who is our life I believe that

100
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,720
this statement here in verse number four ought to stop each and every one of us

101
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,479
in our tracks and cause us to evaluate can I say as Paul said that Christ is my

102
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,400
life can you say as Paul said could the believers in Colossae say as Paul said

103
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:56,559
he Christ is our life the reality is that he is the one who gives life it is

104
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,880
only by God's grace that you're living at this very moment but we also

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,719
understand that is only through God that he gives eternal life the Bible says in

106
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:10,679
Romans chapter number six that the gift of God is eternal life aren't you

107
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,200
thankful for the gift of God it's through Jesus Christ our Lord because he

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,159
went to that cross of Calvary we sang about the cross this morning and how he

109
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,440
went to that old rugged cross and he bled and he died to pay for the sin of

110
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,840
mankind to pay for your sin and my sin the reality is that we're all sinners

111
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,679
and sin requires a payment and as I shared with someone just recently

112
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,280
there's only one payment that's acceptable for the sin of mankind and

113
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,239
that is the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you can't work your way to

114
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,520
heaven you can't give enough to get to heaven there's nothing you can do in of

115
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,520
yourself to get to heaven it's all in what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary

116
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,200
and he has given us eternal life the reality is that in John chapter number

117
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,159
10 in verse number 10 the Bible says that he came as the Good Shepherd and he

118
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,159
gives life and he gives life to the world

119
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,479
He gives it more abundantly.

120
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,839
What a blessing and what a joy

121
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,599
to have the abundant life.

122
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,599
Some of you remember what life was like

123
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,399
before salvation.

124
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,799
You remember what life was like

125
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,019
and the reality is that life now

126
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,079
as a child of God is so much better,

127
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,239
is so much different than what we had

128
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,799
prior to being a Christian.

129
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,719
No longer am I living just for the here and now.

130
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,279
I get to enjoy the blessings of God here and now,

131
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,799
but the reality is that I'm heaven bound

132
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,239
and I have this life that He's given me.

133
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,679
And when I understand that He's given life,

134
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,559
when I understand all of the blessings

135
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,119
that He's bestowed upon us,

136
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,479
and we find that Paul makes this statement

137
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:54,479
when Christ, who is our life.

138
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,159
I wonder this morning,

139
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,439
can we make in honesty before the Lord,

140
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,619
can we make that statement?

141
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,619
The reality is that I believe that even still today,

142
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,819
people continue to use this expression

143
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,539
that is used here in this verse of Scripture.

144
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,299
My life is baseball.

145
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,859
Baseball is their life,

146
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,659
or this thing is their life,

147
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,379
or maybe a parent says of a child,

148
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,299
they're my life,

149
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,219
or a spouse says of their spouse,

150
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:21,059
they're my life.

151
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,659
We understand the statement.

152
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,619
People use it still to this day.

153
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,759
What does this statement mean?

154
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,039
What is it that we would understand

155
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,119
when someone would say of their child

156
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,479
that's so enthralled with a particular aspect

157
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,839
of maybe it's a sport

158
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,159
or maybe it's some type of activity,

159
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,959
and the parent would say,

160
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,639
as they would observe their child,

161
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,679
and maybe there's an onlooker,

162
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,519
and they would say,

163
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,119
well, you know, that's just their life.

164
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,719
What do they mean by that?

165
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,959
What does that Paul means by this statement?

166
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,559
I believe that we would understand it

167
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,799
to be used to designate someone

168
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,799
or something that would have preeminence in our lives.

169
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,919
And can I submit to you this morning

170
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,339
that there's only one person

171
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,799
that should have the preeminence in your life

172
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,219
and in my life,

173
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,959
and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.

174
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,639
When Paul says when Christ,

175
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,639
who is our life,

176
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,099
it's the Lord Jesus Christ

177
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,439
that deserves that place of preeminence

178
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,959
in your life and in my life.

179
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,079
And we find that Paul understood that

180
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,319
because of his conversion.

181
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:32,919
You understand that Christ was not his life

182
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,559
in the same sense that we would look at this statement

183
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,879
prior to his conversion,

184
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,599
just as Christ was not your life

185
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,799
prior to your conversion.

186
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,759
If you can look back before you were saved

187
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,519
and you could think of maybe some pursuits

188
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,759
and some things that you were seeking after,

189
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,159
and someone would say of you,

190
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,519
this is their life,

191
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,759
this is their pursuit,

192
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,559
this is what is preeminent in their lives.

193
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,919
In fact, there are times in which

194
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,639
you can speak to people and you know

195
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,999
that if you get on a certain subject or topic

196
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,199
that you've found the thing that is their life.

197
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,959
Because they just can't stop talking about it.

198
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,959
I wonder,

199
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,879
is Christ our life?

200
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,279
That we get talking about the Lord

201
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,599
and we just kind of can't stop talking about Him.

202
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,839
Because of how good He is

203
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,159
and all that He's done for us.

204
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,839
Remember what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5

205
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,599
and verse 15 holds your place here

206
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,279
in the book of Colossians, if you will.

207
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,079
And I want you to notice what Paul says

208
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
here in this passage of Scripture.

209
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,799
Paul understood what the Lord did for him

210
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,359
and he says this in 2 Corinthians 5,

211
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,839
and that He died for all.

212
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,879
It's a universal truth that the Lord Jesus Christ

213
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,519
died for the sin of mankind.

214
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,759
For all.

215
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,759
It says this, that they which live

216
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,359
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

217
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,999
but unto Him which died for them

218
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,439
and rose again.

219
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,519
What a great truth.

220
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,159
When Christ, who is our life,

221
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,439
notice in Colossians 1 and verse 18,

222
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,319
and we studied this several months ago

223
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,599
as we studied through the first chapter

224
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,559
of the book of Colossians,

225
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,199
when Paul gives this great section

226
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,879
with regard to the Person of Jesus Christ

227
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,959
and what magnitude we find in this text

228
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,359
and how beautiful it is,

229
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,439
but we find in verse 18 that he says this

230
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,639
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

231
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,919
that He is the head of the body of the church,

232
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,119
who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,

233
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,599
that in how many things?

234
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,039
All things.

235
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,519
He might have the preeminence.

236
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,239
Listen, I don't expect Christ to have

237
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,159
the preeminence in the life of an unbeliever.

238
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,559
Do you?

239
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,919
No, they're lost.

240
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,399
In the life of a child of God?

241
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,879
Someone that's been born again?

242
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,559
Remember, Paul's writing to the saints

243
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,079
and faithful brethren in Christ

244
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,159
which are at Colossae according to v. 2

245
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,319
of chapter 1,

246
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,599
and as I understand my position in Christ

247
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,599
and I understand what He's done for me,

248
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,479
and I understand that in all things,

249
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,679
not in some things, not in most things,

250
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,199
but in all things,

251
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,359
He must have the preeminence.

252
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,479
And Paul says when Christ,

253
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:14,479
who is our life,

254
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,959
that's a simple yet impactful statement.

255
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,039
I'm going to read to you the words of a song.

256
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,799
Mr. Thompson, Mr. Will Thompson

257
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,279
penned the words to this song.

258
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,039
It's number 100 in our song book.

259
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,239
The title of the song is

260
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:34,359
Jesus is all the world to me.

261
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,599
Listen to what Mr. Thompson said.

262
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,919
Jesus is all the world to me.

263
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,119
My life, my joy, my all.

264
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,079
He is my strength from day to day.

265
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,479
Without Him, I would fall.

266
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:53,039
When I am sad, to Him I go.

267
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,559
No other one can cheer me so.

268
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,359
When I am sad, He makes me glad.

269
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,479
He is my friend.

270
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,119
Jesus is all the world to me.

271
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,079
My friend in trials sore.

272
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,599
I go to Him for blessings

273
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,879
and He gives them o'er and o'er.

274
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,799
He sends the sunshine and the rain.

275
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,879
He sends the harvest, golden grain.

276
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,119
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain.

277
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,199
He is my friend.

278
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,319
Jesus is all the world to me

279
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,879
and true to Him I'll be.

280
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,999
Oh, how could I this friend deny

281
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,959
when He's so true to me.

282
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,159
Following Him, I know I'm right.

283
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,719
He watches o'er me day and night.

284
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,439
Following Him by day and night,

285
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,239
He's my friend.

286
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,039
The final verse of this wonderful hymn,

287
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,159
Jesus is all the world to me.

288
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,439
I want no better friend.

289
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,959
I trust Him now.

290
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,639
I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end.

291
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,439
Beautiful life with such a friend.

292
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,119
Beautiful life that has no end.

293
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,359
Eternal life, eternal joy.

294
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,959
He's my friend.

295
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,079
Mr. Thompson started this hymn by saying,

296
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,839
Jesus is all the world to me.

297
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,079
My life, my joy, my all.

298
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,839
This man was saved by the blood of Christ.

299
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,039
And he understood that Christ,

300
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,239
who is my life,

301
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,279
He's my all in all.

302
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,199
He's everything to me.

303
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,799
Without Him, as the songwriter said,

304
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,879
I will fail.

305
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,519
I will fall.

306
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,959
Remember, it was the Lord Jesus Christ

307
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,759
in John 10, I referenced a moment ago

308
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,639
when He said that I give them life

309
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:42,079
that they might have it more abundantly,

310
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,199
that He says just a few verses after that,

311
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:49,319
that without Me, ye can do nothing.

312
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,239
I'm so thankful this morning

313
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,919
for this distinct perspective

314
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,279
that is shared with us

315
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,239
in Colossians 3 and verse 4.

316
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:58,079
It's a parenthetical statement,

317
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,719
but oh, how impactful it is.

318
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:04,119
This morning, can we, as Paul said,

319
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,359
and as he sought to encourage

320
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,799
these believers in Colossae,

321
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,959
can we say that Christ is our life?

322
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,639
Notice as we continue to go

323
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,159
through this fourth verse of Colossians 3,

324
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,159
not only is there a distinct perspective,

325
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,279
but there is a declared promise.

326
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,999
I'm thankful for the promises of God's Word.

327
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,759
In fact, we sing about standing on the promises.

328
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,919
It's Peter that says that He's given us

329
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,399
exceeding great and precious promises.

330
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,879
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's Word.

331
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,079
I mentioned to you earlier

332
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,079
by way of introduction

333
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,399
that this book of Colossians

334
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,199
was written nearly 1,960 years ago,

335
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,799
and yet the promise that was given

336
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,519
to these believers in Colossae

337
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,079
that many years ago

338
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,479
still stands true to this very day.

339
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,479
The event has not yet taken place,

340
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,079
but we have full confidence

341
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,279
that in what God has said He will do,

342
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,159
that He indeed will do.

343
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,319
He will bring it to pass.

344
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,679
Remember that Jesus said

345
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,879
to His troubled disciples

346
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,079
when they were nearing the time

347
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,679
of Christ going to Calvary

348
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,519
and Jesus had given them much instruction

349
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,919
with regard to those events

350
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,119
that would unfold in the days ahead.

351
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,440
He says to them in John 14,

352
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,759
let not your heart be troubled.

353
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,919
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

354
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,799
In My Father's house are many mansions.

355
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,719
If it were not so, I would have told you.

356
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,039
I go to prepare a place for you.

357
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,599
And then He makes this statement

358
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,399
in v. 3,

359
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,279
and if I go and prepare a place for you,

360
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,399
I will come again and receive you unto Myself

361
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,919
that where I am, there ye may be also.

362
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,000
There were scoffers during the first century.

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,279
Peter deals with them.

364
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,319
There are scoffers that continue today

365
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,839
that say where is the promise of His return?

366
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,679
But as Peter would say to those scoffers

367
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,039
as he would respond to their attacks,

368
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:50,959
he would say this,

369
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:55,199
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

370
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,239
but is longsuffering to us, Lord,

371
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,000
not willing that any should perish,

372
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
but that all should come to repentance.

373
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,639
I'm thankful that we serve a...

374
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,959
who cannot lie. I'm thankful this morning that we serve a God who is not slack

375
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:11,039
concerning his promise, aren't you? I mean he's never failed and he's not planning

376
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,559
to. We serve the God of the universe and as we look at this declared promise, we

377
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,239
find that the Apostle Paul says this, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear.

378
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:30,239
I like that word shall. It's certain. He doesn't say when Christ might appear or

379
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:36,879
we think he is going to, he could appear. No, no, he shall appear. He's coming. He

380
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:44,159
says this, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. You know the study of

381
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,759
eschatology is fascinating. The study of end times. We find that our God, as I

382
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,159
mentioned earlier, he is eternal so he is able to provide us with a timeline that

383
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,399
stretches from creation to eternity. In fact, as you study the Word of God, he

384
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:07,599
gives us insight even to events prior to creation for the Bible tells us that

385
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,359
Jesus was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world. And we find

386
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,439
that our God is outside of time. It's sometimes hard for us to understand

387
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:22,639
because we are contained within time and everything is time, time, time,

388
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,639
time. We're just so controlled by time. But God is outside of time and he's

389
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:34,199
given us this great truth here and we find that as we study eschatology that

390
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:38,559
we have the opportunity to study the prophecy that God's given as we begin to

391
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,639
think about specifically eschatology with dealing with the prophecy of end

392
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:47,279
times or future events that we'd find that the Word of God gives us much

393
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,759
truth. Here, as we examine this verse of Scripture, I believe that you would

394
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,719
conclude that the event of prophecy that's being addressed here is the

395
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:02,679
second coming of Christ and not the rapture of the church. We understand that

396
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,479
oftentimes we speak about the second coming of Christ and we can use the word

397
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:10,719
kind of interchangeably or the phrase interchangeably to talk about two

398
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:15,279
distinct events on the prophetic calendar. We find that there is a

399
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:20,399
prophecy, an event on the prophetical calendar of the rapture of the church.

400
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:24,719
But then we also find that there's an event on the prophetical calendar in

401
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:29,679
God's Word that deals with his second coming, the second advent, if you will. We

402
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,199
understand that he came the first time just as he said. When the fullness of

403
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:37,559
time was come, God sent forth his Son and he's gonna come the second time right

404
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,559
on time. He's not gonna be a moment late. He's coming just as he is supposed to

405
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,479
and we find that this event that's mentioned here in Colossians 3 and verse

406
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:53,639
number 4 really is dealing with the truth of Revelation 19 and not with

407
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:59,719
1st Thessalonians 4. Now I hope over the next few moments that I can unpack and

408
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:04,119
help understand something in about 20 minutes that could take hours of

409
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:10,559
discussion. So I hope that someone told me I talk fast. I try to slow it down a

410
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,679
little bit, but sometimes I got to talk fast because we got a lot to cover. And

411
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,559
so I'll talk fast if you listen fast. I'm just I'm not gonna go any faster than I

412
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,479
was. But listen, when we look at Colossians 3 and verse number 4, notice

413
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:28,919
the word when the Bible says this, when Christ shall, notice this word appear. When

414
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,959
Christ shall appear. The Bible is very specific. Every word of God is given to

415
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,999
us and we're thankful for every word of God. They're pure words. And here Paul

416
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:44,319
says when Christ shall appear. The word appear means to make actual and visible.

417
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,879
It means this, to become manifest. Now it also says this, that when Christ who is

418
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:58,679
our life shall appear, notice, then shall ye also appear with Christ in God. Now

419
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:05,319
specifically who is Paul speaking to? The ye are the believers in Colossae. We find

420
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,559
that by extension when we understand the prophecy and the promise that is given

421
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,479
here, that ye also includes me. It includes you, the believers, the people

422
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:18,639
that have been saved by the blood of the Lamb. If you're here this morning and you

423
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:23,279
have a 100% confidence that heaven is your home, not because of anything that

424
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,119
you've done, but because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, then

425
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:35,239
ye means you. Because when Christ shall appear, it says this, then shall ye also

426
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,519
appear with him in glory. Yes, specifically he's speaking to believers

427
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,639
in Colossae, but they're saved the same way we're saved. And when we become part

428
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:50,079
of the Bride of Christ, we can join in on the promise that is given. Now

429
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,959
understand with me that as we look at this word appear and understand

430
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,279
that it says that we also shall appear with him in glory, we could ask this

431
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:04,439
question, when does this happen? When is it that this happens? You'd understand

432
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:08,239
that this is not speaking of the rapture, for that event happened

433
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:14,679
suddenly, and believers are caught up to meet the Lord in the air. In fact, as we

434
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,319
look at the truth of the rapture of the church, the Apostle Paul, as he's

435
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,279
speaking to the believers in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 52,

436
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,479
describes that event of the rapture of the church in this manner, in a moment, in

437
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:37,919
the twinkling of an eye. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And we find that

438
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,079
he's discussing in 1 Corinthians 15 the rapture of the church when we are going

439
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,359
to be caught up and to meet the Lord in the air. 1 Thessalonians chapter 4

440
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,919
deals with it in great detail. We find that as we look at that truth in

441
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,439
1 Thessalonians 4 and verse number 13 through 18, and he gives the truth with

442
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:02,879
regard to the rapture of the church, Paul then describes it this way in

443
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:07,559
chapter 5 and verse number 2, that the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in

444
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,039
the night. And so we find here that as we would understand the truth of the

445
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,479
rapture, and we'd understand the terminology that is given that in a

446
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:21,119
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, as a thief in the night, that that's the

447
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,559
rapture. Listen, it's going to happen so quickly. As Brother Sommerdorf mentioned

448
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,159
last Sunday morning as he spoke about the rapture of the church, no one's

449
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,119
going to be able to say, oh man, he's coming and let's do this, that, or the

450
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,839
other thing. No, it's gonna happen just like that. Actually faster than that. And

451
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:47,199
we're gonna be gone. What a joy. Looking for the upper taker, not the undertaker.

452
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:51,399
Amen? That's what Brother Mershon always says. And the reality is that we

453
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,879
understand that Jesus is coming again, but oftentimes we speak out on coming

454
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:58,919
again, we're focused upon the rapture of the church. And that's okay, that's the

455
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,799
next event on the prophetic calendar. Jesus is coming again. We're gonna be

456
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,119
raptured out of here. But he's not going to make himself manifest, he's not gonna

457
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,119
make himself actual or visible in that particular coming, because he's gonna go

458
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,799
in the air. We're gonna meet him in the air, it's just gonna be like that, just

459
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,759
that quickly, and we're gonna meet him in the air. And so here is Paul speaks to

460
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,639
the believers in Colossians, he says, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear,

461
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:30,559
then shall ye also appear with him in glory. So again, when does this event

462
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,959
happen? We find that at the second coming of Christ, when he comes and comes all

463
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:40,239
the way to earth, that what happens, the Bible reveals to us in Revelation 19,

464
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:47,439
we'll look at it in just a moment, that we come with him. We come with him. Not

465
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:51,199
only do we come with him, but the host of the heavenly angels come. I mean, it's

466
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:59,679
gonna be a serious situation. Amen? Listen, he came the first time as a babe, and he

467
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,039
came the first time to die for the sins of mankind. But when he comes again, he's

468
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:12,159
coming to rule and to reign. The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And he's not coming

469
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,159
as a babe in the manger, he's coming as the conquering King of kings and

470
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,119
Lord of lords. And we find that as we look at Revelation 19, that as that event

471
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,479
is given to us in detail, that not only will we return with him, but then

472
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:34,959
the battle of Armageddon ensues, and then we find that the millennial, the literal

473
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:39,519
millennial reign of Christ begins. He will rule and reign for a thousand years

474
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,759
upon the earth. And by the way, we'll rule with him. Isn't that awesome? Look at

475
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,559
Revelation 19 with me, if you will. Now remember, this is the context in which

476
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,639
Paul is sharing with these believers with regard to the when Christ shall

477
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:04,199
appear. Then shall ye also appear with him in glory. And find in Revelation 19,

478
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:12,079
beginning in verse number 11. Revelation 19, beginning in verse number 11, the

479
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,199
Bible says, and I saw heaven opened. Behold, a white horse and he that sat

480
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:23,039
upon him was called Faithful and True. Oh, we could speak for a long time just upon

481
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,359
those two names that are ascribed to our Savior. He's faithful. Aren't you thankful

482
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
for the faithfulness of God? He's dependable. He's trustworthy. Listen,

483
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,999
remember this promise that's given to the church in Colossae 1960 years ago.

484
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:42,719
Why is it that we still have confidence and certainty in this promise? Because

485
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:48,359
he's faithful. He's outside of time. We can sit around and say, where is the

486
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,599
promise of his return? I mean, he said he was gonna come. And in that same passage

487
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,279
of Scripture in 2nd Peter 3, the Bible tells us that a day is as a thousand

488
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:04,639
years as a day. To God, why? Because he's outside of time. Notice, he's faithful.

489
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:11,599
he's faithful, he's true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

490
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:17,099
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written

491
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:22,719
that no man knew but he himself, and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and

492
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:26,559
his name is called the Word of God."

493
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,439
Remember the truth of John 1, in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word

494
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,839
was God.

495
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:37,159
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us in verse number 14, and here his name is the

496
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:38,159
Word of God.

497
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,319
Notice verse 14, and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,

498
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,039
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

499
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,279
Aren't you thankful for that?

500
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,919
Listen, it's not those filthy rags, it's not my own righteousness, I'm clothed in the righteousness

501
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,839
of God Almighty.

502
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,839
Because the Bible tells us that he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that

503
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:06,639
we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

504
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,159
Verse 15, and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, and with it he should smite the nations,

505
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,779
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

506
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:20,519
and wrath of Almighty God, and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written

507
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:27,079
King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

508
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,359
Wow.

509
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:38,199
And he shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

510
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:43,319
These two events that we often refer to and sometimes use interchangeably with regard

511
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,439
to the return of Christ or the second coming of Christ, when we begin to understand the

512
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:53,639
truth of prophecy and we'd study eschatology and the Word of God, and we begin to understand

513
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:57,639
that these two events are separated by seven years.

514
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,519
We understand Daniel's prophecy in Daniel chapter number nine.

515
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,919
I don't have time to unfold all of this, but I hope to whet your appetite enough that you'd

516
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,959
go back and read and study, and I could give you the truth in a summary format this morning

517
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:14,799
that will help us to understand what God desires for us to understand.

518
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,199
I know there's some people that say, I want to know when he's coming.

519
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,519
You're not going to know.

520
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,199
You can study the Bible and come up with all the numerology you want to come up with and

521
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,199
come up with it.

522
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:25,959
God says, no man knoweth the hour.

523
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:30,839
Jesus said, in fact, to his disciples before he ascended to heaven, when they asked him

524
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,359
in Acts chapter number one, now at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel, and he

525
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,079
said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his

526
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:46,479
own power, but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall

527
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,799
be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost

528
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,799
part of the earth.

529
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,799
What are we saying?

530
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,359
You have a job, and your job is not to worry about the date on the calendar that I'm coming

531
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,359
back.

532
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:04,399
You just know that I am coming back, and here's your job, here's your duty, your responsibility

533
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,999
until I should return.

534
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:12,039
And so we begin to study prophecy and we begin to understand what's taking place.

535
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:18,679
We look at these two events prophetically, the return of Christ, looking at the rapture

536
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,359
of the church and his second advent, his second coming, we find that there's a separation

537
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,639
of seven years.

538
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:31,199
I believe this morning that in order for us to properly understand prophecy, it is absolutely

539
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:36,559
essential that we properly understand Israel and the church.

540
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:43,879
There is a grave mistake in which people do not properly understand the distinction between

541
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:47,019
Israel and the church.

542
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:52,099
I read with me clearly this morning that the church is not Israel.

543
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,699
We're not Israel.

544
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,539
We're not spiritual Israel.

545
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,219
Israel is Israel.

546
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:02,899
And by the way, if you read in Romans chapter number 11, and we don't have time to develop

547
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:08,019
all of that either, but if you read in Romans chapter number 11, he's talking about Israel

548
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:09,419
in verse number 25.

549
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:14,899
He says, for I would not, brethren, that ye shall be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye

550
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,579
should be wise in your own conceits.

551
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:23,059
Notice what he says, that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of

552
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,339
the Gentiles become in.

553
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:30,059
He just talked to them about the way in which the Gentiles were graft in and all that was

554
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,059
taking place.

555
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,059
Why?

556
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,899
Because Israel rejected Messiah.

557
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:37,819
And that wasn't a surprise to God, by the way.

558
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,419
He knows everything.

559
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:45,179
And Israel rejected Christ as being Messiah, and therefore the Gentiles were graft in.

560
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,179
The mystery of the church is that the church is distinct from Israel, and it's made up

561
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:57,659
of Jew and Gentile together that are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ.

562
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:00,779
We're a completely separate entity.

563
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,899
Notice also in Romans chapter number 11, in verse number 29, the Bible says, for the gifts

564
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:09,579
and calling of God are without repentance.

565
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,019
You know what he's speaking about?

566
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,619
He's speaking about all of those promises that he gave to Israel in the Old Testament.

567
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:21,939
The promises to Abraham and to the Jewish people and saying of those promises that the

568
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:24,339
gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

569
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:29,339
In other words, just because they turned on God doesn't mean that God's not going to fulfill

570
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,939
what he's promised them.

571
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:33,899
Do you remember the Abrahamic covenant?

572
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:40,259
Abraham was sound asleep when God passed through, signifying that the Lord passed through

573
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:46,299
twice and signifying that these promises were not conditional.

574
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:51,859
They were not dependent upon Israel or Abraham, certainly responding in a certain way, but

575
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,979
they were dependent upon God.

576
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:59,819
We understand in the Word of God that there are some conditional promises.

577
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:03,339
Oftentimes conditional promises in the Word of God look like this.

578
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,939
If then, if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray

579
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:13,419
and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and heal

580
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:14,419
their land.

581
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,579
That's what the second Chronicle 7 in verse number 14.

582
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,619
Proverbs chapter number 2, you look through the passage of Scripture, there's a whole

583
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:24,299
host in just the first 10 verses of if then promises.

584
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:30,499
We find that there are if then promises, but then there are unconditional promises.

585
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:35,259
God says here of Israel that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, and

586
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,939
so Israel is distinct from the church.

587
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:42,819
When we understand that truth, it helps us to understand prophecy.

588
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:48,139
When we blur that truth and we try to make the church spiritual Israel and we try to

589
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,859
do all of these things and spiritualize the text, then we get all kinds of sideways and

590
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:57,339
messed up on understanding the truth that God has given us in his Word.

591
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:02,899
I often have referred to it in this manner, and I don't do a lot of cooking and baking

592
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:05,659
and that sort of thing, but I often refer to it in this manner.

593
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:10,039
If we could use an illustration this morning of one that would be cooking, and perhaps

594
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,899
you're making a dish and you're preparing this elaborate meal, and there's a particular

595
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:19,659
sauce that needs to go with that dish, and you have to do some things in the beginning,

596
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:25,579
but then that sauce is not necessary until the very end of the cooking process.

597
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,179
And what you do with that sauce is maybe if we could use this terminology, you put

598
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:32,779
it on the back burner.

599
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:36,659
It's still maybe simmering a little bit, you've got it on super low heat, it's still kind

600
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:43,099
of simmering, but it's not forgotten about, it's not discarded, but it's not in focus

601
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,379
right now because there are other things to tend to.

602
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:49,339
And you're preparing that meal and you're dealing with that meal and you're putting

603
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:53,179
all of the other ingredients together, and then you come to the end and you've got to

604
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:57,299
take that sauce and bring it back to the front again.

605
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:03,659
If I could use that analogy in explaining to you this way, that in a similar manner,

606
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:09,939
God, because Israel rejected Messiah, He put them on the back burner.

607
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:13,739
It's not that Jews can't be saved today.

608
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,739
Jewish people can still be saved today.

609
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:21,619
Paul, in fact, says, my prayer in God to Israel is that they might be saved in Romans 10 and

610
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:23,039
verse number 1.

611
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,919
There are Jewish people that can be saved, but they have to be saved the same way that

612
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,039
you and I are saved.

613
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,759
They can't just say, well, I'm Jewish and so therefore I'm okay.

614
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:35,119
Doesn't work that way.

615
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,199
So for a season, the church age, a period of time that's not defined in years, God has

616
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:47,899
put Israel on the back burner and He's dealing with the church.

617
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:50,619
The church, the bride of Christ.

618
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:55,739
And as He deals with the church, we find the church age, we find the epistles and all

619
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,939
that's given to us as the church, all of our responsibilities as the bride of Christ.

620
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:12,019
But then at some point, the bride of Christ is gone and Israel comes back on the burner.

621
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:19,179
And so what happens when we understand, again, the truth and the distinction between Israel

622
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:24,459
and the church, it also assists us, it's important that we would understand why.

623
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,899
What is the purpose of the tribulation?

624
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:33,219
The purpose of the tribulation is to deal with Israel again.

625
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:37,499
In fact, Jeremiah says it this way in Jeremiah 30 and verse number 7, he says that it's the

626
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:40,339
time of Jacob's trouble.

627
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,519
The time of Jacob's trouble.

628
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,779
So the church is raptured.

629
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:48,099
In fact, if you read the book of Revelation, you read throughout just the chapters of the

630
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:53,579
book of Revelation, you look at chapters 2 and 3, he's dealing with the seven churches

631
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,099
in Asia.

632
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,099
And then guess what?

633
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,539
In chapter number 4, John's caught up, right?

634
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,659
The Bible tells us in Revelation 4 and verse number 1, after this

635
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,199
I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard

636
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,819
was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will

637
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:16,739
show thee things which must be hereafter." I believe that's the rapture right there.

638
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:22,639
The rapture of the church. The church age, chapters 2 and 3, all of the

639
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:28,019
churches are being addressed. Those seven literal churches that existed that also

640
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:34,059
represent the church age as a whole. We find that then John, he hears

641
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:38,579
that voice as a trumpet talking. Notice what it says, that a door was opened in

642
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:45,259
heaven. Come up hither. And so we understand the purpose of the

643
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:49,299
tribulation and we understand that God now once again is going to deal

644
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:55,399
specifically with Israel. It's the time, it's a time of Jacob's trouble and as he

645
00:40:55,399 --> 00:41:00,139
deals with Israel specifically during those seven years of tribulation there's

646
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:03,299
going to be, as you continue to read through the book of Revelation, you see

647
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:06,899
the sealed judgments and you see the the trumpet judgments and you see the

648
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:11,179
vile judgments and all these judgments that take place and it is a time in

649
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:17,819
which God's wrath is poured out upon mankind. And he's helping Israel to

650
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:24,099
understand that he indeed is the Messiah. And so what's the focus, what's the

651
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:29,059
purpose of the tribulation? It's Israel. It's Israel. And so as we begin to

652
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:33,539
understand Colossians 3 and kind of come full circle to what Paul is saying

653
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:40,179
to these believers, he says, when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall

654
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:45,899
ye also appear with him in glory. So we find that here in this verse of

655
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:50,559
Scripture that he would be speaking about the second coming of Christ, the

656
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,419
second advent, that event that's dealt with in Revelation 19. Remember in

657
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:59,099
Revelation 4 he said that he saw the door in heaven open and in Revelation

658
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,899
19 and 11 it says and I saw heaven opened. Heaven opened so that the church

659
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:08,059
could ascend and then heaven opened because they're coming back. Amen?

660
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:13,739
Revelation 4 and 1 and Revelation 19 and 11. And in between those two events is the

661
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:20,099
tribulation. The tribulation. We find that as we look at the Word of God and he says

662
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:26,179
that he shall appear and then we and ye shall, excuse me, then shall ye also

663
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:31,299
appear with him in glory. The fact of the matter is that, listen, when you look at

664
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,619
the timeline and the distinction it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Some

665
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,659
people teach that there's a pre-tribulation rapture, some a mid-trib

666
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,379
and a post-trib, and you look at those various schools of thought and many

667
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:45,419
times you'll find that there's a misunderstanding of Israel in the church.

668
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:48,739
I'm not trying to be unkind or mean but I'm just simply saying that that's

669
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:53,619
really what the root problem is and you find that it'd be kind of interesting

670
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:57,339
those that would teach a post-trib, how are we going to appear with him if we're

671
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:00,619
it just it doesn't line up and so when you look at all of the scripture and you

672
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,859
interpret all of the scripture the way in which it's to be interpreted, what God

673
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,179
said, not trying to spiritualize anything, not trying to change anything, but here's

674
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,859
what God has said. And when we look at this promise, I want you to just consider

675
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:20,139
in closing this morning, the motivation of this promise. It's not really a point,

676
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,339
I only had two points this morning, but I want you to think about these believers

677
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:28,899
in Colossae and I want you to think about you this morning and as I think

678
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:39,259
about my own life, we say when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye

679
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:45,779
also appear with him in glory. You think about the comfort of this truth, you

680
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:49,739
think about the motivation of this truth. Listen, I'm not just living life for

681
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:55,779
whatever we can gain here. We have this sure promise that gives us confidence,

682
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:00,579
that gives us certainty, that this life is not all that there is. Listen, there

683
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:04,379
are people today that live and they walk upon this earth and they think, oh man

684
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:07,619
this is all there is to life, just live life to the fullest and whatever. I mean

685
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:11,459
the one who has the most toys wins and all that sort of thing, but the reality

686
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:18,579
is that, listen, my focus is way beyond that. Way beyond that. Because I'm

687
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:23,179
gonna come back with Christ. And if you're saved this morning, you're gonna

688
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:30,859
come back with Christ and you're going to rule with him. Isn't that amazing? Wow. If

689
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:35,339
you're not saved this morning, you say preacher, I have no idea what you're

690
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,979
talking about. I've never been saved, I've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

691
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:44,939
as my Savior. If I were to die today, I have no idea what would happen. Could I

692
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:49,539
encourage you this morning to trust Christ? Paul said it this way, today is

693
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:54,619
the day of salvation. Listen, no man knoweth what a day would bring forth.

694
00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:01,379
Boast not thyself of tomorrow is what Proverbs says. We find this morning that

695
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:05,299
if you're not saved, that event, the rapture, is gonna take place and you'll

696
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:11,979
be left behind. If you've heard the gospel, if you're here this morning, you're

697
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:16,179
watching live stream, you've heard the gospel. God says that you'll believe a

698
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:24,379
lie. You'll believe a lie. The Bible tells us that after that Millennial reign of

699
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:28,739
Christ, there's this event called the Great White Throne Judgment. The Bible

700
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:33,139
tells us that the dead, small and great, are gonna stand before God. They're gonna

701
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:40,459
be judged. The Bible says that if you've not been born again, that you'll be cast

702
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:46,379
in a lake of fire. This is the second death. Prior to that truth in Revelation

703
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:49,739
20, for those that would be ruling and reigning with Christ during his

704
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,659
Millennial Kingdom, the Bible says that the second death has no power on us

705
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:58,779
because we've been born again. Could I encourage you this morning to let

706
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:01,659
someone take a Bible and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's

707
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:06,099
your home? Oh, I would beg of you not to leave here without knowing for

708
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:14,179
sure that heaven is your home. 24 years ago, I guess it was, when I understood

709
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:19,379
that I was a sinner in need of a Savior and that Jesus Christ was the only

710
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:24,819
Savior. I understood that he died for me and he paid for me what I could not pay on my

711
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:28,619
own. And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary

712
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,099
and he gave me life. He gave me abundant life. He gave me eternal life. And my

713
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:42,019
desire, even as Paul says, my desire is that he, Christ, would be my life. I'll be

714
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,459
honest with you this morning, I don't know that I can stand here with as much

715
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:49,899
assurance as Paul did and say he is my life. But I want him to be. I want him to

716
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:54,699
have preeminence in my life. And I hope that you do as well. And then as we

717
00:46:54,699 --> 00:47:01,659
consider this promise. Listen, he's going to appear. Don't get bogged down with

718
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:05,779
what's going on in our world. Just know that we're on the winning side.

719
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,899
Curtis Hudson used to sing the song all the time. We're on the winning side. I've

720
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:15,299
read the back of the book and we win. Amen. We're on the winning side. This

721
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:21,899
distinct perspective and then we find this this promise when Christ shall

722
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:27,219
appear. Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

723
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,379
your word and the truth contained therein. We pray God that you would help

724
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:34,819
us to honor you and glorify you through all that we say and all that we do. I

725
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:39,659
thank you God for your word and for the truth contained therein. If there's one

726
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,499
that's not sure of heaven, oh God would you please help them today to understand

727
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:50,059
their need for Christ. For those that have been born again, would you help us

728
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:55,859
God to understand the truth and the teaching of your word with regard to

729
00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:03,579
prophecy, eschatology. Help us Lord to keep our focus on those truths and not

730
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:07,899
to get discouraged or bogged down in this world. Would you bless our time of

731
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:11,459
invitation that decisions would be made that would please thee. Well thank you

732
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:14,579
for what you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me

733
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:19,259
heads are bowed, eyes are closed. I'm gonna have a moment of invitation when we give

734
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:23,259
you an opportunity to respond to the Word of God. Perhaps this morning you're

735
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:26,259
not sure of heaven and you'd like to have someone take a Bible and show you

736
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:29,459
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home. Perhaps this morning you have

737
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:33,139
some other area of your life in which the Lord has spoken to your heart and

738
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:36,899
you want to come to this old-fashioned altar and you want to pray and ask God

739
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:43,019
to help you. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
