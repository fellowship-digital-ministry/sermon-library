00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.039
and certainly appreciate it and trust it's been a blessing to you. In our last

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.119
message we entered into the third chapter of the book of Colossians and

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.000
as we did we mentioned that the book would turn and be a little more

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.440
practical in nature if you will and so thankful that God's Word is practical

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.719
amen it's to be applied in our lives were to be doers of the word and not

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.959
hearers only. We find that as we entered into this third chapter of the book of

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:33.959
Colossians that we were immediately faced with these three verses that

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:40.040
encourage us to be mindful of our position in Christ and I'm so thankful

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.700
for the salvation of these believers in Colossi that Paul is writing to and I'm

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.720
thankful this morning to know that heaven is my home and that I have been

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.639
adopted in the family of God that I understood that I was a sinner in need

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.799
of a Savior and that Jesus Christ is the only Savior he said there is he

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.440
said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.480
I'm thankful that I can understand as the Word of God teaches us that we are

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.959
secure in Christ our position is so vital and we understand that the

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.599
believers in Colossi were encouraged to be mindful of their position and then

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.000
they were encouraged to be mindful of their pursuits and when I understand my

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.680
position it has an impact and influence on what I pursue we find that in our

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.839
lives today in our world in our society that people are pursuing all sorts of

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:40.639
things and we find that as the people of God we are to be pursuing Christ and

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:45.760
we're to be pursuing godliness we're to hunger and thirst after righteousness

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.239
and what a blessing to be mindful of these two wonderful truths that we find

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:56.440
here in Colossians 3 verses 1 through 3 we understand that this epistle was

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.319
initially delivered to the believers in Colossi approximately nineteen hundred

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.279
and sixty years ago that's a long time ago and it was delivered to these

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:11.199
believers nineteen hundred and sixty years ago but the truths that are

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:17.880
contained therein are still applicable and relevant for us today in fact I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.039
bring up specifically the time frame of the writing of the book of Colossians

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.919
because as we approach a verse number four which will be our text for this

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.520
morning we find that this truth that was being referenced the event that was

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.080
being referenced and given to these believers in Colossi has not yet taken

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.600
place though we have full confidence that it will take place we find that as

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.800
we look at the Word of God and we study the Bible we would come away with the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.360
understanding that the Bible is a gift from God I'm so thankful for the Bible

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.559
I'm thankful that God has given us His Word and as I consider the Word of God

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.559
and there are many things that we could say this morning about the Word of God

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:07.360
but we'd understand that God's Word is precious it's precious it's more

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.600
valuable than gold or silver or rubies or precious stones is more valuable than

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.520
any of those things for the Word of God is eternal and it's a precious book and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.839
we ought to view it and understand it as being precious we understand that

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:27.080
this book that we hold not only is it precious but it's powerful it's powerful

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.000
listen the Word of God had the power to change your life and to change my life

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.399
and I'm thankful that God says that His Word is alive it's quick and it's

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:39.199
powerful and it's sharper than a two-edged sword I'm thankful for the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.839
power of the Word of God and when we understand the the power of God's Word

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.119
it helps us understand why the admonition throughout the New Testament

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:53.720
is to preach the Word why because the Word of God is powerful we find that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.839
this book that we hold in our hands it's preserved I'm thankful that God Almighty

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:04.360
who is eternal that He has given the promise to preserve His Word His Word is

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.919
forever settled in heaven and He said that He's given us His Word and that

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.440
He'll preserve it from this generation forever and I'm so thankful that we have

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.679
a preserved Word of God that we can have the confidence when we go to the

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:24.839
Word of God to know that this indeed is the Word of God it's profitable it's

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:29.600
profitable hasn't God's Word helped you in your life the Bible says that of

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.480
itself that it's a lamp unto our feet that it guides us and it leads us we

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.640
understand that Paul as he's writing to Timothy he says that all Scripture is

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:43.079
given by inspiration of God and he says that it's profitable and he lists

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.000
several things that it's profitable for and we understand this morning that God's

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.640
Word is profitable but I also understand this morning that God's Word is

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.519
prophetical the prophecy of God's Word we find that as you study the the whole

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:03.519
of God's Word and we understand that as we look at the truth of God's Word that

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:09.519
God is eternal is no beginning and no end he created time he's outside of time

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:16.320
and yet he has provided us a book that records for us all of the history of

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.839
mankind that he wants us to have and as we look at this verse of Scripture in

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.320
Colossians 3 and verse number 4 and we will unwrap the eschatological truth of

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.959
this verse but there's a parenthetical statement that deserves our attention

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:39.359
notice with me in Colossians 3 and verse number 4 the Bible says this when Christ

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:51.119
who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory if you

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.920
have your bulletin today you've already seen that the title for the message is

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.720
when Christ shall appear we know that he came the first time and we're awaiting

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.959
his second return we find that as we look at the Word of God and we

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:09.320
understand the truth that is contained herein that I mentioned that there's

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.959
this parenthetical statement that deserves our attention if you're taking

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.000
notes I would simply point out this morning number one there is a distinct

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.359
perspective there's a distinct perspective the Apostle Paul is he's

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:25.160
writing to the believers in Colossae not only would he impart truth to these

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.519
believers but we find that just as the cases with many of the epistles that

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:34.320
Paul was used as the human penman to author that he would also share with the

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.160
believers that he would write to his own perspective and he would share many

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.760
things about his own life we find that this man Paul he was converted on the

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.839
road to Damascus and God changed his life and God called him and God placed a

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:55.000
specific calling upon the life of Paul and we find as we read throughout the

00:06:55.359 --> 00:07:00.480
Word of God that you would find that God gives us the record of many of the

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.519
accomplishments if you will of the Apostle Paul and how God used Paul for

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:09.920
his honor and for his glory and what a blessing to read about and study the

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.040
life of Paul then you understand that Paul himself had the perspective that he

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.399
was the chief of sinners you understand that Paul understood that that in his

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.200
flesh dwelleth no good thing the Apostle Paul understood that he was what he was

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.320
by the grace of God but as he shares his perspective and I believe it's a

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.600
distinct perspective here in our text of Scripture this parenthetical statement

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.640
notice what he says in verse number four when Christ notice the phrase who is our

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:50.600
life Wow I mean that's a simple yet impactful statement in fact I believe

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.279
this morning that if you're not careful as you read the Word of God that you

00:07:54.279 --> 00:08:00.000
could quickly pass over such a statement no doubt when we read the Bible there

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.279
are times in which we'll have various things going on and distractions would

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:09.239
persist and we would find that perhaps we miss something here and there or

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:13.000
maybe we have the busyness of our day in our schedule when we read a little too

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.600
quickly if you will and we can miss simple statements in the Word of God but

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.559
how impactful this statement is when Christ who is our life I believe that

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.720
this statement here in verse number four ought to stop each and every one of us

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:38.479
in our tracks and cause us to evaluate can I say as Paul said that Christ is my

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:45.400
life can you say as Paul said could the believers in Colossae say as Paul said

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:56.559
he Christ is our life the reality is that he is the one who gives life it is

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.880
only by God's grace that you're living at this very moment but we also

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.719
understand that is only through God that he gives eternal life the Bible says in

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:10.679
Romans chapter number six that the gift of God is eternal life aren't you

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:15.200
thankful for the gift of God it's through Jesus Christ our Lord because he

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.159
went to that cross of Calvary we sang about the cross this morning and how he

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:23.440
went to that old rugged cross and he bled and he died to pay for the sin of

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.840
mankind to pay for your sin and my sin the reality is that we're all sinners

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.679
and sin requires a payment and as I shared with someone just recently

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:37.280
there's only one payment that's acceptable for the sin of mankind and

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.239
that is the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you can't work your way to

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.520
heaven you can't give enough to get to heaven there's nothing you can do in of

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.520
yourself to get to heaven it's all in what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.200
and he has given us eternal life the reality is that in John chapter number

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.159
10 in verse number 10 the Bible says that he came as the Good Shepherd and he

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:02.159
gives life and he gives life to the world

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:05.479
He gives it more abundantly.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:08.839
What a blessing and what a joy

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:11.599
to have the abundant life.

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:13.599
Some of you remember what life was like

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:15.399
before salvation.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:17.799
You remember what life was like

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:20.019
and the reality is that life now

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.079
as a child of God is so much better,

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:25.239
is so much different than what we had

00:10:25.239 --> 00:10:28.799
prior to being a Christian.

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:31.719
No longer am I living just for the here and now.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:35.279
I get to enjoy the blessings of God here and now,

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.799
but the reality is that I'm heaven bound

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:41.239
and I have this life that He's given me.

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:43.679
And when I understand that He's given life,

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.559
when I understand all of the blessings

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:47.119
that He's bestowed upon us,

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:49.479
and we find that Paul makes this statement

00:10:49.479 --> 00:10:54.479
when Christ, who is our life.

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:56.159
I wonder this morning,

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.439
can we make in honesty before the Lord,

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.619
can we make that statement?

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.619
The reality is that I believe that even still today,

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:06.819
people continue to use this expression

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:09.539
that is used here in this verse of Scripture.

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:12.299
My life is baseball.

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:13.859
Baseball is their life,

00:11:13.859 --> 00:11:15.659
or this thing is their life,

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:17.379
or maybe a parent says of a child,

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:18.299
they're my life,

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:20.219
or a spouse says of their spouse,

00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:21.059
they're my life.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:22.659
We understand the statement.

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:24.619
People use it still to this day.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.759
What does this statement mean?

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:32.039
What is it that we would understand

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:34.119
when someone would say of their child

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:38.479
that's so enthralled with a particular aspect

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:39.839
of maybe it's a sport

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.159
or maybe it's some type of activity,

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.959
and the parent would say,

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:45.639
as they would observe their child,

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:46.679
and maybe there's an onlooker,

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.519
and they would say,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.119
well, you know, that's just their life.

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:51.719
What do they mean by that?

00:11:51.719 --> 00:11:53.959
What does that Paul means by this statement?

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.559
I believe that we would understand it

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:57.799
to be used to designate someone

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:02.799
or something that would have preeminence in our lives.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.919
And can I submit to you this morning

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:08.339
that there's only one person

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.799
that should have the preeminence in your life

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:12.219
and in my life,

00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:14.959
and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.639
When Paul says when Christ,

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.639
who is our life,

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.099
it's the Lord Jesus Christ

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:23.439
that deserves that place of preeminence

00:12:23.439 --> 00:12:25.959
in your life and in my life.

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:28.079
And we find that Paul understood that

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:30.319
because of his conversion.

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:32.919
You understand that Christ was not his life

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.559
in the same sense that we would look at this statement

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:36.879
prior to his conversion,

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.599
just as Christ was not your life

00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:40.799
prior to your conversion.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.759
If you can look back before you were saved

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.519
and you could think of maybe some pursuits

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.759
and some things that you were seeking after,

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:48.159
and someone would say of you,

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.519
this is their life,

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:50.759
this is their pursuit,

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:53.559
this is what is preeminent in their lives.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.919
In fact, there are times in which

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.639
you can speak to people and you know

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.999
that if you get on a certain subject or topic

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:03.199
that you've found the thing that is their life.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.959
Because they just can't stop talking about it.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:09.959
I wonder,

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:11.879
is Christ our life?

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.279
That we get talking about the Lord

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:16.599
and we just kind of can't stop talking about Him.

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:17.839
Because of how good He is

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.159
and all that He's done for us.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:22.839
Remember what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:24.599
and verse 15 holds your place here

00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:26.279
in the book of Colossians, if you will.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:28.079
And I want you to notice what Paul says

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:30.959
here in this passage of Scripture.

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.799
Paul understood what the Lord did for him

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:37.359
and he says this in 2 Corinthians 5,

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.839
and that He died for all.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.879
It's a universal truth that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:44.519
died for the sin of mankind.

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.759
For all.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.759
It says this, that they which live

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:53.359
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:55.999
but unto Him which died for them

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:58.439
and rose again.

00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:00.519
What a great truth.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:04.159
When Christ, who is our life,

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:06.439
notice in Colossians 1 and verse 18,

00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:08.319
and we studied this several months ago

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:09.599
as we studied through the first chapter

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.559
of the book of Colossians,

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:13.199
when Paul gives this great section

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:16.879
with regard to the Person of Jesus Christ

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:19.959
and what magnitude we find in this text

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.359
and how beautiful it is,

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.439
but we find in verse 18 that he says this

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:24.639
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.919
that He is the head of the body of the church,

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:29.119
who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.599
that in how many things?

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:33.039
All things.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.519
He might have the preeminence.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.239
Listen, I don't expect Christ to have

00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:41.159
the preeminence in the life of an unbeliever.

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:42.559
Do you?

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.919
No, they're lost.

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:47.399
In the life of a child of God?

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:48.879
Someone that's been born again?

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.559
Remember, Paul's writing to the saints

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.079
and faithful brethren in Christ

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:54.159
which are at Colossae according to v. 2

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.319
of chapter 1,

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:57.599
and as I understand my position in Christ

00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:59.599
and I understand what He's done for me,

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.479
and I understand that in all things,

00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:03.679
not in some things, not in most things,

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:05.199
but in all things,

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:09.359
He must have the preeminence.

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:11.479
And Paul says when Christ,

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:14.479
who is our life,

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:18.959
that's a simple yet impactful statement.

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:22.039
I'm going to read to you the words of a song.

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:23.799
Mr. Thompson, Mr. Will Thompson

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.279
penned the words to this song.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.039
It's number 100 in our song book.

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.239
The title of the song is

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:34.359
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:36.599
Listen to what Mr. Thompson said.

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:38.919
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:43.119
My life, my joy, my all.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:46.079
He is my strength from day to day.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:49.479
Without Him, I would fall.

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:53.039
When I am sad, to Him I go.

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:56.559
No other one can cheer me so.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:00.359
When I am sad, He makes me glad.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.479
He is my friend.

00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:05.119
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:08.079
My friend in trials sore.

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:10.599
I go to Him for blessings

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:14.879
and He gives them o'er and o'er.

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:17.799
He sends the sunshine and the rain.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:20.879
He sends the harvest, golden grain.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:24.119
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain.

00:16:24.119 --> 00:16:26.199
He is my friend.

00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:29.319
Jesus is all the world to me

00:16:29.319 --> 00:16:32.879
and true to Him I'll be.

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:35.999
Oh, how could I this friend deny

00:16:35.999 --> 00:16:38.959
when He's so true to me.

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.159
Following Him, I know I'm right.

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:43.719
He watches o'er me day and night.

00:16:43.719 --> 00:16:46.439
Following Him by day and night,

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:48.239
He's my friend.

00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:50.039
The final verse of this wonderful hymn,

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:52.159
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:53.439
I want no better friend.

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:54.959
I trust Him now.

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:58.639
I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.439
Beautiful life with such a friend.

00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:03.119
Beautiful life that has no end.

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:06.359
Eternal life, eternal joy.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.959
He's my friend.

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:13.079
Mr. Thompson started this hymn by saying,

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.839
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.079
My life, my joy, my all.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.839
This man was saved by the blood of Christ.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.039
And he understood that Christ,

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:27.239
who is my life,

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:28.279
He's my all in all.

00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:30.199
He's everything to me.

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:31.799
Without Him, as the songwriter said,

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:32.879
I will fail.

00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:34.519
I will fall.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:35.959
Remember, it was the Lord Jesus Christ

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:37.759
in John 10, I referenced a moment ago

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.639
when He said that I give them life

00:17:39.639 --> 00:17:42.079
that they might have it more abundantly,

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:44.199
that He says just a few verses after that,

00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:49.319
that without Me, ye can do nothing.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.239
I'm so thankful this morning

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:52.919
for this distinct perspective

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:54.279
that is shared with us

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:56.239
in Colossians 3 and verse 4.

00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:58.079
It's a parenthetical statement,

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:00.719
but oh, how impactful it is.

00:18:00.719 --> 00:18:04.119
This morning, can we, as Paul said,

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:05.359
and as he sought to encourage

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:06.799
these believers in Colossae,

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:10.959
can we say that Christ is our life?

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:12.639
Notice as we continue to go

00:18:12.639 --> 00:18:15.159
through this fourth verse of Colossians 3,

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:17.159
not only is there a distinct perspective,

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:20.279
but there is a declared promise.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:21.999
I'm thankful for the promises of God's Word.

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:24.759
In fact, we sing about standing on the promises.

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:26.919
It's Peter that says that He's given us

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:30.399
exceeding great and precious promises.

00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:32.879
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's Word.

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:34.079
I mentioned to you earlier

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.079
by way of introduction

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:36.399
that this book of Colossians

00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:39.199
was written nearly 1,960 years ago,

00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:40.799
and yet the promise that was given

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.519
to these believers in Colossae

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:44.079
that many years ago

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:47.479
still stands true to this very day.

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.479
The event has not yet taken place,

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:52.079
but we have full confidence

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:54.279
that in what God has said He will do,

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:56.159
that He indeed will do.

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:58.319
He will bring it to pass.

00:18:58.319 --> 00:18:59.679
Remember that Jesus said

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.879
to His troubled disciples

00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:04.079
when they were nearing the time

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:05.679
of Christ going to Calvary

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:08.519
and Jesus had given them much instruction

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:09.919
with regard to those events

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:14.119
that would unfold in the days ahead.

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.440
He says to them in John 14,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.759
let not your heart be troubled.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.919
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.799
In My Father's house are many mansions.

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:23.719
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:26.039
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.599
And then He makes this statement

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:28.399
in v. 3,

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:30.279
and if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:33.399
I will come again and receive you unto Myself

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:36.919
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:39.000
There were scoffers during the first century.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.279
Peter deals with them.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.319
There are scoffers that continue today

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:44.839
that say where is the promise of His return?

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:47.679
But as Peter would say to those scoffers

00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:50.039
as he would respond to their attacks,

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:50.959
he would say this,

00:19:50.959 --> 00:19:55.199
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:57.239
but is longsuffering to us, Lord,

00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:59.000
not willing that any should perish,

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:01.039
but that all should come to repentance.

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:02.639
I'm thankful that we serve a...

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:06.959
who cannot lie. I'm thankful this morning that we serve a God who is not slack

00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:11.039
concerning his promise, aren't you? I mean he's never failed and he's not planning

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:16.559
to. We serve the God of the universe and as we look at this declared promise, we

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:23.239
find that the Apostle Paul says this, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear.

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:30.239
I like that word shall. It's certain. He doesn't say when Christ might appear or

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:36.879
we think he is going to, he could appear. No, no, he shall appear. He's coming. He

00:20:36.879 --> 00:20:44.159
says this, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. You know the study of

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:50.759
eschatology is fascinating. The study of end times. We find that our God, as I

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:56.159
mentioned earlier, he is eternal so he is able to provide us with a timeline that

00:20:56.159 --> 00:21:02.399
stretches from creation to eternity. In fact, as you study the Word of God, he

00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:07.599
gives us insight even to events prior to creation for the Bible tells us that

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:13.359
Jesus was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world. And we find

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:17.439
that our God is outside of time. It's sometimes hard for us to understand

00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:22.639
because we are contained within time and everything is time, time, time,

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:29.639
time. We're just so controlled by time. But God is outside of time and he's

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:34.199
given us this great truth here and we find that as we study eschatology that

00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:38.559
we have the opportunity to study the prophecy that God's given as we begin to

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:42.639
think about specifically eschatology with dealing with the prophecy of end

00:21:42.639 --> 00:21:47.279
times or future events that we'd find that the Word of God gives us much

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:52.759
truth. Here, as we examine this verse of Scripture, I believe that you would

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:57.719
conclude that the event of prophecy that's being addressed here is the

00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:02.679
second coming of Christ and not the rapture of the church. We understand that

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:06.479
oftentimes we speak about the second coming of Christ and we can use the word

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:10.719
kind of interchangeably or the phrase interchangeably to talk about two

00:22:10.719 --> 00:22:15.279
distinct events on the prophetic calendar. We find that there is a

00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:20.399
prophecy, an event on the prophetical calendar of the rapture of the church.

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:24.719
But then we also find that there's an event on the prophetical calendar in

00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:29.679
God's Word that deals with his second coming, the second advent, if you will. We

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:33.199
understand that he came the first time just as he said. When the fullness of

00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:37.559
time was come, God sent forth his Son and he's gonna come the second time right

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:42.559
on time. He's not gonna be a moment late. He's coming just as he is supposed to

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:47.479
and we find that this event that's mentioned here in Colossians 3 and verse

00:22:47.479 --> 00:22:53.639
number 4 really is dealing with the truth of Revelation 19 and not with

00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:59.719
1st Thessalonians 4. Now I hope over the next few moments that I can unpack and

00:22:59.719 --> 00:23:04.119
help understand something in about 20 minutes that could take hours of

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:10.559
discussion. So I hope that someone told me I talk fast. I try to slow it down a

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:14.679
little bit, but sometimes I got to talk fast because we got a lot to cover. And

00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:19.559
so I'll talk fast if you listen fast. I'm just I'm not gonna go any faster than I

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:22.479
was. But listen, when we look at Colossians 3 and verse number 4, notice

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:28.919
the word when the Bible says this, when Christ shall, notice this word appear. When

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:35.959
Christ shall appear. The Bible is very specific. Every word of God is given to

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:39.999
us and we're thankful for every word of God. They're pure words. And here Paul

00:23:39.999 --> 00:23:44.319
says when Christ shall appear. The word appear means to make actual and visible.

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:50.879
It means this, to become manifest. Now it also says this, that when Christ who is

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:58.679
our life shall appear, notice, then shall ye also appear with Christ in God. Now

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:05.319
specifically who is Paul speaking to? The ye are the believers in Colossae. We find

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:09.559
that by extension when we understand the prophecy and the promise that is given

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:14.479
here, that ye also includes me. It includes you, the believers, the people

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:18.639
that have been saved by the blood of the Lamb. If you're here this morning and you

00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:23.279
have a 100% confidence that heaven is your home, not because of anything that

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:27.119
you've done, but because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, then

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:35.239
ye means you. Because when Christ shall appear, it says this, then shall ye also

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:40.519
appear with him in glory. Yes, specifically he's speaking to believers

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:44.639
in Colossae, but they're saved the same way we're saved. And when we become part

00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:50.079
of the Bride of Christ, we can join in on the promise that is given. Now

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:53.959
understand with me that as we look at this word appear and understand

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:58.279
that it says that we also shall appear with him in glory, we could ask this

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:04.439
question, when does this happen? When is it that this happens? You'd understand

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:08.239
that this is not speaking of the rapture, for that event happened

00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:14.679
suddenly, and believers are caught up to meet the Lord in the air. In fact, as we

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:20.319
look at the truth of the rapture of the church, the Apostle Paul, as he's

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:24.279
speaking to the believers in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 52,

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:30.479
describes that event of the rapture of the church in this manner, in a moment, in

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:37.919
the twinkling of an eye. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And we find that

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:43.079
he's discussing in 1 Corinthians 15 the rapture of the church when we are going

00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:47.359
to be caught up and to meet the Lord in the air. 1 Thessalonians chapter 4

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:52.919
deals with it in great detail. We find that as we look at that truth in

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:57.439
1 Thessalonians 4 and verse number 13 through 18, and he gives the truth with

00:25:57.439 --> 00:26:02.879
regard to the rapture of the church, Paul then describes it this way in

00:26:02.879 --> 00:26:07.559
chapter 5 and verse number 2, that the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:13.039
the night. And so we find here that as we would understand the truth of the

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:16.479
rapture, and we'd understand the terminology that is given that in a

00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:21.119
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, as a thief in the night, that that's the

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:25.559
rapture. Listen, it's going to happen so quickly. As Brother Sommerdorf mentioned

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:29.159
last Sunday morning as he spoke about the rapture of the church, no one's

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:33.119
going to be able to say, oh man, he's coming and let's do this, that, or the

00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:38.839
other thing. No, it's gonna happen just like that. Actually faster than that. And

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:47.199
we're gonna be gone. What a joy. Looking for the upper taker, not the undertaker.

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:51.399
Amen? That's what Brother Mershon always says. And the reality is that we

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:55.879
understand that Jesus is coming again, but oftentimes we speak out on coming

00:26:55.879 --> 00:26:58.919
again, we're focused upon the rapture of the church. And that's okay, that's the

00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:02.799
next event on the prophetic calendar. Jesus is coming again. We're gonna be

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:08.119
raptured out of here. But he's not going to make himself manifest, he's not gonna

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:13.119
make himself actual or visible in that particular coming, because he's gonna go

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:15.799
in the air. We're gonna meet him in the air, it's just gonna be like that, just

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:20.759
that quickly, and we're gonna meet him in the air. And so here is Paul speaks to

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:25.639
the believers in Colossians, he says, when Christ, who is our life, shall appear,

00:27:25.639 --> 00:27:30.559
then shall ye also appear with him in glory. So again, when does this event

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:35.959
happen? We find that at the second coming of Christ, when he comes and comes all

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:40.239
the way to earth, that what happens, the Bible reveals to us in Revelation 19,

00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:47.439
we'll look at it in just a moment, that we come with him. We come with him. Not

00:27:47.439 --> 00:27:51.199
only do we come with him, but the host of the heavenly angels come. I mean, it's

00:27:51.199 --> 00:27:59.679
gonna be a serious situation. Amen? Listen, he came the first time as a babe, and he

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:05.039
came the first time to die for the sins of mankind. But when he comes again, he's

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:12.159
coming to rule and to reign. The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And he's not coming

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:17.159
as a babe in the manger, he's coming as the conquering King of kings and

00:28:17.159 --> 00:28:24.119
Lord of lords. And we find that as we look at Revelation 19, that as that event

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:29.479
is given to us in detail, that not only will we return with him, but then

00:28:29.479 --> 00:28:34.959
the battle of Armageddon ensues, and then we find that the millennial, the literal

00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:39.519
millennial reign of Christ begins. He will rule and reign for a thousand years

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:44.759
upon the earth. And by the way, we'll rule with him. Isn't that awesome? Look at

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:50.559
Revelation 19 with me, if you will. Now remember, this is the context in which

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:56.639
Paul is sharing with these believers with regard to the when Christ shall

00:28:56.639 --> 00:29:04.199
appear. Then shall ye also appear with him in glory. And find in Revelation 19,

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:12.079
beginning in verse number 11. Revelation 19, beginning in verse number 11, the

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:17.199
Bible says, and I saw heaven opened. Behold, a white horse and he that sat

00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:23.039
upon him was called Faithful and True. Oh, we could speak for a long time just upon

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:29.359
those two names that are ascribed to our Savior. He's faithful. Aren't you thankful

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:33.599
for the faithfulness of God? He's dependable. He's trustworthy. Listen,

00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:38.999
remember this promise that's given to the church in Colossae 1960 years ago.

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:42.719
Why is it that we still have confidence and certainty in this promise? Because

00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:48.359
he's faithful. He's outside of time. We can sit around and say, where is the

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:52.599
promise of his return? I mean, he said he was gonna come. And in that same passage

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:56.279
of Scripture in 2nd Peter 3, the Bible tells us that a day is as a thousand

00:29:56.279 --> 00:30:04.639
years as a day. To God, why? Because he's outside of time. Notice, he's faithful.

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:11.599
he's faithful, he's true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

00:30:11.599 --> 00:30:17.099
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written

00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:22.719
that no man knew but he himself, and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and

00:30:22.719 --> 00:30:26.559
his name is called the Word of God."

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:30.439
Remember the truth of John 1, in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word

00:30:30.439 --> 00:30:31.839
was God.

00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:37.159
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us in verse number 14, and here his name is the

00:30:37.159 --> 00:30:38.159
Word of God.

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:44.319
Notice verse 14, and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,

00:30:44.319 --> 00:30:48.039
clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:49.279
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:53.919
Listen, it's not those filthy rags, it's not my own righteousness, I'm clothed in the righteousness

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:55.839
of God Almighty.

00:30:55.839 --> 00:31:00.839
Because the Bible tells us that he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:06.639
we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:11.159
Verse 15, and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, and with it he should smite the nations,

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:14.779
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:20.519
and wrath of Almighty God, and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:27.079
King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:29.359
Wow.

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:38.199
And he shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:43.319
These two events that we often refer to and sometimes use interchangeably with regard

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:48.439
to the return of Christ or the second coming of Christ, when we begin to understand the

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:53.639
truth of prophecy and we'd study eschatology and the Word of God, and we begin to understand

00:31:53.639 --> 00:31:57.639
that these two events are separated by seven years.

00:31:57.639 --> 00:32:00.519
We understand Daniel's prophecy in Daniel chapter number nine.

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:04.919
I don't have time to unfold all of this, but I hope to whet your appetite enough that you'd

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:09.959
go back and read and study, and I could give you the truth in a summary format this morning

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:14.799
that will help us to understand what God desires for us to understand.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:17.199
I know there's some people that say, I want to know when he's coming.

00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:18.519
You're not going to know.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:22.199
You can study the Bible and come up with all the numerology you want to come up with and

00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:23.199
come up with it.

00:32:23.199 --> 00:32:25.959
God says, no man knoweth the hour.

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:30.839
Jesus said, in fact, to his disciples before he ascended to heaven, when they asked him

00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:36.359
in Acts chapter number one, now at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel, and he

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:41.079
said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his

00:32:41.079 --> 00:32:46.479
own power, but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall

00:32:46.479 --> 00:32:50.799
be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:51.799
part of the earth.

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:52.799
What are we saying?

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:57.359
You have a job, and your job is not to worry about the date on the calendar that I'm coming

00:32:57.359 --> 00:32:58.359
back.

00:32:58.359 --> 00:33:04.399
You just know that I am coming back, and here's your job, here's your duty, your responsibility

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:07.999
until I should return.

00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:12.039
And so we begin to study prophecy and we begin to understand what's taking place.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:18.679
We look at these two events prophetically, the return of Christ, looking at the rapture

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:24.359
of the church and his second advent, his second coming, we find that there's a separation

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:25.639
of seven years.

00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:31.199
I believe this morning that in order for us to properly understand prophecy, it is absolutely

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:36.559
essential that we properly understand Israel and the church.

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:43.879
There is a grave mistake in which people do not properly understand the distinction between

00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:47.019
Israel and the church.

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:52.099
I read with me clearly this morning that the church is not Israel.

00:33:52.099 --> 00:33:53.699
We're not Israel.

00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:56.539
We're not spiritual Israel.

00:33:56.539 --> 00:33:58.219
Israel is Israel.

00:33:58.219 --> 00:34:02.899
And by the way, if you read in Romans chapter number 11, and we don't have time to develop

00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:08.019
all of that either, but if you read in Romans chapter number 11, he's talking about Israel

00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:09.419
in verse number 25.

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:14.899
He says, for I would not, brethren, that ye shall be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye

00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:17.579
should be wise in your own conceits.

00:34:17.579 --> 00:34:23.059
Notice what he says, that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:24.339
the Gentiles become in.

00:34:24.339 --> 00:34:30.059
He just talked to them about the way in which the Gentiles were graft in and all that was

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:31.059
taking place.

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:32.059
Why?

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:34.899
Because Israel rejected Messiah.

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:37.819
And that wasn't a surprise to God, by the way.

00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:39.419
He knows everything.

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:45.179
And Israel rejected Christ as being Messiah, and therefore the Gentiles were graft in.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:51.179
The mystery of the church is that the church is distinct from Israel, and it's made up

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:57.659
of Jew and Gentile together that are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:34:57.659 --> 00:35:00.779
We're a completely separate entity.

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:05.899
Notice also in Romans chapter number 11, in verse number 29, the Bible says, for the gifts

00:35:05.899 --> 00:35:09.579
and calling of God are without repentance.

00:35:09.579 --> 00:35:11.019
You know what he's speaking about?

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:15.619
He's speaking about all of those promises that he gave to Israel in the Old Testament.

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:21.939
The promises to Abraham and to the Jewish people and saying of those promises that the

00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:24.339
gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:29.339
In other words, just because they turned on God doesn't mean that God's not going to fulfill

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:30.939
what he's promised them.

00:35:30.939 --> 00:35:33.899
Do you remember the Abrahamic covenant?

00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:40.259
Abraham was sound asleep when God passed through, signifying that the Lord passed through

00:35:40.259 --> 00:35:46.299
twice and signifying that these promises were not conditional.

00:35:46.299 --> 00:35:51.859
They were not dependent upon Israel or Abraham, certainly responding in a certain way, but

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:54.979
they were dependent upon God.

00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:59.819
We understand in the Word of God that there are some conditional promises.

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:03.339
Oftentimes conditional promises in the Word of God look like this.

00:36:03.339 --> 00:36:08.939
If then, if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray

00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:13.419
and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and heal

00:36:13.419 --> 00:36:14.419
their land.

00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.579
That's what the second Chronicle 7 in verse number 14.

00:36:16.579 --> 00:36:19.619
Proverbs chapter number 2, you look through the passage of Scripture, there's a whole

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:24.299
host in just the first 10 verses of if then promises.

00:36:24.299 --> 00:36:30.499
We find that there are if then promises, but then there are unconditional promises.

00:36:30.499 --> 00:36:35.259
God says here of Israel that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, and

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.939
so Israel is distinct from the church.

00:36:37.939 --> 00:36:42.819
When we understand that truth, it helps us to understand prophecy.

00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:48.139
When we blur that truth and we try to make the church spiritual Israel and we try to

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:52.859
do all of these things and spiritualize the text, then we get all kinds of sideways and

00:36:52.859 --> 00:36:57.339
messed up on understanding the truth that God has given us in his Word.

00:36:57.339 --> 00:37:02.899
I often have referred to it in this manner, and I don't do a lot of cooking and baking

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:05.659
and that sort of thing, but I often refer to it in this manner.

00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:10.039
If we could use an illustration this morning of one that would be cooking, and perhaps

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:15.899
you're making a dish and you're preparing this elaborate meal, and there's a particular

00:37:15.899 --> 00:37:19.659
sauce that needs to go with that dish, and you have to do some things in the beginning,

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:25.579
but then that sauce is not necessary until the very end of the cooking process.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:29.179
And what you do with that sauce is maybe if we could use this terminology, you put

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:32.779
it on the back burner.

00:37:32.779 --> 00:37:36.659
It's still maybe simmering a little bit, you've got it on super low heat, it's still kind

00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:43.099
of simmering, but it's not forgotten about, it's not discarded, but it's not in focus

00:37:43.099 --> 00:37:46.379
right now because there are other things to tend to.

00:37:46.379 --> 00:37:49.339
And you're preparing that meal and you're dealing with that meal and you're putting

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:53.179
all of the other ingredients together, and then you come to the end and you've got to

00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:57.299
take that sauce and bring it back to the front again.

00:37:57.299 --> 00:38:03.659
If I could use that analogy in explaining to you this way, that in a similar manner,

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:09.939
God, because Israel rejected Messiah, He put them on the back burner.

00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:13.739
It's not that Jews can't be saved today.

00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:15.739
Jewish people can still be saved today.

00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:21.619
Paul, in fact, says, my prayer in God to Israel is that they might be saved in Romans 10 and

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:23.039
verse number 1.

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:25.919
There are Jewish people that can be saved, but they have to be saved the same way that

00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:28.039
you and I are saved.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:31.759
They can't just say, well, I'm Jewish and so therefore I'm okay.

00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:35.119
Doesn't work that way.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:42.199
So for a season, the church age, a period of time that's not defined in years, God has

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:47.899
put Israel on the back burner and He's dealing with the church.

00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:50.619
The church, the bride of Christ.

00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:55.739
And as He deals with the church, we find the church age, we find the epistles and all

00:38:55.739 --> 00:39:00.939
that's given to us as the church, all of our responsibilities as the bride of Christ.

00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:12.019
But then at some point, the bride of Christ is gone and Israel comes back on the burner.

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:19.179
And so what happens when we understand, again, the truth and the distinction between Israel

00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:24.459
and the church, it also assists us, it's important that we would understand why.

00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:27.899
What is the purpose of the tribulation?

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:33.219
The purpose of the tribulation is to deal with Israel again.

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:37.499
In fact, Jeremiah says it this way in Jeremiah 30 and verse number 7, he says that it's the

00:39:37.499 --> 00:39:40.339
time of Jacob's trouble.

00:39:40.339 --> 00:39:42.519
The time of Jacob's trouble.

00:39:42.519 --> 00:39:43.779
So the church is raptured.

00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:48.099
In fact, if you read the book of Revelation, you read throughout just the chapters of the

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:53.579
book of Revelation, you look at chapters 2 and 3, he's dealing with the seven churches

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.099
in Asia.

00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:56.099
And then guess what?

00:39:56.099 --> 00:40:01.539
In chapter number 4, John's caught up, right?

00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:04.659
The Bible tells us in Revelation 4 and verse number 1, after this

00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:08.199
I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:12.819
was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will

00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:16.739
show thee things which must be hereafter." I believe that's the rapture right there.

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:22.639
The rapture of the church. The church age, chapters 2 and 3, all of the

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:28.019
churches are being addressed. Those seven literal churches that existed that also

00:40:28.019 --> 00:40:34.059
represent the church age as a whole. We find that then John, he hears

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:38.579
that voice as a trumpet talking. Notice what it says, that a door was opened in

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:45.259
heaven. Come up hither. And so we understand the purpose of the

00:40:45.259 --> 00:40:49.299
tribulation and we understand that God now once again is going to deal

00:40:49.299 --> 00:40:55.399
specifically with Israel. It's the time, it's a time of Jacob's trouble and as he

00:40:55.399 --> 00:41:00.139
deals with Israel specifically during those seven years of tribulation there's

00:41:00.139 --> 00:41:03.299
going to be, as you continue to read through the book of Revelation, you see

00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:06.899
the sealed judgments and you see the the trumpet judgments and you see the

00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:11.179
vile judgments and all these judgments that take place and it is a time in

00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:17.819
which God's wrath is poured out upon mankind. And he's helping Israel to

00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:24.099
understand that he indeed is the Messiah. And so what's the focus, what's the

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:29.059
purpose of the tribulation? It's Israel. It's Israel. And so as we begin to

00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:33.539
understand Colossians 3 and kind of come full circle to what Paul is saying

00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:40.179
to these believers, he says, when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall

00:41:40.179 --> 00:41:45.899
ye also appear with him in glory. So we find that here in this verse of

00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:50.559
Scripture that he would be speaking about the second coming of Christ, the

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:54.419
second advent, that event that's dealt with in Revelation 19. Remember in

00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:59.099
Revelation 4 he said that he saw the door in heaven open and in Revelation

00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:03.899
19 and 11 it says and I saw heaven opened. Heaven opened so that the church

00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:08.059
could ascend and then heaven opened because they're coming back. Amen?

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:13.739
Revelation 4 and 1 and Revelation 19 and 11. And in between those two events is the

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:20.099
tribulation. The tribulation. We find that as we look at the Word of God and he says

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:26.179
that he shall appear and then we and ye shall, excuse me, then shall ye also

00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:31.299
appear with him in glory. The fact of the matter is that, listen, when you look at

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:34.619
the timeline and the distinction it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Some

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:38.659
people teach that there's a pre-tribulation rapture, some a mid-trib

00:42:38.659 --> 00:42:42.379
and a post-trib, and you look at those various schools of thought and many

00:42:42.379 --> 00:42:45.419
times you'll find that there's a misunderstanding of Israel in the church.

00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:48.739
I'm not trying to be unkind or mean but I'm just simply saying that that's

00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:53.619
really what the root problem is and you find that it'd be kind of interesting

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:57.339
those that would teach a post-trib, how are we going to appear with him if we're

00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:00.619
it just it doesn't line up and so when you look at all of the scripture and you

00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:04.859
interpret all of the scripture the way in which it's to be interpreted, what God

00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:09.179
said, not trying to spiritualize anything, not trying to change anything, but here's

00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:14.859
what God has said. And when we look at this promise, I want you to just consider

00:43:14.859 --> 00:43:20.139
in closing this morning, the motivation of this promise. It's not really a point,

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:23.339
I only had two points this morning, but I want you to think about these believers

00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:28.899
in Colossae and I want you to think about you this morning and as I think

00:43:28.899 --> 00:43:39.259
about my own life, we say when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye

00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:45.779
also appear with him in glory. You think about the comfort of this truth, you

00:43:45.779 --> 00:43:49.739
think about the motivation of this truth. Listen, I'm not just living life for

00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:55.779
whatever we can gain here. We have this sure promise that gives us confidence,

00:43:55.779 --> 00:44:00.579
that gives us certainty, that this life is not all that there is. Listen, there

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:04.379
are people today that live and they walk upon this earth and they think, oh man

00:44:04.379 --> 00:44:07.619
this is all there is to life, just live life to the fullest and whatever. I mean

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:11.459
the one who has the most toys wins and all that sort of thing, but the reality

00:44:11.459 --> 00:44:18.579
is that, listen, my focus is way beyond that. Way beyond that. Because I'm

00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:23.179
gonna come back with Christ. And if you're saved this morning, you're gonna

00:44:23.179 --> 00:44:30.859
come back with Christ and you're going to rule with him. Isn't that amazing? Wow. If

00:44:30.859 --> 00:44:35.339
you're not saved this morning, you say preacher, I have no idea what you're

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:39.979
talking about. I've never been saved, I've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:44:39.979 --> 00:44:44.939
as my Savior. If I were to die today, I have no idea what would happen. Could I

00:44:44.939 --> 00:44:49.539
encourage you this morning to trust Christ? Paul said it this way, today is

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:54.619
the day of salvation. Listen, no man knoweth what a day would bring forth.

00:44:54.619 --> 00:45:01.379
Boast not thyself of tomorrow is what Proverbs says. We find this morning that

00:45:01.379 --> 00:45:05.299
if you're not saved, that event, the rapture, is gonna take place and you'll

00:45:05.299 --> 00:45:11.979
be left behind. If you've heard the gospel, if you're here this morning, you're

00:45:11.979 --> 00:45:16.179
watching live stream, you've heard the gospel. God says that you'll believe a

00:45:16.179 --> 00:45:24.379
lie. You'll believe a lie. The Bible tells us that after that Millennial reign of

00:45:24.379 --> 00:45:28.739
Christ, there's this event called the Great White Throne Judgment. The Bible

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:33.139
tells us that the dead, small and great, are gonna stand before God. They're gonna

00:45:33.139 --> 00:45:40.459
be judged. The Bible says that if you've not been born again, that you'll be cast

00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:46.379
in a lake of fire. This is the second death. Prior to that truth in Revelation

00:45:46.379 --> 00:45:49.739
20, for those that would be ruling and reigning with Christ during his

00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:53.659
Millennial Kingdom, the Bible says that the second death has no power on us

00:45:53.659 --> 00:45:58.779
because we've been born again. Could I encourage you this morning to let

00:45:58.779 --> 00:46:01.659
someone take a Bible and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:06.099
your home? Oh, I would beg of you not to leave here without knowing for

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:14.179
sure that heaven is your home. 24 years ago, I guess it was, when I understood

00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:19.379
that I was a sinner in need of a Savior and that Jesus Christ was the only

00:46:19.499 --> 00:46:24.819
Savior. I understood that he died for me and he paid for me what I could not pay on my

00:46:24.819 --> 00:46:28.619
own. And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:35.099
and he gave me life. He gave me abundant life. He gave me eternal life. And my

00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:42.019
desire, even as Paul says, my desire is that he, Christ, would be my life. I'll be

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:44.459
honest with you this morning, I don't know that I can stand here with as much

00:46:44.459 --> 00:46:49.899
assurance as Paul did and say he is my life. But I want him to be. I want him to

00:46:49.899 --> 00:46:54.699
have preeminence in my life. And I hope that you do as well. And then as we

00:46:54.699 --> 00:47:01.659
consider this promise. Listen, he's going to appear. Don't get bogged down with

00:47:01.659 --> 00:47:05.779
what's going on in our world. Just know that we're on the winning side.

00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:09.899
Curtis Hudson used to sing the song all the time. We're on the winning side. I've

00:47:09.899 --> 00:47:15.299
read the back of the book and we win. Amen. We're on the winning side. This

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:21.899
distinct perspective and then we find this this promise when Christ shall

00:47:21.899 --> 00:47:27.219
appear. Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:30.379
your word and the truth contained therein. We pray God that you would help

00:47:30.379 --> 00:47:34.819
us to honor you and glorify you through all that we say and all that we do. I

00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:39.659
thank you God for your word and for the truth contained therein. If there's one

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:43.499
that's not sure of heaven, oh God would you please help them today to understand

00:47:43.499 --> 00:47:50.059
their need for Christ. For those that have been born again, would you help us

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:55.859
God to understand the truth and the teaching of your word with regard to

00:47:55.859 --> 00:48:03.579
prophecy, eschatology. Help us Lord to keep our focus on those truths and not

00:48:03.579 --> 00:48:07.899
to get discouraged or bogged down in this world. Would you bless our time of

00:48:07.899 --> 00:48:11.459
invitation that decisions would be made that would please thee. Well thank you

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:14.579
for what you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me

00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:19.259
heads are bowed, eyes are closed. I'm gonna have a moment of invitation when we give

00:48:19.259 --> 00:48:23.259
you an opportunity to respond to the Word of God. Perhaps this morning you're

00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:26.259
not sure of heaven and you'd like to have someone take a Bible and show you

00:48:26.259 --> 00:48:29.459
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home. Perhaps this morning you have

00:48:29.459 --> 00:48:33.139
some other area of your life in which the Lord has spoken to your heart and

00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:36.899
you want to come to this old-fashioned altar and you want to pray and ask God

00:48:36.899 --> 00:48:43.019
to help you. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
