WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
In verse number 1, Titus is given the admonition from the Apostle Paul to speak now the things

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.760
which become sound doctrine.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.260
And so from that verse of Scripture, we have taken the opportunity to deal with some doctrinal

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.479
truth and to deal with sound doctrine.

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:22.020
And we studied for a few weeks the doctrine of the Scriptures, Bibliology.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.540
And last week we began, we had our first lesson on the subject matter of theology.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.940
We examined the book of Jeremiah, the 10th chapter, verses 1 through 18.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.200
And we emphasized the importance of theology and we said that there are many today that

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.080
have questions about who God is, what God's like, and how you can have a relationship

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.080
with God, how you relate to God.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.479
And all of those answers must be found within the pages of Scripture.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.380
We understand that there are people today that are seeking to give answers and explanations

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.639
and describe who God is and how God works, but they're giving answers that are void of

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.360
this book, and therefore they're erroneous.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.720
And so we must understand the source of our doctrine.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.480
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, is profitable for doctrine.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.400
And we established those points last week.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.080
As we studied that portion in Jeremiah 10, I mentioned to you that in verse number 6,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.800
it would serve as the basic outline for our study of theology.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.940
That verse says this, for as much as there is none like unto thee, O Lord, thou art great

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.860
and thy name is great.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.879
Last week we looked at the first section of that verse of Scripture, for as much as there

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:39.519
is none like unto thee, O Lord, there's no one like our God, amen?

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.480
And what a blessing that is.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.500
And this evening, the second phrase of that verse of Scripture in Jeremiah 10 in verse

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.720
number 6 says this, thou art great.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.480
And so if you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the lesson tonight,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.360
The Greatness of God, Part 1.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.559
And I've already planned that we'll have a Part 2, and so we'll have Part 1 this evening.

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:07.620
And as we focus on that phrase, thou art great, and take these couple of weeks to examine

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.679
the greatness of God and really looking at the attributes of God.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.800
Attributes have been defined as being qualities or characteristics that are inherent in or

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.440
ascribed to someone.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.720
So we begin to look at the attributes of God, and this evening we're going to look at the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.199
natural attributes of God.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:31.559
Next Wednesday evening, we'll look at the moral attributes of God and seek to understand

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.039
that indeed, as the Scriptures say, our God is great.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.960
Psalm 48 says, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.960
When we understand how great He is, it causes us to stand in awe of who He is.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.880
Notice in Psalm 135, in verse number 1, the Bible says,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.119
Praise ye the Lord, praise ye the name of the Lord.

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:58.000
Praise Him, O ye servants of the Lord, ye that stand in the house of the Lord and the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.600
courts of the house of our God.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.119
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good.

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.119
Sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:12.220
For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself in Israel for His peculiar treasure.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.539
Notice this in verse number 5, for I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.820
is above all gods.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.660
And remember, in the Old Testament, you deal with many references with the idolatrous worship

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.940
of the inhabitants of the land and then even of the people of the Lord.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.500
And so we find that here the psalmist is declaring, I know that the Lord is great.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.460
You look here and then look over at what the psalmist says in Psalm 145, and I want to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.860
just share this thought with you and then get into the natural attributes of God this

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.860
evening.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.740
In Psalm 145, again in verse number 1, the Bible says,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.699
I will extol Thee, my God, O King, and I will bless Thy name forever and ever.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.660
Every day will I bless Thee, and I will praise Thy name forever and ever.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.979
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.940
But I want you to notice what it continues to say here in verse number 4.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.059
It says, one generation shall praise Thy works to another, and shall declare Thy mighty acts.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:26.160
I will speak of the glorious honor of Thy majesty and of Thy wondrous works, and men

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.339
shall speak of the might of Thy terrible acts.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:35.619
Notice the last phrase of verse number 6, and I will declare Thy greatness.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:40.100
I notice the statement that is made in verse number 4 when it says, one generation shall

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.660
praise Thy works to another, and shall declare Thy mighty acts.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.459
God has established within His Word the principle of generational influence.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.739
That one generation is to influence and impact the next generation.

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:59.059
We understand that Jude says that we're to earnestly contend for the faith that was once

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.260
delivered unto the saints.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.299
There were a generation before us that were faithful to deliver the body of doctrine that

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:12.019
we hold dear, and now our responsibility is to give that truth to another generation.

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:19.420
I believe that as you examine and do a little research in our particular era in which we're

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.940
living, you will find that there are a number of places in which this principle has broken

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.940
down.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.980
We have a generation that's gone before us that did not properly influence a future generation,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.299
and you have a generation of people, sometimes even brought up in church, that do not know

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:42.339
the greatness of God.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.859
And that's sad, and it shouldn't be that way.

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:47.140
It's our responsibility.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.420
The church is the pillar and ground of the truth, and we have a great responsibilityâ€”listen,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.500
the young people in our church, they ought to know that our God is great, not just because

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.859
we sing about it, but because we declare it and we show it from the precious pages of

00:06:01.859 --> 00:06:02.859
this book.

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:09.100
Let me show you why we have come to the proper conclusion that the psalmist came to in saying,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.339
I know that the Lord is great.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:17.980
And our young people need to understand that, and what a great opportunity we have.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.779
As we think about the greatness of God and we think about the attributes, as I mentioned,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.700
we'll deal with the natural attributes this evening, the moral attributes next Wednesday

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700
evening.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.540
The natural attributes of God, it's been said this way, that they manifest the greatness

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.540
of God.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:41.380
Now, many of these things, no doubt, we could just list them off, and we have heard it before,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.420
we kind of have known these things, but I hope this evening that as we just take a few

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.899
moments to examine these five attributes that we're going to look at, that it would cause

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:58.339
us to rejoice and to praise our God and to stand in awe of Him, and then to make the

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:03.380
decision that because I know that He's great, I'm going to seek to share that with someone

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.339
else.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:08.260
Because there's a world that is in darkness.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.859
If our gospel be hid, according to what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4, it is hid to them

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:13.859
that are lost.

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:18.100
And so we have a great opportunity to declare the greatness of God.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.739
If you were to go and take a little survey of people that you come in contact with, I

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:27.459
would venture to say that most of them that you encounter on a daily basis, they do not

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:30.500
know the greatness of God.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500
They don't know.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.019
They're unaware.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:37.299
And we have the privilege of being able to share with them the truth of the Scripture.

00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:42.700
Number one, the first attribute that we'll deal with is that God is omniscient.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.700
God is omniscient.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.940
We often speak about the omniscience of God, that He's all-knowing, that He has perfect

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.220
knowledge, that He has all wisdom.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.220
And we believe that, we can say that, but let's look at a few verses of Scripture.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.820
I will say this at the very beginning.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.820
We're going to go to a number of passages this evening, but as we do, you understand

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:08.820
that in no place are we using an exhaustive list of Scriptures to prove these attributes

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.820
of God.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.619
We'd be here for many weeks if we were going to do that, and so I've just taken a sampling

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:18.519
of verses of Scripture this evening to prove each of these attributes biblically.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:23.980
And so Job chapter number 42, if you would, go over to Job chapter number 42, and we'll

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.220
go through a number of verses here with each of these points dealing with the attributes

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.500
of God, again, the natural attributes of God.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.539
In Job 42, Job answered the Lord.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:41.659
In verse number one, the Bible tells us that Job is speaking here and answering the Lord.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.380
Take notice here of what Job says.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:52.700
He says, I know that thou canst do everything, and that no thought can be withholden from

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
thee.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.500
By the way, that's a good realization for us as the people of God to make, to understand

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.539
that God knows all things, that God knows even our thoughts.

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:08.179
As we would study the Scriptures in the New Testament gospel records of the life and ministry

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:11.260
of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will find on a number of occasions where the Bible will

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.020
tell us that the Lord knew their thoughts.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:20.440
Before they ever made any comments, as they just reasoned amongst themselves, Jesus knew

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.739
their thoughts and answered their questions, and on many occasions left them speechless.

00:09:26.739 --> 00:09:32.340
And here we find that Job rightly concludes that God can do anything.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.340
Everything is what he says.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.900
I know that thou canst do everything, and really that's some revelation with regard

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.219
to the omnipotence of God, which will be our next point.

00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:45.539
And then he says this, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.059
Turn to Psalm 139, if you will.

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:54.179
Look again at a number of verses, and I just selected a handful for each of these points

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:55.340
this evening.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.260
In Psalm 139, the psalmist says this.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.099
The psalmist has been a scribe.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:07.059
to David in verse number one. Oh Lord thou hast searched me and known me. Thou

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:12.739
knowest my down sitting and mine uprising. Thou understandest my thought

00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:21.259
afar off. Thou understandest my thought afar off. Look at verse chapter 147 here

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:29.339
in the book of Psalms and look at verses four and five. I love looking at Psalm

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:34.219
147 verse number four when you couple it with the truth of the the record of

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:38.859
creation that God gives us in Genesis 1 and verse 16 where the last several

00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:43.579
words of that verse say he made the stars also and we know that there's a

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:48.579
great number of stars and here it tells us in Psalm 147 in verse number four he

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:55.059
telleth the number of the stars and then it says this he calleth them all by

00:10:55.059 --> 00:11:02.139
their names. Verse five great is our Lord and of great power again the

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:06.299
omnipotence of God but notice the last phrase of verse number five his

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:12.299
understanding is infinite. His understanding is infinite. Paul says this

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:17.179
in Romans chapter 11 as he's writing here about this very subject of the

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:22.579
wisdom of God and we again understand that our God is omniscient. He has all

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:28.819
knowledge perfect knowledge and here as as Paul would rightly conclude and

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:33.179
obviously it's it's the Word of God but notice what is said here it's such a

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:40.259
beautiful portion of Scripture in verse number 33 of Romans 11. Oh the depth of

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:48.179
the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:55.539
his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the

00:11:55.539 --> 00:12:02.259
Lord or who hath been his counselor or who hath first given to him and it shall

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:07.019
be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:14.019
things notice to whom be glory forever amen. We understand this evening that our

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:19.459
God is omniscient he has all knowledge all wisdom that ought to cause us to

00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:24.699
rejoice when we understand listen I don't have all wisdom and all knowledge

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:28.259
and neither do you there are times in which we wish we did there are times in

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:32.739
which we knew we could figure out all of the problems of life but the reality

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:36.139
this evening is that as we begin to look at these attributes and understand who

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:41.059
God is that we stand in all of him but we also rejoice and praise him and

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:46.939
recognize that that we're his children and so when I lack wisdom I know the one

00:12:46.939 --> 00:12:52.379
who possesses all wisdom that I can go to him in prayer and seek his face and

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:57.739
ask him for that wisdom that he promises to give and what a blessing that is

00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:02.579
number two not only that God is omniscient God is omnipotent and in this

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:08.379
reveals to us that he has all power he has perfect power Job 9 4 is a great

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:12.779
verse really that kind of several of these already have dealt with both the

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:18.459
omniscience and the omnipotence of God but I love what Job 9 4 reveals to us

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:24.499
about both of these first two attributes that we deal with and in here Job is

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:28.419
replying to one of those that have been referenced as being his friends and of

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:33.419
course they're miserable comforters but he says in verse number four of Job 9 he

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:40.179
speaking of God is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:42.779
himself against him and hath prospered but I want you to notice the first

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:47.259
portion of verse number four that he's wise in heart and mighty in strength I'm

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:51.579
thankful that God is omniscient but I'm also thankful that he's omnipotent he

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:58.259
has all wisdom all perfect knowledge but he also has all power so he knows what

00:13:58.579 --> 00:14:03.859
has to be done and he has the power to do it there are times in which we could

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:07.699
look at different circumstances in which we have in life and we say I'm not sure

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:13.739
how to do it but maybe I have the the power the strength to do whatever the

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:18.259
task is and maybe we lean on somebody else's wisdom and we say you tell me how

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:23.099
to do this and I'll do it I don't have the knowledge to do it but I have the

00:14:23.099 --> 00:14:27.379
strength to be able to do it in in reverse form there are some that have

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:30.419
the knowledge to know how to do it but they no longer have the physical

00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:35.939
abilities to do it and we understand that as human beings in life but we

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:41.019
understand that our God he has all wisdom and he has all power he knows

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:45.539
what to do and he has the power to do it and that ought to cause us to rejoice

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:50.819
this evening he says to to Abraham we won't turn there for sake of time but in

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:56.499
Genesis 18 14 he asked that question is anything too hard for the Lord and

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:00.259
really we understand what he's saying when he asked that question of Abraham

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:03.779
he's saying to Abraham he's already introduced himself and revealed himself

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:08.139
as being El Shaddai the Lord God Almighty in that same text of Scripture

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:13.899
and he's saying this to Abraham there's nothing too hard for me I have all power

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:20.139
Jeremiah recognized that we find that Jesus says this in Matthew 28 a portion

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:23.219
of Scripture that we often reference when we speak about the Great Commission

00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:29.019
and these are the words of Jesus as he would ascend to heaven and of course we

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:35.419
see the the truth in all of the Gospels with regard to the Great Commission and

00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:39.899
here Jesus says this and as it's recorded by Matthew in verse 18 of

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:44.699
Matthew 28 he came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:52.619
heaven and in earth aren't you thankful that God has all power in fact Revelation

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:59.339
19 in verse number 6 reveals this truth to us I'll give you a moment to turn

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:05.419
there Revelation 19 and verse number 6 the Bible says this and I heard as it

00:16:05.419 --> 00:16:09.979
were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the

00:16:09.979 --> 00:16:15.739
voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent

00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:20.619
raineth you understand this evening that our God has all power and that he still

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:25.539
reigns he's in control and he has all power and we begin to think about the

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:29.619
greatness of God and we look at these first two attributes and say okay what

00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:33.859
why do we come to this conclusion that God is great why do we make this

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:38.939
declaration that God is great why do we sing songs about the greatness of God

00:16:38.939 --> 00:16:43.739
well because we can say as the psalmist said I know the Lord is great number one

00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:50.339
he's got all knowledge all wisdom number two he's got all power number three he

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:56.459
is omnipresent he's omnipresent what do you mean by that well he's everywhere

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:00.499
present God is a spirit they that worship him must worship him in spirit

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:05.099
and truth John 4 and verse 24 we understand that and we begin to think

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:10.819
about the omnipresence of God and how it would cause us as the people of God to

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.779
rejoice in understanding this go back to the book of Psalms if you will and we'll

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:19.939
look at a few verses of Scripture here with regard to the the truth before us

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:28.339
of the omnipresence of God the psalmist here in Psalm 139 we mentioned the

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.539
first two verses we looked at the omniscience of God and as you look at

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:36.179
verse number 7 down through verse number 12 you see the psalmist is referencing

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:40.659
here and his understanding of the omnipresence of God it says this wither

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:47.099
shall I go from thy spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:51.939
ascend up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou art

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:55.659
there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the

00:17:55.659 --> 00:18:00.859
sea even there shall thy hand lead me and the right hand shall hold me if I

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:04.939
say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me

00:18:04.939 --> 00:18:09.219
yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:15.099
darkness and the light are both alike to thee and the psalmist is revealing to us

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:19.619
in these verses of Scripture this truth with regard to the omnipresence of God

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:23.499
that is everywhere present no doubt there have been times in our lives that

00:18:23.499 --> 00:18:28.819
we wish we could be at two places at the same time you know I wish I could be

00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:31.859
over here taking care of that I wish I could be over here doing this but we

00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:36.859
can't we're limited we can be at one place at one time and it doesn't matter

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:40.179
how many people are vying for our attention it doesn't matter how many

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:45.459
things need to be addressed we are limited of being in one place at one

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:49.699
time but our God is omnipresent he's everywhere present it would begin to

00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:54.099
think about that truth and obviously that truth would bring comfort to the

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:59.259
people of God as his children as we would be mindful of verses of Scripture

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:03.339
like Matthew 28 and verse number 20 he gave in verse number 18 that he has all

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:08.259
power given unto him in verse number 20 at the end of the Great Commission he

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:13.619
says in lo I am with you always and you think about that comfort that the child

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:18.019
of God will receive by understanding that God has promised to be with us in

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:22.899
Hebrews 13 in verse number 5 he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thing

00:19:22.899 --> 00:19:28.539
and as the the people of God to know even as the psalmist in that very

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:32.099
familiar portion of Scripture in Psalm 23 yea though I walk through the valley

00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:38.099
of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why for thou art with me and what

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:43.259
joy and comfort that brings to the child of God and when you're in the place

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:47.139
where you are and I'm in the place where I am and we're not in the presence of

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:51.979
one another we can have this confidence that God is with you just as he's with

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:58.779
me and that's amazing the greatness of God that he's omnipresent notice not

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:02.419
only does it bring comfort to

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:06.059
to the child of God, but I believe that it also can bring some conviction to the child

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.899
of God, for God is in every place.

00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:13.299
In Proverbs 15, if you want to jot down just a couple of verses of Scripture, notice what

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:17.339
the Bible says in Proverbs 15, and we'll look at a verse over in the book of Jeremiah as

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:18.859
well.

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:24.179
In Proverbs 15, in verse number 3, the Bible says this, the eyes of the Lord are in every

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:27.899
place, beholding the evil and the good.

00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:31.939
Man, don't you wish sometimes you had eyes in all the places that you thought you need

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.659
to have eyes?

00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:36.939
How many of you moms ever said that you had mom eyes?

00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:40.939
Holly calls them back eyes, and what does she mean by that?

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:44.819
Well, the kids do something and she sees them, quote unquote, and they're like, how did you

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:45.819
see me do that?

00:20:45.819 --> 00:20:47.299
She said, I have mom eyes.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:51.299
Well, she's just kidding, and she noticed something that they were doing that they,

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:56.859
of course, didn't know she was watching, but the reality is that God sees everything.

00:20:56.859 --> 00:21:01.659
The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the good and the evil, and we see

00:21:01.659 --> 00:21:07.939
that, and we, the evil and the good, I quote it in reverse order, but we find that God

00:21:07.939 --> 00:21:10.259
is omnipresent and that He sees all things.

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:14.939
Notice what Jeremiah says in Jeremiah chapter 23.

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:22.819
Jeremiah is, of course, prophesying to rebellious Judah, and you can look through and see much

00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:28.979
of the prophecies that are given in dealing with these folks that are not repentant.

00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:35.699
And here, notice with me in verse number 21 of Jeremiah 23, I have not sent these prophets,

00:21:35.699 --> 00:21:40.699
yea, they ran, I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied, but if they had stood

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:45.099
in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned

00:21:45.099 --> 00:21:48.019
them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:53.139
Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off?

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:56.899
Notice what he says in verse 24, can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:59.659
see him, saith the Lord?

00:21:59.659 --> 00:22:04.259
Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:08.579
Ezekiel, in particular, we don't take time to go over there and look at the portion of

00:22:08.579 --> 00:22:12.739
Scripture, but Ezekiel is prophesying and he's dealing with those that have been taken

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:18.459
into captivity, and there are some that have that idea that, well, no one sees what I'm

00:22:18.459 --> 00:22:24.339
doing, but God is aware of it because God is omnipresent, he's everywhere.

00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:28.979
So we see this evening he's omniscient, he's omnipotent, he's omnipresent.

00:22:28.979 --> 00:22:32.259
Number four, God is immutable.

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:33.259
He's immutable.

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:34.259
What do we mean by that?

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:37.339
Well, he's always the same, he never changes.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:41.859
I've often said, and I'll repeat it again this evening, that I believe that this is

00:22:41.979 --> 00:22:46.139
really, quote-unquote, the glue of Bible doctrine.

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:51.299
And the reason that I say that is because if God was not immutable, how would we know

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:56.059
how to approach him from generation to generation, from era to era?

00:22:56.059 --> 00:23:01.779
We would have a lack of knowledge as to how to approach him because he changes.

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:08.859
But the reality is that God has revealed to us in his Word that he is immutable, that

00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:14.659
he does not change, and therefore, because he does not change, we can take the truth

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:19.859
of the Word of God that was given to us and we can say he's the same because he said

00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:20.859
he didn't change.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:23.619
And so God is just as holy today as he's ever been.

00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:25.799
He's just as powerful today as he's ever been.

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:28.059
He's just as wise today as he's ever been.

00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:29.059
Why?

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.059
Because he doesn't change.

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:36.379
And we understand that people are saved today the same way they were saved when Paul was

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:38.379
preaching, right?

00:23:38.379 --> 00:23:43.419
Salvation is through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:49.859
And we can rejoice in understanding that God has given us the Word of God.

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:51.819
He's given us the plan of redemption.

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:56.579
He's revealed to us what pleases him, what does not please him, and we can have this

00:23:56.579 --> 00:23:59.979
confidence in this book because he doesn't change.

00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:00.979
He's the same.

00:24:00.979 --> 00:24:04.899
Malachi says this, speaking of the attribute of God.

00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:15.099
He says in Malachi chapter number 3 and verse number 6, he says, I am the Lord, I change

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:16.099
not.

00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:23.699
Therefore, ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

00:24:23.699 --> 00:24:31.539
Hebrews 13 and verse number 8 says, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:35.659
Now we have relationships with people in life.

00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:40.699
You know, the people that we have relationships with, we'd say that people change, right?

00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:42.099
Do you agree with that?

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:43.099
People change.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:51.859
In fact, sometimes people change kind of their countenance and their dealings might change

00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:54.659
even in a single day.

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:58.359
And sometimes we can struggle with how we approach individuals because we don't know

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:04.519
how we're going to find them and what spirit or attitude they will be in, right?

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.639
We understand that in life.

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:08.479
But God changes not.

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:09.479
He's the same.

00:25:09.479 --> 00:25:12.279
He says, I am the Lord, I change not.

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:15.279
Therefore, ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:21.319
And I'm so thankful this evening that God has revealed to us in his word that he's immutable.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.039
He doesn't change.

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:27.379
Now we finish with this thought with regard to the attributes of God that we're looking

00:25:27.379 --> 00:25:34.019
at this evening, the natural attributes, and that is number five, that God is eternal.

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:35.139
He's eternal.

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:36.739
Our God has no beginning and no end.

00:25:36.739 --> 00:25:41.739
I said last week as we started our series on this doctrine of theology that the Bible

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:47.739
does not seek to prove the existence of God, it simply declares the existence of God.

00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:49.659
In the beginning, God.

00:25:49.659 --> 00:25:53.939
We find that the Bible tells us that the heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament showeth

00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:55.979
forth as handiwork.

00:25:56.339 --> 00:26:02.899
There are the truth of the word of God, there are many references to declare to us the existence

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:05.979
of God, and the Bible tells us that God is eternal.

00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:08.459
He has no beginning and no end.

00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:11.179
He is alpha and omega.

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:15.339
And people, I had somebody on the driveway of the parking lot not long ago, just a couple

00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:19.859
of weeks ago, when I spoke to them and I was sharing truth with them about the Lord, and

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:25.139
I mentioned about God being the creator, and they said, yeah, and who created God?

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:27.779
Just kind of like that, shaking their head at me.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:30.899
And so the reality is that no one created God.

00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:31.899
God is God.

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:38.459
He has always existed, and He's declared this truth to us in His word.

00:26:38.459 --> 00:26:46.219
We find this night, as we look at this last thought with regard to God being eternal,

00:26:46.219 --> 00:26:51.019
notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 90, in verse number 2, in Psalm 90, in verse

00:26:51.019 --> 00:27:03.259
number 2, the Bible says this, Psalm 90, verse 2,

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:10.379
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,

00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:19.619
Then from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:24.539
We think about the eternality of God, we understand in Revelation chapter 1, I'll just give you

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:28.699
the reference, I want to look at a passage over to Exodus here as we conclude, but in

00:27:28.699 --> 00:27:33.499
Revelation 1, verse number 4, and then again in verse number 8, the Bible talks about the

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:39.379
fact that our God is eternal, He is, He was, He is to come, I am alpha and omega, the beginning

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:43.739
and the end, the first and the last, He's the Almighty, according to verse number 8

00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:50.099
of Revelation 1, and how we can rejoice in understanding the truth of the eternality

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:56.499
of God, remember it was when Jesus, there in John chapter 1, John the Baptist is speaking

00:27:56.499 --> 00:28:00.939
about Jesus, and he says, there comes one after me who is preferred above me because

00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:06.299
He was before me, and when you think about that whole context of what John the Baptist

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:11.379
is speaking of, he's speaking of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the reality

00:28:11.379 --> 00:28:17.819
is that John the Baptist, physically speaking, was older, Elizabeth gave birth before Mary

00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:20.939
did, but how was Jesus before him?

00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:24.139
Well, because He's eternal.

00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:29.779
In John 17, we find that as Jesus is praying, He says, He speaks about the glory that He

00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:34.579
had with God in eternity past.

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:39.579
And I want you to notice in Exodus chapter 3, we'll finish up with this tonight, as we

00:28:39.579 --> 00:28:44.619
think about the eternality of God, we'll be familiar with the passage of Scripture as

00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:50.940
here God is speaking to Moses, and the call of Moses, the instruction of Moses here, that

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:57.419
we hear those words when God says to Moses, I am that I am, remember when Moses said whom

00:28:57.419 --> 00:29:00.179
shall I say sent me?

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:01.539
What name should I give them?

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.619
What shall I say unto them?

00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:03.619
And they say, what is His name?

00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:06.019
And He says, I am that I am.

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:09.700
Remember Jesus said in John 8, in verse number 58, when He's speaking to the religious leaders

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.820
of the day, He's speaking about Abraham rejoices to see his day.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.859
And they said, man, you're not even 50 years old, what are you talking about?

00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:21.179
And He says, before Abraham was, I am.

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:26.299
And we find here that in this text of Scripture in Exodus chapter 3, that the children of

00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:29.579
Israel are currently in Egyptian bondage.

00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:32.099
They're dealing with great difficulty.

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:38.779
And God is going to appear to Moses, and He appears to him in this flame of fire out of

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:43.619
the midst of a bush, and Moses in verse number 3, he says this, I will now turn aside and

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:46.500
see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.979
And God called unto him, and Moses said, here am I, and God says, the place whereon thou

00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:53.619
standest is holy ground.

00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:59.380
But notice the content of the message in which God will give to Moses.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.579
In verse number 6, moreover, He said, God is speaking.

00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:09.159
He says, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God

00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:10.899
of Jacob.

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:15.119
So understand that he is the God of the past.

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:16.439
He's eternal.

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:17.679
He's speaking to Moses.

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:23.679
He says, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:28.059
Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:33.399
Notice what the Lord says in verse number seven, I have surely seen the affliction of

00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:38.479
my people, which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for

00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:41.359
I know their sorrows.

00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:46.039
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:49.979
up out of the land into a good land and a large into a land flowing with milk and honey

00:30:49.979 --> 00:30:54.079
into the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites, the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:55.399
and the Jebusites.

00:30:55.459 --> 00:31:00.459
So we see in verses seven and eight that not only is God the God of the past, according

00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:04.059
to verse number six, but he's the God of the present, according to verse seven and eight.

00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:06.959
He knew what they were actively going through.

00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:08.459
He knew what they were dealing with.

00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:12.699
He knew that by reason of the taskmasters, he said, I know their sorrows.

00:31:12.699 --> 00:31:15.539
I hear their cry.

00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:16.739
Notice he's the God of the future.

00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:20.139
He tells Moses this in verse number 10.

00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:26.439
He says, come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring

00:31:26.439 --> 00:31:31.559
forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.959
Is that what happened?

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:34.919
Absolutely, it's what happened.

00:31:34.919 --> 00:31:35.919
Why?

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:36.919
Because he's eternal.

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:41.659
And so he can speak God as he's revealing himself to Moses.

00:31:41.659 --> 00:31:47.479
He speaks about the past, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, about the present, the current

00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:52.019
affliction of the people of God in Egyptian bondage, and about the future that they were

00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:55.179
going to be delivered out of Egyptian bondage.

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:58.459
Our God is eternal.

00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:03.859
And we look this evening at these five natural attributes of God, the omniscience of God,

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:09.459
the omnipotence of God, the omnipresence of God, the immutability of God, and the eternality

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:14.019
of God, and we stand in awe of who he is.

00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:20.719
Apart from this book, you'd never come to this conclusion.

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:26.039
We find, again, as I mentioned last week, that there are tribes all around the globe

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:28.459
where they do not have a written revelation.

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:34.599
They worship some deity, they have some knowledge of there being some God, but we, because of

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:40.399
the revelation of the nature, yes, we understand there's a God, but then the revelation contained

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:46.239
within this book reveals to us who he is, his attributes.

00:32:46.239 --> 00:32:52.939
And when we read these attributes, we stand in awe of him, and we conclude, as the Bible

00:32:52.939 --> 00:32:59.419
told us in Jeremiah 10 and verse number 6, for as much as there is none like unto thee,

00:32:59.419 --> 00:33:06.499
O Lord, there's none like him, for thou art great.

00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:12.639
This evening, we've just, for a little while, scratched the surface of the greatness of

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:20.679
God, and I hope this evening that we would stand in awe of him, that we would, as we

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:29.039
look at these attributes, praise him and rejoice that we have the privilege of being called

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.039
his children.

00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:32.519
Isn't that amazing?

00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:37.139
That this God, that's, if you read, I'll give you a homework assignment, quote-unquote,

00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:40.539
go and read Psalm 48 before you go to bed this evening.

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:44.499
It's not, it's only 15 verses or something like that, it's not very long, but Psalm 48

00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:49.259
starts out with a song that we sing, Psalm 48, 1 and 2, great is the Lord, right?

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:50.819
We sing it, greatly to be praised, right?

00:33:50.819 --> 00:33:56.019
We sing about the greatness of God, and the last verse of that passage says this, for

00:33:56.019 --> 00:34:06.159
this God is our God, and oh, how that ought to cause us to rejoice, and really to be humbled

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:11.359
that we have the privilege of knowing him, that he's revealed himself to us, he's taken

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:18.699
an interest in us, and we can say with the psalmist, I know the Lord is great.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:23.599
But just as the psalmist said in Psalm 145, one generation has to declare his greatness

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:31.019
to another generation, and the psalmist stands up and says, I will speak of thy greatness.

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:37.219
And this evening, we need to, in like fashion, stand up with the psalmist and say, I know

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:45.259
the Lord is great, and I will speak of thy greatness, I will declare thy greatness.

00:34:45.259 --> 00:34:46.259
Let's pray together.

00:34:46.259 --> 00:34:49.019
Father, we love you, and we thank you for loving us.

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:58.179
We stand in awe of who you are, as we look at these verses of Scripture, as we see how

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:07.499
you have revealed yourself to us, Lord, we are humbled.

00:35:07.499 --> 00:35:13.539
We're privileged to know you.

00:35:13.539 --> 00:35:18.859
We are aware this evening that we live in the midst of a generation of people that do

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:19.859
not know you.

00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:22.739
They do not know the God of the Bible.

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:30.659
God, I pray that you'd help us tonight to not only praise you and stand in awe of you,

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:38.259
but Lord, help us tonight to make a commitment to declare thy greatness, that we'd seize

00:35:38.259 --> 00:35:45.219
the opportunities that you would give us, to let others know how great you are.

00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:48.539
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:35:48.539 --> 00:35:53.299
We thank you so much for the privilege of prayer, to know that we can enter into your

00:35:53.299 --> 00:36:01.499
presence to bring these petitions before thy throne, understanding that you are aware,

00:36:01.499 --> 00:36:03.699
you are able.

00:36:03.699 --> 00:36:08.339
I pray that you would do exceeding abundantly above all that we could ask or think.

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:13.779
God, you would work in a distinct way in which you alone would be glorified, and we'll thank

00:36:13.779 --> 00:36:14.779
you for it.

00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:16.779
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:36:16.779 --> 00:36:19.259
Let me take your prayer bulletin.
