1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
for the opportunity to preach through the book of Colossians here in this calendar year.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,100
And I have been encouraged and strengthened, and what a blessing to have the Word of God.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,100
Amen.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,300
And it's interesting, I was sharing with someone just this morning, and had been sharing with

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:23,020
my family earlier in the week, how that when you look at these truths in the Word of God,

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,940
how applicable they still are for today.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,659
And we understand that the Word of God is the living Word of God, and it's written by

8
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:37,459
the eternal God, and therefore it is relevant for every people group.

9
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:41,020
It's relevant in every era of human history.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,779
And there are some that think that the Bible is outdated, it needs to be updated, or whatever.

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,419
They'll say, well, it's not relevant.

12
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,520
It is so relevant.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,360
And we find that as we dig into the Word of God, that God will give us truth that is applicable

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,619
and relevant in the day in which we are living.

15
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,540
If it were true in Paul's day and Peter's day, and we know that it is, that there were

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,459
false teachers that were active, we would say assuredly this morning that false teachers

17
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,879
continue to be prevalent.

18
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,019
We understand that as we look at the passage of Scripture, as we look at the end of chapter

19
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:19,360
number one of the book of Colossians and then get into chapter two, we find that the apostle

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,660
Paul had shared with these believers in Colossae, and we've studied it, how that really the

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,099
philosophy of his ministry.

22
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:32,220
What was the ministry that God had placed him in, that God had called him to?

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,839
It was to preach Christ, it was to warn every man, and it was to teach every man for the

24
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:42,739
express purpose of being able to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

25
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,220
What a great summarized statement of the ministry.

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,699
Not only the aspects of ministry, but the purpose of ministry.

27
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,099
As we studied last week, and you look at the first few verses of Colossians 2, we find

28
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:02,019
that Paul then is revealing to these believers in Colossae about this great conflict that

29
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:07,080
he has, not only for the believers in Colossae, but for those in Laodicea and for all of them

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,460
that had not seen his face in the flesh.

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,500
And as we studied last week and we dealt with that great conflict, we said we understood

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,419
that Paul had such great concern and care for these believers that the way in which

33
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,580
he described that care and concern was a great conflict.

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,339
What was it that caused this great conflict in the life of the Apostle Paul?

35
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:35,779
Nothing other than these false teachers that were active, not only in Colossae, but we

36
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:40,919
find in Laodicea and in many other regions in which the gospel had gone forth.

37
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:48,860
And Paul has this great conflict and he desires to warn these believers in Colossae.

38
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:55,500
We, of course, understand as he summarized the ministry to preach Christ, warning every

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,539
man and teaching every man, and we find that the Bible tells us this in Psalm 19 and verse

40
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,779
number 11,

41
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:08,940
"...moreover by them," by the Scriptures, the law of the Lord is what is being referred

42
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,240
to in that portion of Scripture.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:18,919
He says this, "...moreover by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them,"

44
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,160
the Scriptures, "...there is great reward."

45
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,600
We looked a couple of weeks ago at the truth in 1 Corinthians 4 and verse number 14 when

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Paul said,

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,000
"...I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons, I warn you."

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,639
I warn you.

49
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,199
He's giving, extending this warning in order to protect these believers from these false

50
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,960
teachers and from this teaching that is going forward, and we find that then, after giving

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,080
a warning, he seeks to teach every man.

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,279
Why is it that he's seeking to teach?

53
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:59,679
Well, as we said last week, spiritual growth is the most effective defense against false

54
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,679
teaching.

55
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:05,240
I mean, when you know what the Word of God says, when you have been settled and grounded

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,160
in the faith, when you've grown spiritually, not that you ever come to a place of arrival

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,339
because we'll find even as we study through the text this morning, it is a continual process

58
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:21,119
of growth, of spiritual growth, that when you are growing spiritually, you are able

59
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:28,559
to defend the truth of the Word of God and the false teachers, their teaching and their

60
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:33,640
philosophies just kind of fade away under the truth of the Word of God.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,959
We find that it was there that Peter said in Acts 6, dealing with some of the things

62
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,119
that were taking place there at the church in Jerusalem.

63
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:47,679
He speaks about him and the others, that they would give themselves to prayer and the ministry

64
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,200
of the Word.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,279
I'm thankful that God has given us the Word of God, and I'm thankful that He has instructed

66
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,980
us to teach and preach the Word of God, and what a blessing it is for us to have the Word

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
of God.

68
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,579
This morning we'll be looking at Colossians 2, verses 4 through 7.

69
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,179
The Bible says this,

70
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:13,619
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

71
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:22,940
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding

72
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,540
your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

73
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:38,339
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him, rooted and built

74
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:46,820
up in Him, and established in the faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with

75
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
thanksgiving.

76
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,059
If you're taking notes this morning, I've titled the message from verse 7, rooted and

77
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,179
built up in Christ.

78
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:59,059
Rooted and built up in Christ.

79
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,299
This is a great declaration with a great passage of Scripture, and as we study through it this

80
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:09,140
morning, I want you to take note, number one, note how Paul cautions these believers.

81
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,619
Again, we mentioned that in chapter number one, when he describes the ministry that God

82
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,220
had called him to, he says,

83
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,700
Warning every man.

84
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,220
And we find that in verse number four, Paul is going to begin this aspect of ministry

85
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,779
of issuing a warning, cautioning the people of God.

86
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:31,420
We find that the truth that is really started in verse number four will continue and be

87
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,700
more developed even in verse number eight, as we'll study next Sunday morning.

88
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,619
But we find that this danger that Paul is dealing with and the caution that he's giving

89
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:45,660
to these believers is exposed in verse number four.

90
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,779
He's exposing the tactic of the enemy.

91
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,459
He's dealing with what they need to be careful of and how they need to be cautioned.

92
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,579
We've often mentioned throughout the last several weeks how that we have grown accustomed

93
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,500
as human beings of receiving warnings, of receiving caution.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,739
And we see it on various items that we purchase, the various places that we go, caution, and

95
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:14,380
you'll see warning.

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,779
And those things are there to grab our attention and to help us take heed.

97
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,339
In fact, in verse number eight, it's not really, we're going to look at it in its entirety

98
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:30,019
next Sunday morning, but the verse begins with this wonderful word, beware.

99
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,899
Now when you see the word beware, you should take heed.

100
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,500
I mean, it gets your attention, amen?

101
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,619
And I remember as a child and even still today, if I'm out door knocking and visiting in the

102
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,260
neighborhoods and there's a fence and there's a sign that says beware of dog, I am taking

103
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,299
literally that warning that is posted on that fence.

104
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,299
Why?

105
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:54,739
Because I've gone into gates before and there's been a big dog that's come around the corner

106
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:59,660
and so therefore I'm taking heed to the warning and often what I will do is I will take that

107
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,739
gospel tract or that John and Romans and I will twist it up and stick it in the fence

108
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:07,100
and say, I hope they'll grab it and read it.

109
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
That's just what I do.

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Why?

111
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,299
Because there's a warning that's given.

112
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:16,579
There's certain things that you keep away from your children, chemicals that perhaps

113
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,260
you clean with.

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,200
There are warning labels on those things.

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,760
There are cautions.

116
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,880
And so here Paul is going to issue a caution to these believers in Colossae and as he's

117
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:35,919
issuing this warning, you understand that Paul is seeking to help these believers.

118
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,400
He loves them.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,479
He's not warning them so that they would forsake truth and follow him.

120
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,719
No, he's warning them because the deceivers, the false teachers are active among them and

121
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:53,159
Paul loves them and Paul wants to give them the truth.

122
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,119
This here in this passage of Scripture, you notice that he begins in verse number 70 and

123
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,239
says, and this I say.

124
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,320
Why is he saying this?

125
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,440
Well remember in the previous passage that we studied last week, he says I have this

126
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,039
great conflict for you and therefore because of this great conflict that I have and we

127
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,640
understood as we studied the passage and looked at the whole really of the message of the

128
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,479
book of Colossians that it was these false teachers that resulted in Paul having this

129
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,599
great conflict.

130
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:28,599
He says therefore I'm saying this to you, lest any man should beguile you with enticing

131
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,919
words.

132
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:38,239
That word beguile and it carries with it the idea of deception by false reasoning.

133
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:40,000
Deception by false reasoning.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,400
And he says this, he uses this phraseology with enticing words.

135
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,200
You know the reality is that if they would teach the truth of the word of God, they're

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
not going to beguile you.

137
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,559
But they have to use these enticing words in order to beguile you.

138
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,559
Why?

139
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,960
This deception by false reasoning.

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,040
And these enticing words are speech words

141
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,200
that are adapted to persuade.

142
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,980
It's specious discourse leading others into error.

143
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,320
That's what enticing words.

144
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,960
That's the idea of this truth

145
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,840
that Paul is giving to these believers in Colossae.

146
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,340
And so he's telling them,

147
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,040
listen, I want you to understand

148
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,600
the way in which these false teachers

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,120
are going to operate.

150
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
They're going to come in

151
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,360
and they're going to seek to beguile you

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,440
with these enticing words.

153
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,520
It's not something that's just captured

154
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,560
in the book of Colossians.

155
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
I want you to hold your place here

156
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,240
and look over to the book of 1 Timothy if you will.

157
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,080
We'll look at a few verses here this morning.

158
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,080
In 1 Timothy 4, we'll see this truth given here

159
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,560
that Paul is instructing Timothy,

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,840
his son in the faith.

161
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,360
And we understand if we could use the analogy this morning

162
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,760
that in a spiritual type of a manner,

163
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,640
the Apostle Paul is seeking to pass the baton to Timothy.

164
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,880
He understood that Timothy was his son in the faith.

165
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
He understood that God had called Timothy

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,560
and commissioned Timothy,

167
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
and Timothy was like-minded.

168
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,960
And so in the book of 1 and 2 Timothy,

169
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,640
Paul is investing in instructing Timothy

170
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
to take the next leg of the race, so to speak.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,040
And in 1 Timothy 4, the Bible says this,

172
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,400
that in the latter times,

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,080
some shall depart from the faith,

175
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,040
giving heed to seducing spirits

176
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,480
and doctrines of devils,

177
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,480
speaking lies in hypocrisy,

178
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,400
having their conscience seared with a hot iron,

179
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,440
forbidding to marry,

180
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,520
and commanding to abstain from meats

181
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,200
which God hath created

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,360
to be received with thanksgiving of them

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,120
which believe and know the truth,

184
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
for every creature of God is good,

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
and nothing to be refused

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,680
if it be received with thanksgiving,

187
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,080
for it is sanctified by the Word of God in prayer.

188
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,120
And I want you to notice,

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,880
so Paul is instructing,

190
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,240
he's giving Timothy really a warning here

191
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,960
and an understanding of what's going to happen.

192
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,280
And then notice the charge

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,960
that is issued in verse 6.

194
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,360
If thou, Timothy,

195
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,080
if thou put the brethren

196
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,320
in remembrance of these things,

197
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,600
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,

198
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,080
nourished up in the words of faith

199
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
and of good doctrine,

200
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
whereunto thou hast attained.

201
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,160
In the book of Titus,

202
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,680
you turn over just a few pages,

203
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,320
and you find in the book of Titus,

204
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,480
again, Paul will refer to Titus

205
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,240
as being a son in the faith,

206
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,160
and we find that Titus again

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,720
is given this responsibility

208
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,080
to go into Crete,

209
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,640
and we find that as he would go there,

210
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
that he would set things in order

211
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,680
that were wanting.

212
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,560
He was to ordain elders in every city,

213
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,960
and Titus had a responsibility.

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,400
And Paul is seeking to instruct Titus

215
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,320
and to help Titus to understand.

216
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,920
And throughout the book of Titus,

217
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,080
you will find a number of references

218
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
to this terminology,

219
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
sound doctrine.

220
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
Sound doctrine.

221
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Understanding the truth of the Word of God.

222
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Notice what he says in Titus 1.

223
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,520
In v. 10.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
Let me read v. 9 with it.

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,120
"...holding fast the faithful word

226
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
as he hath been taught,

227
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,360
that he may be able by sound doctrine

228
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,360
both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

229
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,760
For there are many unruly

230
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,400
and vain talkers and deceivers,

231
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,480
especially they of the circumcision."

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,240
That referring to the Jews,

233
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,920
we understand that terminology

234
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
throughout the New Testament.

235
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
And if you look and you understand

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,800
really contextually what's happening

237
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,880
throughout the New Testament era

238
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,440
and the propagating of the truth of the gospel,

239
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
remember in Acts 15,

240
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,560
they had to have a meeting,

241
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
a council at Jerusalem,

242
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,000
as it would be referred to.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,320
Why?

244
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,680
Because there were some Jewish people

245
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,440
that were saying to the Gentiles,

246
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,800
unless you're baptized,

247
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,320
excuse me, circumcised

248
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,520
after the manner of Moses,

249
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,960
you cannot be saved.

250
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,800
Well, that's not true.

251
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,520
Paul deals with it extensively

252
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
in the book of Galatians.

253
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
And here we find that

254
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
as he's instructing Titus,

255
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,120
he's saying, listen,

256
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,040
there are going to be people that come

257
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,960
that are vain talkers and deceivers.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
What is Paul saying

259
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,120
to these believers in Colossae?

260
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,760
He's saying, listen,

261
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm writing to you,

262
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,440
lest any man should beguile you

263
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
with enticing words.

264
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,040
Peter says this in 2 Peter 2.

265
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,200
In 2 Peter 2 verses 1-3,

266
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I've referenced this portion of Scripture,

267
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
but we'll read all three verses

268
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,840
here this morning.

269
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,600
The Bible says this,

270
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
Peter says in verse number one

271
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,960
of 2 Peter 2,

272
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
but there were false prophets

273
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,320
also among the people,

274
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,360
even as there shall be

275
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,120
false teachers among you,

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,240
who privily shall bring in

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,760
damnable heresies,

278
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,280
even denying the Lord that bought them

279
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
and bring upon themselves

280
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
swift destruction.

281
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,000
And look at what it says in verse two.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,360
And many shall follow

283
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,640
their pernicious ways,

284
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
by reason of whom

285
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,200
the way of truth

286
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,640
shall be evil spoken of,

287
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,000
and through covetousness

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,920
shall they with feigned words

289
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,800
make merchandise of you

290
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,720
whose judgment now of a long time

291
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,760
lingereth not

292
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,480
and their damnation slumbereth not.

293
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
The feigned words are false words.

294
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,920
Here in Colossians 2,

295
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,080
he says with enticing words.

296
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,240
And we find that the Bible tells us

297
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
that many shall follow

298
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,480
their pernicious ways.

299
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,080
Listen, that's a sad reality.

300
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
These false teachers,

301
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,160
they gain a following.

302
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,400
Why? Through their false teaching,

303
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
through their enticing words,

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
through their speech

305
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
that is adapted to persuade.

306
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,080
Leading others into error.

307
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,240
And we find that Paul

308
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,640
is issuing this caution

309
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,560
to the believers in Colossae

310
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,760
that they would understand

311
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,040
that these false teachers

312
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,000
are among them.

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
It's one thing to understand

314
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
that there are false teachers among us,

315
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,200
but it's another thing to understand

316
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,240
how they operate.

317
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,480
And so Paul is seeking

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,560
to not simply announce

319
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,160
to the believers in Colossae

320
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,000
that there are false teachers,

321
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,680
but to take it a step further

322
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,360
and say here's how they operate.

323
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Here's what they're seeking to do.

324
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
They want to beguile you.

325
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
They want to deceive you

326
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
to use this deception

327
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,360
by false reasoning.

328
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Now, I don't like being deceived.

329
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,340
Do you?

330
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
Have you ever been deceived?

331
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,920
You've ever been lied to?

332
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,400
It bothers you.

333
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,920
I don't want to be lied to.

334
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
I don't want to be deceived.

335
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,240
We find that they will,

336
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,000
these false teachers,

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,040
their seeking,

338
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,720
their goal is to beguile you.

339
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,160
Can you see the contrast

340
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
between what Paul said

341
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,560
to the believers in Colossae

342
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,600
in chapter 1?

343
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,440
What was the goal of his ministry?

344
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,160
To present you perfect

345
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,360
in Christ Jesus.

346
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
You couldn't be more opposite.

347
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Paul says I'm preaching Christ.

348
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,320
I'm warning every man.

349
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm teaching every man

350
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,760
so that we might present every man

351
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,520
perfect in Christ Jesus.

352
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,640
But these false teachers,

353
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,000
they're seeking to beguile you.

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,600
To deceive you by error.

355
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,320
By false reasoning.

356
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
We find that it's so important

357
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,880
that the people of God today,

358
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,240
we need wisdom

359
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,520
and we need discernment.

360
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,840
Oh, how we need discernment.

361
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Paul says this,

362
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,360
I believe that the Apostle Paul

363
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,400
wrote the book of Hebrews

364
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,280
and in Hebrews 5,

365
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
you don't need to turn there,

366
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,080
but in verse number 14,

367
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
really we don't have the time

368
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,880
to look at verses 11 through 14,

369
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,560
but we find that they were not growing

370
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
as they should be growing.

371
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
They should have been teachers,

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,800
but the Bible says

373
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,320
they were dull of hearing.

374
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
And here's what Paul says

375
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,320
in Hebrews 5 in verse number 14,

376
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,480
but strong me belongeth to them

377
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,440
that are of full age,

378
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
even those who by reason of use

379
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,800
have their senses exercised

380
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,720
to discern both good and evil.

381
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
You understand this morning

382
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,600
that a false teacher

383
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
doesn't show up on your doorstep.

384
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,080
A false teacher doesn't

385
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,360
come sit at your table.

386
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,320
A false teacher doesn't

387
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,120
come through the doors

388
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,600
of this congregation and say,

389
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,560
just so everyone knows

390
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
I'm a false teacher.

391
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,559
I mean, it'd be really easy

392
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
if they did that.

393
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,600
Just so you know,

394
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
I'm here to beguile you.

395
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,200
No, they don't do that.

396
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,119
They don't do that.

397
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,160
That's not how they operate.

398
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,400
And we need discernment.

399
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh, how we need discernment.

400
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,920
This morning as we think

401
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
about the passage of Scripture

402
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,800
and we speak about the way

403
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,840
in which it's relative

404
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,960
in our world today,

405
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
we're dealing with false teachers today

406
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
that are so prevalent.

407
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,679
We made the statement last week,

408
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,480
I made the statement

409
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,920
that we think about false teachers

410
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,280
that they are persistent

411
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,280
and they are persuasive.

412
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,960
And they are.

413
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,920
That's how they work.

414
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,520
They'll keep,

415
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,679
if they see that

416
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,440
there's an opportunity,

417
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,400
if they see that

418
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,840
there's some progress

419
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,520
that they have been able to make,

420
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,200
they're going to be persistent.

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
And oh, how they're persuasive.

422
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,160
And Paul says, I want to caution you.

423
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,480
It's interesting.

424
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,119
They'll change words.

425
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,200
We've mentioned before

426
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,440
how that they will use our vocabulary,

427
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,640
but not our dictionary.

428
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,200
They'll use a terminology

429
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
that perhaps we're familiar with,

430
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,679
but they mean something

431
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,800
entirely different.

432
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,360
It's important that we ask the question,

433
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,480
what do you mean by that?

434
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,760
Someone I gave a gospel track

435
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,040
to just recently,

436
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,840
and they said,

437
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,200
oh, I'm a Christian.

438
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,640
What does that mean?

439
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
How did you become a Christian?

440
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
Can you explain that?

441
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,740
that to me? Because the reality is that it's easy to say I'm a Christian. What

442
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,320
does it mean? Has there been a time in your life that you were born again, that

443
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
you recognize you're a sinner and needed the Savior, and that Jesus is the only

444
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Savior? Have you been born again? You understand. I gave a gospel tract to

445
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:26,100
someone yesterday. He said, Catholic? No, sir. A follower of Jesus Christ. And he

446
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:33,300
said, oh. But the reality is that they'll use our vocabulary, a different

447
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,460
dictionary, but then they'll do this. They'll change this book. They will

448
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,060
change this book. This book is authoritative. This is the Word of God,

449
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:52,560
and it is this book that must alter the behavior and the belief of any child of

450
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,160
God. We do not come up with our own ideas, with our own thoughts, and say, well,

451
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,960
we'll just change the Bible. No, no. It doesn't work that way. The Bible changes

452
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,280
us. Amen? Because the Bible is the Word of God for all scriptures given by

453
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,040
inspiration of God. It's not for me to change it. It's not for me to alter it.

454
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,760
It's not for me to say, well, it really doesn't mean this, or it doesn't mean

455
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,880
that. Listen, if somebody has to start being real creative in their explanation

456
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,600
of the Word of God, I'd be careful. The plain sense of the text of Scripture,

457
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,440
that's why it's important to, and you'll see through some of you that have been

458
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,480
here for the the duration of me pastoring here, some that are newer, I

459
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:43,240
preach expository messages almost extensively only. Why? Because we want to

460
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,480
get the Word of God in context. I'm trying to cherry-pick a verse from here

461
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,360
and there and make it say something that it really doesn't say. He cautions

462
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,320
them. I want you to notice, not only back in Colossians 2 do we find that Paul

463
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,000
cautions them, but I want you to know how Paul commends them. In verse number 5, we

464
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,360
find that Paul is extending to them this commendation. He is commending them, and

465
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,040
it's interesting. He begins by saying this in verse number 5,

466
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,120
For though I be absent in the flesh, we understand, we've made it clear

467
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,280
throughout our study of the book of Colossians, that Paul has never met these

468
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,280
people in the flesh. They've never met him. He heard about these believers

469
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,680
through Epaphras. The Bible reveals that to us in chapter number 1. We know that

470
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,440
there was a relationship between Paul and Epaphras, and we find that Epaphras

471
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,360
was the spiritual leader at the church at Colossae, and it was through this man

472
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,520
that Paul understands the things that are taking place in Colossae. This man

473
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,400
brought back a report. You'll remember in the book of 1 Thessalonians that Paul

474
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,000
shares with the believers in Thessalonica how that he couldn't go

475
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
back to Thessalonica. He administered there for a period of time, but he had to

476
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,320
depart, and he wanted to know their estate, so he sent Timothy, and he sends

477
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,920
Timothy to Thessalonica to get an update, to get a report of how they're doing, and

478
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,600
Timothy brings that back. That's how Paul understood things that were going on

479
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,240
there in Thessalonica. In Colossae, he understands these things through

480
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,680
Epaphras, and he says, though we're separated by distance, I've not seen you,

481
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm absent in the flesh, notice what he says, yet am I with you in the Spirit.

482
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,920
Then notice this next word in verse number 5, joying, joying, and beholding

483
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,920
your order, though he was separated from these believers by distance, yet he is

484
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,920
joying. The word means to rejoice greatly. Now, can you see Paul? He's in prison,

485
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,160
right? He's writing the book of Colossians from prison, and when he hears

486
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,440
about these believers in Colossae, when he receives this report from Epaphras,

487
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,640
and he hears about what's going on, and as he's praying for them, remember he

488
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,200
says in chapter 1, I'm praying for you always. He's praying, and he's thanking

489
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,800
God for them, and he's praying they would understand the truth, and he's seeking

490
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,040
the minister, and as he's writing this letter that we refer to as the book of

491
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,840
Colossians, he says that he's joying. I wish in my mind's eye I can see it, but I

492
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,600
wish, oh, how wonderful it would be to see the spirit of Paul in that prison cell.

493
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,040
He's rejoicing greatly. Paul, you're in prison. Yeah, but I'm thinking about those

494
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,880
believers over in Colossae, and oh, how excited he was to hear, oh, he was

495
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,920
troubled by the false teachers that were active, but he was excited about the

496
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,280
report that he received, and he says this, that he was beholding your order. It's

497
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,840
really the first reason, if you will, for which Paul was joying, that he was

498
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,000
rejoicing greatly, and he says he's beholding your order. The idea of this

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,760
phraseology really is a military idea. It really carries with it the idea of an

500
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,360
orderly and organized army. Now think about that. We sing songs about the Lord's

501
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,800
army, a Christian soldier. We understand that Paul says, and as he's writing again

502
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,640
to Timothy in 2nd Timothy chapter number 2, that to be a good soldier of

503
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,520
Jesus Christ, and Paul is looking at this church in Colossae through his

504
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,400
spiritual understanding and that which Epaphras has brought to him, and he

505
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,440
says, I'm beholding your order. You're like an organized army. I like the

506
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,000
imagery. I like the use of the words and the understanding within the context of

507
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,760
the language, and they would have understood exactly what it was that Paul

508
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,680
was sharing with them. He says not only am I beholding your order, but he says

509
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:59,680
this at the end of verse number 5, and the steadfastness of your faith in

510
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:07,560
Christ. By the way, your faith is only as good as the object of your faith. He says

511
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,480
the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. I spoke with someone this week

512
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,240
extensively, and I spoke to them about salvation being by grace through faith,

513
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,920
and he said, well I have faith, and I said, I understand that you have faith, but

514
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,880
what is your faith in? He began to give me an answer, and I said, listen, your faith

515
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,360
is only as good as the object of your faith. Who's your faith in? He says the

516
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,760
steadfastness of your faith in Christ. The word steadfastness carries with it

517
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,920
the idea of firmness. As believers, we're to have the steadfastness of our faith

518
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,240
in Christ, that we understand that Jesus gave the instruction to the

519
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,080
disciples before he ascended to heaven, not only to go and preach the gospel to

520
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,440
every creature, baptize them, and to teach them all things whatsoever I have

521
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,480
commanded you, and that we would have this steadfastness. When you think about

522
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,720
faith, really the idea here, the body of doctrine and truth by which we hold dear

523
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,520
as the people of God. Jude commends those that he's writing to, that

524
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,800
they are to contend for the faith. So Paul, as he has received this report

525
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,920
from these, or from Epaphras with regard to these believers in Colossae, he really

526
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,760
likens these believers to an orderly army of disciplined soldiers that are

527
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,920
making a solid front against the enemy. I like the imagery. You think about the

528
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:47,080
Roman soldiers, and the Roman Empire, and the advancement, and really the

529
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,320
understanding that these people would have had about that Roman army, and how

530
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,440
they would enter into battle. Listen, if you're gonna go into battle, you don't go

531
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
in all kind of confused, and man, some people are going over there, and some over here,

532
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,960
and some over here, and we're all disorderly. Man, that's a recipe

533
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,600
for disaster. Remember, as we studied last week in the first few verses of

534
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,480
Colossians chapter number two, he spoke about the fact that they would be knit

535
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,880
together in love, and we spoke about unity. Endeavoring to keep the unity of

536
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,320
the Spirit is what he says to the believers in Ephesus, and we find that

537
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,720
Paul is saying, I am rejoicing greatly, and he issues to these

538
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:38,120
believers, he commends them for their order, and for their steadfastness, or the

539
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,440
steadfastness of their faith in Christ. We find that he cautions them, we note

540
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,640
that he commends them, and then number three this morning, we note how Paul

541
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,280
challenges them. Here's the wonderful thing, as though Paul was rejoicing

542
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,400
because of their order, and their steadfastness, or the steadfastness of

543
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,400
their faith in Christ, Paul understood that he had to issue this challenge, that

544
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,400
they did not get comfortable where they were, that they did not just sit by

545
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,360
and stagnate. See, the reality is that in the Christian life, we must continue to

546
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:22,840
march forward. We need to be careful about becoming apathetic, indifferent.

547
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,280
Apathy is so dangerous. We can come to a place where we feel like I've kind of

548
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,960
gone as far as I think I need to go. Oh, beware. Be careful. It's interesting, in

549
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,520
like fashion, Paul extends a challenge to the believers in Thessalonica when he's

550
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,520
speaking to them about brotherly love, and he says, I know that you do it, but

551
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm challenging you to abound more and more. Don't get comfortable. Press on.

552
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,920
Hebrews 6 has the idea, you don't need to turn there, but in Hebrews chapter number

553
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,360
six, right after we read that passage in chapter number five about their dull of

554
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,440
hearing in the

555
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,240
There's a need for them to grow in their faith,

556
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,480
in their walk with God.

557
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,520
He tells them, let us go on

558
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,680
unto perfection.

559
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Remember, Paul is seeking

560
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,160
through the teaching of the Word of God

561
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,280
to present these believers perfect

562
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,160
in Christ Jesus.

563
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,240
And so how does Paul challenge

564
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,720
these believers in Colossae?

565
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,480
How is it that Colossians 2

566
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,640
would challenge me,

567
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,760
would challenge you this morning

568
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,120
in verses 6 and 7?

569
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,560
What is the challenge for us?

570
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,120
We receive the caution.

571
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
We understand there are false teachers around.

572
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,560
Listen, they're prevalent.

573
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,440
I've been dealing with things

574
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,040
in recent weeks

575
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,120
that are so very relevant

576
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,920
to this subject of false teachers.

577
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,520
It's prevalent in our day.

578
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,560
We need to be cautioned.

579
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,720
Oh, it's good that we have the Bible.

580
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,320
It's good that you're in church.

581
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,520
It's good that you have sought

582
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
to grow spiritually.

583
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,600
But we find this challenge

584
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,360
that is being issued to these believers,

585
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
and I believe to us this morning as well,

586
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,680
notice when he issues this challenge,

587
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,400
it's regarding their walk in v. 6.

588
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,320
As ye have therefore received

589
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Christ Jesus the Lord,

590
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,080
so walk ye in Him.

591
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,240
It's interesting as you look at the truth

592
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,480
in the book of Galatians

593
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,280
and you understand how those people

594
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,320
were led astray.

595
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,680
And you can read through it

596
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,720
in Galatians 1.

597
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,760
And they began in the faith

598
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
and they're going to continue in the flesh.

599
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,320
And Paul is really issuing

600
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,120
this state of confusion, if you will.

601
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,720
How is it that you begin this way

602
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,520
and then you try to go on this way?

603
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,000
And we find that Paul is saying

604
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,920
to these believers,

605
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,240
and the Word of God is saying to us this morning,

606
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,640
as ye have therefore received

607
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
Christ Jesus the Lord,

608
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,920
this morning, if you've been born again,

609
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,520
you've trusted Jesus Christ

610
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,840
as your personal Savior,

611
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,600
if I were to ask you this morning,

612
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,040
are you 100% sure

613
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,840
that heaven is your home?

614
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,440
I asked a man that question this week

615
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,080
and he said, if you put it that way,

616
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,760
I mean, he kind of did that number.

617
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,320
And I said, well, I'm not interested

618
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,920
in knowing if you're 95% sure.

619
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,480
It's not good enough.

620
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,640
Well, how could anyone know?

621
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm glad you asked.

622
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,760
Let me show you what the Word of God says.

623
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,320
We find, look, there's a stink bug, man.

624
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,880
I saw all you guys looking at it

625
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,120
and it got my attention, amen.

626
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,440
As long as that thing stays there,

627
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Juliana will be happy.

628
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,040
But if that thing goes down there,

629
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,880
you guys are in for a treat, amen.

630
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,040
And as you have therefore received

631
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
Christ Jesus the Lord,

632
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,720
if you've been saved,

633
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,200
you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

634
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
notice what Paul says,

635
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,080
so walk ye in him.

636
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,640
This truth of having a walk with the Lord,

637
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,760
this truth of having communion with the Lord,

638
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,880
what a blessing.

639
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,680
And what a unique opportunity that we have

640
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,720
to walk with God, to commune with Him.

641
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,520
I don't know how many of you

642
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
are reading the daily devotional

643
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
that we distributed to you this year,

644
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,800
but we distributed a daily devotional.

645
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,680
If you didn't get it and you want one,

646
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,640
we have plenty of other copies,

647
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,080
but it's called A Daily Word.

648
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,800
And if you read the devotional thought

649
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,720
from Friday evening,

650
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,040
it went through and it went through

651
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,640
all of these things that you're going to do

652
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,160
in your lifetime if you add all the minutes together.

653
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Did anyone read it?

654
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Okay, some of you read it.

655
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,120
And it's kind of interesting.

656
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,960
It was March 5th.

657
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,760
I'm going to go ahead and just read some of it.

658
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,120
And here's what it talks about.

659
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,800
It says this,

660
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,240
the average American will spend six months

661
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
sitting at stoplights.

662
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,560
And Julianna and Brianna said, what?

663
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,440
Every minute they add up, right?

664
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,240
And you go through and you look through

665
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,280
and it talks about five years waiting in line.

666
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,120
And I said, yep,

667
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
that's probably going to be a little bit longer for me

668
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,880
because I always find the long lines to wait in.

669
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
And you ever do that at the grocery store?

670
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,240
You think, man, there's only one person here.

671
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
We're in shape.

672
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,480
And then they're like, no, I don't want that.

673
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,400
And I don't want this.

674
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
And I think I'm, yeah.

675
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,320
And then it says that you're going to spend one year

676
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,920
looking for misplaced objects.

677
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,200
Some of you say, no, that's very underestimated, right?

678
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm going to spend a lot more than one year

679
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,040
looking for misplaced objects.

680
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
But anyway, it goes on.

681
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
It says this, you're going to eat.

682
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,240
You're going to spend six years eating.

683
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,600
Yeah, I like that.

684
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,680
You had all those minutes up.

685
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,360
But then it says this,

686
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,720
what would the number be if you added up all the time

687
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,000
you have spent with God so far in your life?

688
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,520
If you didn't read it, I'd recommend you read it.

689
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,880
Honestly, it's convicting.

690
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,920
How long do you spend with God?

691
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,960
We spend all this time doing all these other things.

692
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,240
And here's what the excuse is that most people use.

693
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,360
I just don't have time.

694
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,400
You have the same amount of minutes today

695
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,560
that anybody else living has.

696
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,760
It's how we use our time.

697
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,840
It's how we use our time.

698
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,520
And the reality, and I'm not sure of the study

699
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,800
that was behind all of that,

700
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
but I know that there are several things you can Google

701
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,000
and see how many minutes the average person per day

702
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,680
spends on this and the average lifespan,

703
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
and just calculate it out.

704
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I think it said six years eating,

705
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,600
and we calculated as a family last night

706
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,160
that if you spent one hour with God a day for 50 years,

707
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,720
it would equate to two years.

708
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,880
So we're gonna spend four times, three times, excuse me,

709
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,640
as more time eating than we are walking with God,

710
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
if you spend an hour a day.

711
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,960
Can I tell you this morning,

712
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,920
most people don't spend an hour a day with God.

713
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
We just don't.

714
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,720
And what I'm saying is that he says here,

715
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,000
as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,

716
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,880
so walk ye in him.

717
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,360
Continue this, listen, salvation is more

718
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,520
than just a fire insurance policy.

719
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,080
It's more than just keeping you out of the lake of fire.

720
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,280
We get to commune with the God of the universe.

721
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,720
We get to walk with him.

722
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,880
Jesus says this in John chapter number 10,

723
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,920
I've come to give you life

724
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,640
and that you might have it more abundantly.

725
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
Man, the abundant life in Christ,

726
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,680
it comes through our fellowship and our walk with him.

727
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,040
And as we walk with him, guess what?

728
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,040
We're less likely to be beguiled with enticing words.

729
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,320
Why?

730
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,040
Because I'm walking with him.

731
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,720
If somebody brings something and says,

732
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,960
well, this, that, and the other thing,

733
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,400
it's like, well, actually the Bible says right over here.

734
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,800
Let me share this with you.

735
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,440
Somebody asked me this week,

736
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,320
is that just something that you assume

737
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,640
or is that really what the Bible says?

738
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
That's a great question, by the way.

739
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
It's a valid question.

740
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,480
Because the reality is that we say

741
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,520
that the Word of God is the sole authority

742
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,080
for faith and practice.

743
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,160
So if you believe something and you say something,

744
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,320
you better have some Scriptures to back it up.

745
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
And if you have some Scriptures to back it up,

746
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,880
don't listen to what some false teacher says.

747
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,280
He challenges them with regard to their walk.

748
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Listen, if you're saved,

749
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,000
if you've received Christ Jesus the Lord,

750
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,080
so walk ye in Him.

751
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,240
Notice verse number seven, regarding their growth.

752
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,680
We understand the two are related one to the other.

753
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,200
He says in verse number seven,

754
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,520
rooted and built up in Him,

755
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,280
and established in the faith.

756
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,480
Let's look at these three references

757
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,360
and uses of these words that Paul uses.

758
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,160
Number one, he references really an agricultural type

759
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,640
of a word when he says rooted.

760
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Rooted.

761
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,680
Rooted in Christ.

762
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
You think about a plant that is rooted.

763
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,720
Have you ever tried to get some weeds out of the garden?

764
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,880
And man, those things got a root this long

765
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
and you say, what in the world?

766
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,840
We're rooted in Christ.

767
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,000
Here's the question, are we a mighty oak?

768
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,120
Or a tumbleweed?

769
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,080
How many of you know what tumbleweed is?

770
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,680
How many of y'all have driven in the West Coast

771
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,600
and you've seen tumbleweed?

772
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,760
Driving in the state of Nevada,

773
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,600
very limited number of people in the state of Nevada.

774
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
Little pockets of people all over,

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,160
but you could literally,

776
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,600
we have spent time when I lived in Nevada,

777
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,440
I could drive for three or four hours

778
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,160
and never see another human being.

779
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,040
You can't do that.

780
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,840
You can't drive three or four seconds in Northern Virginia.

781
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,120
Amen?

782
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm being serious.

783
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,720
You can drive hours.

784
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,280
I mean, if you break down, you're in trouble, man.

785
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,640
It's a desolate place.

786
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,400
You had to be more careful of the farmers

787
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
that had their fence break that the cow

788
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,880
was on the middle of the road.

789
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,360
Or the tumbleweed that would regularly blow out

790
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,120
in the middle of the road.

791
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,320
You're driving 70, 75 miles an hour

792
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,120
and those tumbleweed come blowing across the road.

793
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,600
It's a dangerous situation.

794
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,040
Why do they blow around so easily?

795
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
They're not rooted.

796
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
They're not rooted.

797
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,600
And so Paul uses this agricultural analogy, if you will,

798
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,880
and he says that we're to be rooted in Christ.

799
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,320
And then he uses an architectural analogy

800
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,480
when he says built up.

801
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,720
So you think about this being rooted in Christ,

802
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,400
being firm, having the idea of being thoroughly grounded.

803
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,880
Remember, the Bible says this

804
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,640
in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

805
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,160
when the word of God talks about the scriptures

806
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,280
being given by inspiration of God,

807
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,680
that they're profitable for doctrine, for reproof,

808
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,440
for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

809
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,440
that the man of God may be perfect, throughly firm.

810
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,520
unto all good works.

811
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,880
We find that if you were to read Psalm 1,

812
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,140
and you read about the blessed man,

813
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,420
that's a picture of someone that is grounded.

814
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,760
And he's firm.

815
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,040
And then he uses this architectural analogy

816
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,400
of being built up.

817
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,720
This idea of a constant increase

818
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
in Christian knowledge.

819
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,460
The fact that we're continuing to build

820
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,960
upon the teaching of the Word of God.

821
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,200
Not looking for other teaching.

822
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,480
Not looking for some kind of new teaching.

823
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,200
But seeking to know this book.

824
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,920
You know, if you read your Bible today,

825
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,440
and you read that same passage of Scripture

826
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,320
a month ago, a year ago, a couple of years ago,

827
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,920
God probably used that passage today

828
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,680
in your life different than He did before.

829
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Is it because it's a different passage?

830
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,960
No. It's because you have different circumstances today

831
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
than you did the last time you read it.

832
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,920
And God will reveal something to you

833
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,280
in that passage that perhaps you had not seen before.

834
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,800
As a pastor, as a preacher of the Word of God,

835
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,680
I preach multiple times a week.

836
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm talking to people all the time.

837
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,000
And there are times that I will preach a message

838
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,560
from a passage of Scripture,

839
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,480
and later that week, I will in my personal devotions

840
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,240
read that same passage of Scripture

841
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,080
and say, man, I wish I had seen that

842
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,800
before I preached.

843
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,520
Because that was really good.

844
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,760
Why didn't I see that?

845
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,200
It's a living book.

846
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,560
And we just continue to build up.

847
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,160
He says rooted.

848
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,080
That agricultural analogy

849
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,640
of being rooted in Christ.

850
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,040
That firmness being thoroughly grounded.

851
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
The idea of being built up.

852
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,200
The architectural analogy

853
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,240
of a constant increase in Christian knowledge.

854
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,560
And then He says established.

855
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,840
Notice back in Colossians 2 and verse 7.

856
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,120
Rooted and built up in Him.

857
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,280
We've said in Christ.

858
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,840
We understand that Him is referring to Christ.

859
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,440
We understand that contextually.

860
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
And so we want to be rooted and built up in Christ.

861
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,480
And then He says established in the faith.

862
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
Established.

863
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Make firm.

864
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Having something that is established.

865
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,120
It's not gonna waver.

866
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,840
It's not gonna change.

867
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,480
You understand today that our world is changing?

868
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,320
Amen?

869
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,680
It's changing so much,

870
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,080
they don't even know what's going on.

871
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,520
I'm being honest.

872
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,880
Our world has lost its mind.

873
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,240
That's what happens when you get rid of truth.

874
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,480
When you set truth aside, anything goes.

875
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,800
The cancel culture that we're living in,

876
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,880
those people that are canceling somebody else today,

877
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,680
they're gonna be canceled tomorrow.

878
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,520
It's all relativism.

879
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,760
But we got this book.

880
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,840
That's truth.

881
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,280
And we're established in it.

882
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,160
Listen, I'm not mad at somebody

883
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,400
because they disagree with what I believe.

884
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,280
I'm really not.

885
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,920
But I'm not gonna be swayed to believe what they believe

886
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,720
just because there's some pressure.

887
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,920
Because I wanna please Christ.

888
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,440
I wanna please God.

889
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,160
And so we have to be established.

890
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,960
Established in the faith.

891
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,120
Look at what He says.

892
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,080
As ye have been taught.

893
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,040
As ye have been taught.

894
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
And I believe that's important.

895
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,920
We go back to Colossians one and we dealt with this

896
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,920
on our very first message on the book of Colossians

897
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,320
when he, Paul, is addressing these believers

898
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,400
and he's speaking about how they were giving thanks

899
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
and rejoicing for them, praying for them.

900
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,680
He says in verse number seven,

901
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,680
as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow servant,

902
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,440
who is for you a faithful minister of Christ.

903
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,920
These people in Colossae, these believers,

904
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,040
they had been taught.

905
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,840
And Paul says, as he's writing to them

906
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,320
and he's challenging them with regard to their walk,

907
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,760
with regard to their growth,

908
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,320
he says being rooted and built up in him,

909
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,000
established in the faith as ye have been taught.

910
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,560
Don't go looking for some other sources.

911
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,320
You've been taught by a good minister, a faithful minister.

912
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,200
And therefore, listen, I know I dealt with this

913
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,720
so I don't wanna repeat all of it,

914
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,400
but what's a faithful minister?

915
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,840
What's a good minister?

916
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,400
Someone that teaches the book.

917
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,960
Feed the flock of God,

918
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,600
that's the responsibility of the pastor,

919
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,400
the truth in 1 Peter chapter number five.

920
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,200
And we desire in our church through the ministry

921
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,440
that God has given me to teach the word of God.

922
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,080
Not my opinions, not my ideas,

923
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,000
but to teach the word of God, to teach the truth.

924
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,920
And we find that he says, as ye have been taught,

925
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,200
notice this truth in 2 Timothy chapter number two.

926
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,840
We used to have these words on our hallway

927
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,200
as you would walk down the stairs

928
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,840
to the Sunday school classrooms.

929
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,800
We painted and therefore those words are no longer there,

930
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,280
but we need to get those reprinted

931
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,000
so that we can put them on the wall again.

932
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,640
But in 2 Timothy chapter number two and verse number two,

933
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,360
the Bible says this, let me read verse number one with it.

934
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,960
Thou therefore my son,

935
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,920
be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

936
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,640
In the things that thou hast heard of me

937
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
among many witnesses,

938
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,920
notice these two words, the same, the same.

939
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,840
Commit thou to faithful men

940
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,160
who shall be able to teach others also.

941
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,720
The same, why?

942
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,120
Because truth doesn't change, right?

943
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,720
Paul says, I've given you this truth, Timothy.

944
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,680
I have given you the truth, I have taught you,

945
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,120
it's been among many witnesses

946
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,320
and you now, Timothy, take the same,

947
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,200
the same body of truth and teach others.

948
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,840
Again, as I mentioned earlier,

949
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,760
as we looked at 1 Timothy chapter number four,

950
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,360
Paul is, if you can think of it this way,

951
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,240
he's passing the baton.

952
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,040
In 2 Timothy chapter number four, Paul says,

953
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,140
look, the time of my departure is at hand.

954
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,600
So who's going to run the next leg of the race?

955
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,000
Paul says, Timothy, the same things that I've taught you,

956
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,720
the same, commit thou to faithful men

957
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,480
who shall be able to teach others also.

958
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,080
The truth of the Word of God.

959
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,520
The people in Colossae, the false teachers,

960
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,360
they were looking for some new truth.

961
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,080
There is no new truth.

962
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,560
We have the full canon of Scripture.

963
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,240
We have the whole Bible.

964
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,440
We're not looking for new revelation.

965
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,200
We just need to study the book that God's given us.

966
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,120
Amen?

967
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,880
People so busy looking for something new,

968
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,660
they haven't even read this.

969
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,520
Honestly.

970
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,360
Colossians chapter number two, notice what he says.

971
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,400
Think about this truth,

972
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,840
when he says, as you have been taught,

973
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,840
and then he says this, abounding therein.

974
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,140
Abounding therein.

975
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,120
With thanksgiving, this idea of abounding,

976
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,960
really you get this idea,

977
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,880
if I could use the analogy of maybe a river,

978
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,120
and abounding would not be a trickling stream,

979
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,640
but a mighty river.

980
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Abounding therein with thanksgiving.

981
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,860
So Paul, as he is going to challenge them,

982
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,360
he challenges them with regard to their walk,

983
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,200
with regard to their growth,

984
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,640
and with regard to their thanksgiving.

985
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,400
To their gratitude.

986
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,520
With regard to their gratitude.

987
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,840
He says, with thanksgiving.

988
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
You know, this morning, it would be helpful for us

989
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,800
as the people of God,

990
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,980
just as it would have been helpful

991
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,440
for these believers in Colossae,

992
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,020
to thank God for truth.

993
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,300
You know how blessed you are to have a Bible?

994
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,340
Honestly.

995
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,220
Really, I can't honestly say without thinking,

996
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,680
because oftentimes I think about it

997
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,500
just because of how I have understood

998
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,320
other parts of the world,

999
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,760
and have come to understand that.

1000
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,460
But most times, we will say,

1001
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,520
as a preacher of the word of God,

1002
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,760
take your Bibles and turn to.

1003
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,720
It's just kind of a habit kind of thing.

1004
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,560
Why?

1005
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,360
Well, number one, because I'm preaching from the Bible.

1006
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,120
I'm not just giving you my thoughts or ideas.

1007
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,420
Number two, because you have a Bible,

1008
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,840
and therefore you can turn to the Bible.

1009
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,800
There are people groups all across this globe

1010
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,440
that do not have the word of God.

1011
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,240
We send missionaries to places

1012
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,080
in which they do not have members of a congregation

1013
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,120
that have their own Bible

1014
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,820
that they can take home with them.

1015
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,680
All over the globe.

1016
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,540
But you have a Bible.

1017
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,180
Are you thankful for it?

1018
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,500
I mean, he says this in Colossians 2.

1019
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,700
He says, with thanksgiving,

1020
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,200
abounding therein with thanksgiving.

1021
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,620
Listen, we need to be thankful.

1022
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,820
We preach this passage of scripture in Hebrews 13

1023
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,020
at the end of last year about some 10 things to rejoice.

1024
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,300
It's a two-part series.

1025
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,060
One of those things was rejoicing,

1026
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,860
not only in truth, but rejoicing for spiritual leaders.

1027
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,180
Someone that would stand up and preach the Bible.

1028
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,020
We live in a time and a day and age

1029
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,300
that there's not a whole lot.

1030
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,860
I mean, there are people that are preaching.

1031
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,300
Thankfully, there are faithful preachers

1032
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,020
of the word of God.

1033
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,980
But you understand that you can find a lot of places

1034
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,940
around this country in America

1035
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,180
where you're hard-pressed to find a faithful church

1036
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,900
that preaches the word of God.

1037
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,260
That's sad.

1038
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,100
It's sad.

1039
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,860
So Paul is saying to these believers,

1040
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,700
how's your gratitude?

1041
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,180
Every day, are you thanking God for the spiritual blessings?

1042
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,740
Are you thanking Him because you have a Bible?

1043
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,020
Oh, how blessed we are to have the word of God,

1044
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,620
that I can go to the Bible.

1045
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,340
Listen, when you need direction,

1046
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,700
you seek the face of God through His word.

1047
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,300
It's a lamp unto our feet.

1048
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,340
It's the word of God that helps us to grow

1049
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,180
and be established.

1050
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,540
And so Paul says, listen,

1051
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,040
I want to caution you. I want you to understand not only are the false

1052
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:13,840
teachers active, but here's how they work. Here's how they operate. When you know

1053
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,960
how the false teacher operates, it gives you an advantage. It really does. To

1054
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,680
defend against it. To understand, what do I need to do? Okay, if they're active and

1055
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,400
this is how they operate, they're going to seek to

1056
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,100
beguile me with enticing words, therefore I must be rooted and I must be built up

1057
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,920
in Christ Jesus. Why? Because that's the defense. I'm not going to be beguiled. I'm

1058
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,960
not going to be deceived because I've been established in the faith. I have

1059
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,520
grown spiritually. So after he he cautions them, he commends them, and then

1060
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,320
he challenges them. For us this morning, I wonder how is our how's our walk with

1061
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:04,200
God? As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. If we're

1062
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:14,040
to add up all the time in this last week, in this last month, in 2021, that we've

1063
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:21,440
spent with God, how many hours would it equal? That's not a question that I want

1064
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:28,960
you to answer me. I want you to ask yourself, how's my walk with God? Are we

1065
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,400
growing spiritually? I'll say this, if you're not walking with God, your

1066
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,640
spiritual growth probably isn't that great because our spiritual growth is

1067
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:47,640
the the outflow, the result of our walk with him. Are we growing? Are we thankful?

1068
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:55,880
Thankful for truth. Thankful that God would, I mean, the privilege that is ours

1069
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:03,560
to have the truth. What a joy. It comes with great responsibility. But this

1070
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,360
morning, I hope that as we look at this passage and we see how Paul was

1071
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,240
addressing these believers in Colossae, that we would find that it's for us

1072
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,880
today in 2021. It's for you. It's for me. That we would receive the word of caution.

1073
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,600
Oh, it's good to receive commendation, but let's not get stuck on the

1074
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,320
commendation. Let's look at the challenge as well, that we continue to grow, to

1075
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,040
develop in our walk with Christ. Because the false teachers, they're active.

1076
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,840
They're active. And they're seeking to beguile you, to deceive you. So they're

1077
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:50,480
seeking to do. You say, no, absolutely. Satan doesn't want you to serve God. And

1078
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,520
if you're saved this morning, he'll do everything he can to keep you from

1079
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,960
serving God. If you're lost, you've never trusted Christ as your Savior, he'll

1080
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,000
bring plenty of false teachers into your life to keep you from trusting Christ.

1081
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,800
How do we know that? 2 Corinthians 4. The God of this world has blinded the

1082
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,720
minds of them that would believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel

1083
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,800
should shine in unto them. How does he do that? False teaching. It's what he does.

1084
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,520
It's how he operates. I'm so thankful for the Word of God. I hope this morning that

1085
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,480
we'd receive a challenge just as these believers in Colossae received. Shall we

1086
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,360
pray? Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the truth

1087
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,940
that you've given us and thy word for this portion of Scripture and how

1088
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:36,640
applicable it is in our lives even today. Oh, how mindful I am of the help that

1089
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,880
these believers in Colossae must have received as they were reading and

1090
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,000
digesting the truth contained within this book of Colossians. I pray this

1091
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,520
morning that you would help us. Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I

1092
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,360
pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's

1093
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:03,520
righteousness, of judgment to come. Lord, I pray for each believer. Would you help

1094
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:09,120
us to walk with you? Help us, God, to grow, to be rooted and grounded in Christ,

1095
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:18,600
rooted and built up in Christ. I pray, Father, that you would help us to be

1096
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:27,600
prepared individually and corporately as a church to contend for the faith,

1097
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:34,320
understanding that the best defense for false teaching is spiritual growth, that

1098
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,040
we would, as Paul said of these believers in Colossae, he says, beholding your order,

1099
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:47,040
steadfastness of your faith in Christ, that we too would be like that organized

1100
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,600
army, setting a firm defense against the attack of the enemy and the false

1101
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:58,440
teaching that is so prevalent today. Help us, God. Work in lives, have your

1102
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,780
will and way, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

1103
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,680
are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano, and as

1104
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,640
she does, the altar is open. I'm gonna come and pray down here at this altar.

1105
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,360
You want to pray in your seat? Would you let the Lord have his way

1106
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,800
in your life today? If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and

1107
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,400
show you, like, you know for sure that heaven is your home. Maybe you need to

1108
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,280
grow, maybe you'd be honest with the Lord about your walk, and you say, Lord I

1109
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:32,240
need, I need to grow. I need to walk with you. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
