1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
course finished up the 12th chapter a couple of weeks ago and we took a couple

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,119
of lessons to get through Genesis chapter number 12 and as we finished up

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,399
the latter part of Genesis chapter number 12 we had the opportunity to look

4
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:17,639
at verses 10 through 20 and as we looked at that passage of Scripture we found

5
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:21,659
that Abram of course had followed the direction of the Lord and had gone to

6
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,399
the promised land to the land of Canaan we refer to it as the promised land and

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,200
he arrived in the land of Canaan in the first section of Genesis chapter number

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,479
12 of course they had left the Ur of the Chaldees went to Haran and then down to

9
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,819
Canaan the Bible told us in Genesis chapter number 12 that there was a great

10
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:44,400
famine it was a grievous famine and Abram left with him and his wife and

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,720
all that they had lot in his all of the cattle all of the herds all that they

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,000
had and they went to Egypt and we found that the Scriptures told us in those 10

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,560
verses at the end of Genesis chapter number 12 how that Abram and all that he

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:03,680
had went down into Egypt and we made some interesting under just really

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,720
interesting truth that is given to us here in Genesis chapter number 12 with

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,839
regard to the demonstration of God's power and the ability for our God to

17
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:19,040
work through all situations and of course Abram sought to lean on his own

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
understanding and convince Sarah to say Sarah I at the time that she was his

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,879
sister and so on and so forth but God demonstrated his power and protect it

20
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:35,839
Sarah I and protected Abram and we find that our God is able amen and we don't

21
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:39,360
have to rely on our own understanding in fact the Bible tells us that we're to

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,839
trust in the Lord with all of our hearts that we're not to lean on our own

23
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:47,680
understanding and what a blessing it is when we see God work and when we have

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,239
the opportunity as we did at the end of Genesis chapter number 12 to see what

25
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,480
God is able to do I finished the passage by asking this question did we

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,879
learn a lesson I asked if Abram learned a lesson but we know that he repeats

27
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,599
the same mistake later on in the book of Genesis but I wonder this evening and I

28
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,440
asked the question two weeks ago did we learn a lesson did we learn that our God

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,320
is able I believe as I mentioned in that particular message that if Abram would

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,679
have walked right into Egypt and said yes she is my wife God would have

31
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:28,160
protected her because our God is able he didn't have to come up with some scheme

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,880
and devise some story and I understand that in his mind he justified it because

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,800
of the fact that he and and Sarah I were half sisters and so or half siblings and

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,199
so on and so forth but we understand that our God is able he is able to do we

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,119
understand as we have the New Testament principles in Ephesians 3 that he's able

36
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:50,520
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask her think that's the God

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,240
that we serve and we find that after the events unfold at the end of Genesis

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:04,360
chapter number 12 that Pharaoh says to to Abram in verse number 19 why sets now

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,679
she is my sister so I might have taken her to meet a wife now therefore behold

40
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:13,520
thy wife take her and go thy way and the Bible tells us that Pharaoh

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,279
commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all

42
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:21,839
that he had and we enter chapter 13 the fact the passage will be studying this

43
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:27,039
evening and the Bible says this and Abram went up out of Egypt he and his

44
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,919
wife and all that he had and a lot with him into the south and Abram was very

45
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,000
rich in cattle and silver and gold and he he went on his journeys from the

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,679
south even to Bethel under the place where his tent had been at the beginning

47
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:45,119
between Bethel and AI under the place of the altar which he had made there at

48
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:51,279
the first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord and lot also which went

49
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:56,039
with Abram had flocks and herds and tents the land was not able to bear them

50
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,160
that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,479
not dwell together notice in verse number eight if you will the Bible says

52
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:12,279
this and Abram said unto lot let there be no strife I pray thee between me and

53
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:19,200
thee between my herd men and thy herd men for we be brethren now I'd like to

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,079
preach a message this evening and really we're gonna look at the entirety of

55
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,480
Genesis 13 that I've simply entitled from verse number eight let there be no

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,679
strife let there be no strife as we look at the passage of Scripture and we see

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,880
how that Abram would now depart from Egypt he and his family and all that he

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,600
had you find that there in verse number one the Bible says that Abram went up

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,839
out of Egypt he and his wife notice this and all that he had and lot with him

60
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,679
notice in verse number two the Bible says that Abram was very rich in cattle

61
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:55,679
and silver and gold we found that in verse number 16 of Genesis 12 the Bible

62
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,320
told us that Pharaoh entreated Abram well for her sake and he Abram had sheep

63
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,959
and oxen and he asses and men servants and maidservants and she asses and

64
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,760
camels and we find that God had blessed Abram and as we consider the passage of

65
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,839
Scripture that is before us and we look at these first six verses if you're

66
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,559
taking notes I want you to notice with me his walk notice the walk of Abram I

67
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:23,679
want you to consider he had been in the land of Canaan he had been in the very

68
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,119
place where God had promised him to go and as he had gone to that place as he

69
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:33,359
arrived to the place where God had instructed them and led him to be he

70
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:38,000
endured difficulty there was a famine I said this is I was speaking to a

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,640
missionary friend just on a day or two after I preached the message two weeks

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,880
ago here from Genesis chapter number 12 I said the God of the universe I think I

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,399
mentioned it during the message as well but the God of the universe he is

74
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,720
omniscient he is omnipotent we find that he knows all things he knows the end

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,119
from the beginning he is Alpha and Omega and we find that God Almighty had

76
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:08,119
directed Abram and his family to travel to arrive in this place when there would

77
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:17,440
be a famine no doubt in my mind that God could have led Abram to arrive when

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,519
there wasn't gonna be a famine no doubt in my mind that God because he's

79
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,320
omnipotent he has all power he could have prevented the famine but you

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,440
understand that he led him to arrive when there was gonna be a famine see God

81
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,720
he works in our lives to develop us to help us to trust him and to see what he's

82
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,440
able to do I think about the disciples and how that Jesus said to them get on

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,600
the ship and go across the sea knowing that they were going to encounter a

84
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,440
storm by the way he's the same God that could say peace be still and calm the

85
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,040
storm but yet he did not prevent the storm from happening he wanted to show

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,000
his power we find that Abram made the decision I mentioned it last time as we

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,220
looked at chapter number 12 he made that decision to depart the land that God had

88
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,200
led him to and because of that famine he goes down to Egypt and we find that he's

89
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,359
there throughout the scriptures we find that Egypt is a picture of the world and

90
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:29,720
we find that he Abram and his family and all that he had they go down to Egypt

91
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,480
and there he has the opportunity to see God work he was fearful that that his

92
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,399
life would be taken because of Sarai and her beauty and the fact that Pharaoh

93
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:47,000
would take her and yet it was that very Pharaoh that said here take your wife

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,720
and be gone we find that he now is going to journey back to the place where

95
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,920
God had originally led him to there in the place of Cain and we found all the

96
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,679
way back in Genesis chapter 3 11 how that God spoke to Abram and gave him

97
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:09,720
that direction to leave the earth the Cowdys they could not travel across the

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Arabian Desert for many reasons and so they had to go northwestward as they

99
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,959
would go to Haran and then they would leave her on and then go down to Canaan

100
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,000
and we find that now this man Abram and all that he has they're now going to

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,279
journey and the Bible tells us in verse number three as we think about his walk

102
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,679
and the Bible says that he went on his journey from the south even to Bethel

103
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:41,479
notice what it says unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning

104
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,640
between Bethel and Ai you notice that as we studied the 12th chapter then in

105
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,520
verse number eight that the Bible tells us that he removed this unto a mountain

106
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,359
on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and Ai on

107
00:08:56,359 --> 00:09:00,359
the east and there he built it an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name

108
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:05,359
of the Lord and we see the walk of Abram and we see as they would travel and

109
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:09,840
journey and now they're leaving that place they're leaving Egypt and they're

110
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,640
walking they're journeying back to that land of promise the land that God had

111
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,400
led them to we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four under the place

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,559
of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the

113
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,960
name of the Lord will come back to verse number four at the end of the message

114
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,559
and make reference there again but I want you to see what the Bible tells us

115
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,140
about lot here in verses five and six and about what's taking place the Bible

116
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,859
says this that the that law also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and

117
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:49,179
tents now we find that there was a level of blessing that God had poured out not

118
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:55,539
only upon Abram but upon law as well and we find that they were receiving and

119
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:02,140
enjoying the blessing of the Lord and the Bible tells us in verse number six

120
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,180
that the land was not able to bear them.

121
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,120
As we would think about the increase of possessions,

122
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
it led to a shortage of land.

123
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,640
And we find that the Bible tells us

124
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
that the land was not able to bear them,

125
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,100
that they might dwell together,

126
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,260
for their substance was great,

127
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,000
so that they could not dwell together.

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,620
I want you to just for a moment

129
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,100
consider as Abram would leave Egypt

130
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
and he's following the Lord

131
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,660
and going back to Canaan.

132
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,700
That's a good walk.

133
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,820
As you would walk back to the place

134
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,940
where God had initially led him

135
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,740
as God was giving him that direction.

136
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,620
Of course, we know that Stephen,

137
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,820
as he is preaching in Acts 7,

138
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
he makes note of Abram

139
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,340
and his entrance into the land of Canaan

140
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,860
and the dwelling there

141
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,180
and all of the blessing.

142
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,340
And so, we find that now Abram

143
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,220
is back in the place where he's supposed to be.

144
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,980
I'm so thankful that our God is gracious.

145
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm so thankful that we can walk with Him.

146
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,660
We spoke about Enoch this morning.

147
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
And we spoke about the fact

148
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,740
that he walked with God.

149
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,700
He pleased the Lord.

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,980
And we see that in Genesis 11

151
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,660
and verses 5 and 6.

152
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,580
And what a joy.

153
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,180
And now we see that Abram,

154
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,620
as he is walking back,

155
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,060
and I believe that during this journey,

156
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,860
no doubt there were some things

157
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,940
that he would contemplate.

158
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
There's some things that he's considering

159
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
as he's returning.

160
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,420
And he's experienced some blessings

161
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,460
and he's seeing the rich blessing

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,980
that the Lord poured upon him

163
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,300
and upon his nephew Lot.

164
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,780
We find not only his walk,

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,380
but I want you to notice number 2

166
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,460
in verses 7-13.

167
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,020
I want you to notice his wisdom.

168
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,540
Notice his wisdom.

169
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,860
In verse 7, the Bible tells us

170
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,900
that there was a strife

171
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
between the herdmen of Abram's cattle

172
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,460
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.

173
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,900
Now, we understand that as we look

174
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,380
at what's taking place here

175
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,340
and we see the cause of this strife

176
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,220
that's revealed to us in verse 6,

177
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,780
the Bible says that the land

178
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,980
was not able to bear them.

179
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,580
And we see that because of their increased goods

180
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,060
and substance that the land was insufficient

181
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,300
and we find that there's this problem

182
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,260
and it results in this strife

183
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,940
and the herdmen of Abram

184
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,220
and the herdmen of Lot,

185
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,420
they have this strife.

186
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,140
And notice what the Bible says

187
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,100
at the end of verse 7,

188
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,260
and the Canaanite and the Perizzite

189
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,940
dwelled then in the land.

190
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,420
Now, we will not take time

191
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,660
to develop all of it,

192
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,300
but we had discussed during the time

193
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,220
in which Noah would make his

194
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,340
prophetic statements how the Canaanites

195
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,260
would be the dwellers of that particular land,

196
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,300
and we see here that the Bible says

197
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,020
that the Canaanite and the Perizzite

198
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,740
dwelled then in the land.

199
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,260
There's a couple of observations

200
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,740
that I make from that statement of Scripture.

201
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,300
Number one is this,

202
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,180
that there are others that are living there.

203
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,780
I think about when Jesus told them

204
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,340
to get on the ship and the Bible says

205
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,460
that there were other little ships.

206
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,700
You know that you're not the only one

207
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,220
going through a storm in life.

208
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,940
Amen?

209
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,860
There were other little ships.

210
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
There were other ships on the sea.

211
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,100
There are other folks that are dealing

212
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,940
with difficulties,

213
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,300
and so there's other people in this land,

214
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,780
but one thing that I notice

215
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,620
is that the Canaanite and Perizzite,

216
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,260
these people groups that are mentioned,

217
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,700
they now are witnessing this strife

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,900
between the herdmen of Abram

219
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,500
and the herdmen of Lot.

220
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,580
Brethren, it ought not be

221
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,420
that the world would see the people of God

222
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,820
engaged in strife.

223
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,380
Amen?

224
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,060
And that's what we see that's happening.

225
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,740
We see that here,

226
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,860
as there's this strife that's taking place,

227
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,060
no doubt that Abram has a measure of wisdom

228
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,220
as we see as he begins to respond to Lot

229
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,340
and he gives them these options,

230
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,300
and we find it in verse 8

231
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,860
that Abram said unto Lot,

232
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,700
let there be no strife.

233
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,500
Let there be no strife, I pray Thee,

234
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,580
between me and Thee

235
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,180
and between my herdmen and Thy herdmen.

236
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,140
Notice what he says,

237
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,820
for we be brethren.

238
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,540
And we find that Abram,

239
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,220
as he would respond properly

240
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,460
to this problem that is here,

241
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,940
we understand in life

242
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,780
that there's no doubt

243
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,380
that we're going to face problems.

244
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,660
We're going to face difficulties and challenges.

245
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,380
Can I tell you that the enemy,

246
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,900
he seeks to cause division.

247
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,900
He seeks to set people at variance

248
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
one with another.

249
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,860
He seeks to divide

250
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,940
and to cause schisms within the body.

251
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,260
That's what the enemy wants to do.

252
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,620
And we find here that Abram responds

253
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,700
and he says,

254
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,180
let there be no strife, I pray Thee,

255
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,220
between me and Thee

256
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,420
and between my herdmen and Thy herdmen,

257
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,300
for we be brethren.

258
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,940
For we be brethren.

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,460
I notice that as we would look

260
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
at the response of Abram here

261
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,220
and we're noticing the wisdom of Abram

262
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,500
that we will understand

263
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,460
and easily recognize this evening

264
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,580
that if we're going to resolve

265
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
the problems that we face in life,

266
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,660
that we are going to need the wisdom of God.

267
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,900
And the thing that's wonderful

268
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,140
is that God says that He'll give us wisdom.

269
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,500
We can have His wisdom.

270
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,780
We don't have to rely upon our own

271
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,420
way of thinking and our own solutions to problems.

272
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,060
We can have the wisdom of God.

273
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,660
I want to keep your spot here,

274
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,700
but turn to the book of 1 Kings if you will

275
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,060
in chapter 3.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,420
And we're familiar with the passage of Scripture

277
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,260
here in 1 Kings 3

278
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,620
and what's taking place.

279
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,260
And you find that Solomon is now

280
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,420
the king of Israel

281
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,100
and he is now sitting and reigning

282
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,540
and his father David of course,

283
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,740
a great king,

284
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,780
and now Solomon,

285
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,180
the third king of the nation of Israel,

286
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,220
Saul, David, and now Solomon.

287
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,460
And he's reigning

288
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,580
and he's real early on here in his reign.

289
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,740
And the Bible tells us

290
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,580
that the Lord appears to him.

291
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,140
And as the Lord appears to him,

292
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
in verse 5 it says,

293
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,460
in Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon

294
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,700
in a dream by night

295
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,540
and God said,

296
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,940
ask what I shall give thee.

297
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,140
Can you imagine?

298
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,500
I was reading just recently

299
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,460
through the Gospel records

300
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,020
and how Herod said to ask what you want of me.

301
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,500
And of course, the whole situation

302
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
with the head of John the Baptist.

303
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,420
You think about Ahasuerus

304
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,220
when he says to Esther,

305
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,220
ask what you will up to the half of my kingdom.

306
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,300
And here, the God of the universe

307
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,300
appears to Solomon in this dream

308
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,660
and He says, ask what I shall give thee.

309
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,580
And we find that Solomon responds

310
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,220
in verse 6,

311
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,900
and Solomon said,

312
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,700
Thou hast showed unto Thy servant David,

313
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,540
my father, great mercy,

314
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,300
according as he walked before Thee

315
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,740
in truth and in righteousness

316
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,100
and in uprightness of heart with Thee.

317
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,660
And Thou hast kept for him

318
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,780
this great kindness

319
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,940
that Thou hast given him a son

320
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,180
to sit on his throne as it is this day.

321
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,540
Do you see in verse 6

322
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,580
the humility of Solomon?

323
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,860
The recognition of the goodness of God

324
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,420
in his life and the blessing

325
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,060
and the mercy that God has shown,

326
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,820
the favor that God has shown?

327
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
You see it in verse 6.

328
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,340
Notice as he continues in verse 7,

329
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,380
And now, O Lord my God,

330
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,260
Thou hast made Thy servant king

331
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,140
instead of David my father.

332
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,780
And I am but a little child.

333
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,020
I know not how to go out or come in.

334
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,900
And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people

335
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,340
which Thou hast chosen a great people

336
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,660
that cannot be numbered

337
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,180
nor counted for multitude.

338
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,660
Give therefore Thy servant

339
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,340
an understanding heart to judge Thy people

340
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,740
that I may discern between good and bad

341
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,860
for who is able to judge this

342
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Thy so great a people?

343
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,980
I love what the Bible tells us in verse 10.

344
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,700
And the speech pleased the Lord.

345
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,820
That Solomon had asked this thing.

346
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,500
Solomon said give me understanding.

347
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,140
Give me wisdom

348
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,620
to be able to lead and judge Thy people.

349
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,500
Notice the text of Scripture

350
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,020
in 1 Kings 3, beginning in verse 16.

351
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,820
We don't have time to deal with all of it,

352
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,220
but down through verse 28

353
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,540
is the first opportunity for Solomon

354
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,940
to display this wisdom

355
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,020
that God had supernaturally given him.

356
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,980
And we find that there's this situation

357
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,740
with a child that died in the night

358
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,100
and the one mother says,

359
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,380
no, the dead child's yours.

360
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,260
And the other one says, no, the dead child's yours.

361
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,580
And so on and so forth.

362
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,700
And the Bible says this in verse 22,

363
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,980
And the other woman said, nay,

364
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,100
but the living is my son

365
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,460
and the dead is thy son.

366
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
And this said, no.

367
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
But the dead is thy son

368
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,020
and the living is my son.

369
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,859
Thus they spake before the king.

370
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,380
Verse 23, Then said the king,

371
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,340
the one saith, this is my son that liveth

372
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,980
and thy son is the dead.

373
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,299
And the other saith, nay,

374
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,500
but thy son is the dead

375
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,059
and my son is the living.

376
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,540
Apart from the wisdom of God,

377
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,340
you're going to have a real hard time

378
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,780
figuring out whose son is who.

379
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,980
Who's telling the truth?

380
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,940
What's going on here?

381
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,660
In Solomon, he says bring me a sword.

382
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,859
Can you imagine?

383
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,380
Again, we're familiar with this,

384
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,220
but put yourself, inject yourself here

385
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,900
in the passage of Scripture.

386
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,580
The king said, bring me a sword.

387
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,619
And they brought a sword before the king.

388
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:22,380
And the king said, divide the living child in two

389
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,739
and give half to the one

390
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,940
and half to the other.

391
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,420
What?

392
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,059
Who would think of that?

393
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,299
Then spake the woman whose the living child was

394
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,700
unto the king in verse 26,

395
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,340
for her bowels yearned upon her son.

396
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,820
And she said, oh my Lord,

397
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,260
give her the living child

398
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,619
and in no wise slay it.

399
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,500
But the other said,

400
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,940
let it be neither mine nor thine,

401
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,739
but divide it.

402
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,299
What?

403
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,380
Solomon had his answer.

404
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,020
This wisdom that was on display,

405
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,700
the Bible says,

406
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
then the king answered and said,

407
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100
give her the living child.

408
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:09,640
living child and in no wise lay it she is the mother thereof and I want you to

409
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,400
notice in verse 28 the Bible says in all Israel heard of the judgment which the

410
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,960
king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was

411
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:31,180
in him to do judgment we need wisdom listen we live in a crazy world and we

412
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,400
don't need earthly wisdom which is not what we're speaking of the scene we're

413
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,160
talking about that heavenly wisdom that wisdom that comes from the omniscient

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,360
God who made this promise in James 1 in verse number 5 if any man lack right if

415
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,200
we lack wisdom let him ask of God who give it to all men liberally in a

416
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,640
braided knot and we find that in that passage of Scripture one of the things

417
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,720
that I have determined that is so essential for us is that the Bible says

418
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,840
if any man lacked the problem is that we have to recognize that we lack it so

419
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,160
that we ask for it but too often we don't have the kind of humility that

420
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,920
Solomon had see Solomon had the humility to say God's asking me what I want I can

421
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,880
ask him whatever I want and Solomon says you've been so good to me God you've

422
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,480
blessed me you've done all of these things you've shown mercy and all that

423
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,560
you've done I need wisdom Solomon wasn't full of himself he wasn't prideful

424
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,640
by the way I believe this evening that a prideful individual is not going to

425
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,400
recognize their need for wisdom they're not gonna ask for wisdom because they

426
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,520
don't think they need it they think they already have it amen and so where does

427
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,760
it begin it begins with that level of humility with us recognizing Lord I need

428
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,840
your wisdom and I'm praying I believe that you said I'm asking in faith I

429
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,920
believe that you said that if we ask that you'll give it so God I need your

430
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
wisdom by the way if you're asking God for wisdom you better get in the book

431
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,040
because he's gonna use his word to give you wisdom amen you're not gonna just go

432
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,360
to sleep at night and bam you're gonna have all this wisdom all right you need

433
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,400
to get in the word that's how God's gonna give it to you that's how he's

434
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,360
gonna provide that wisdom to you and we notice the wisdom back in Genesis

435
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,160
chapter number 13 the wisdom of Abram here in the passage of Scripture he says

436
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,200
let there be no strife in verse number 8 for we be brethren look at what he says

437
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,120
in verse number 9 is not the whole land before they separate myself I pray thee

438
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,640
from me notice that Abram makes this proposal to Lot and he says this if thou

439
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,120
will take the left hand that I will go to the right or if thou depart to the

440
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,960
right hand that I will go to the left he gives Lot the choice he makes the

441
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,800
proposal and he says to Lot listen here's how we need to solve this problem

442
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,160
it's not good for us to be in this situation where we have too much

443
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,120
substance the land is not adequate to support all of us and we need to be able

444
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,920
to separate because we need to have no strife between us it's a lot here's the

445
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,960
deal you choose where you want to go if you choose to the right I'll go to the

446
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,640
left if you choose the left I'll go to the right we find that the Bible tells

447
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,000
us that Lot makes the choice in verses 10 through 13 it's recorded for us that

448
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,120
Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well

449
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,040
watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the

450
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,920
garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt is now comest unto Zoar then Lot

451
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,080
chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed east and they separated

452
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,840
themselves the one from the other it says this in verse 12 Abram dwelt in the

453
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,640
land of Canaan and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent

454
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,480
towards Sodom it won't take long before he is in Sodom and the discussion of the

455
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,520
slippery slope of the decision of Lot will be detailed as we continue to

456
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,760
journey through the book of Genesis in fact it's in chapter 14 and verse 12 the

457
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,640
Bible tells us that he lot dwelt in Sodom and before long he'll be at the

458
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,920
city gate we find that he made this poor decision but we find that that decision

459
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,040
again separate from we're dealing with with Abram we see the wisdom of Abram

460
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,520
want you to consider with me he says let there be no strife let me make a New

461
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,320
Testament application if I can turn the book to Philippians if you will in

462
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,000
Philippians chapter number two as we look at the New Testament Church and we

463
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,480
look at the books of the Bible in the New Testament that are written to

464
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,960
churches and we find that these a number of these epistles are written to these

465
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,440
bodies of believers we understand that there in the church in Corinth there was

466
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
much division and strife and all sorts of things going on the church in Corinth

467
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,880
is known for being a carnal church Paul says that it's reported amongst you that

468
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,040
there's these divisions and stripes he said I believe it and we find that he

469
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,520
addresses those things and here in the book of Philippians I want you to notice

470
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,160
in verse number one of chapter number two Paul says this to the church in

471
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,800
Philippi if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of

472
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,200
love of any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies to fill ye my joy

473
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,960
notice what he says that you be like minded having the same love being of one

474
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:37,000
accord of one mind let what is the next word nothing that's a pretty significant

475
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,320
word is it not I mean it excludes everything right let nothing be done how

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:51,720
through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other

477
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,520
better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also

478
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,920
on the things of others he says let there be no strife he says this let

479
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,640
nothing be done through strife or vainglory we see that Abram says let

480
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,720
there be no strife why for we be brethren and Paul says of the believers

481
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,600
in Philippi he says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory we

482
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,720
understand this subject matter of vainglory it's the the individual

483
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,400
attention that is somebody wants and they want to be right they want to be

484
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,440
first they want to be recognized whatever the situation is and we find

485
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,520
here he says let nothing be done on those terms let there be no strife let

486
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,600
there be no vainglory he says this as we go through the passage he says look not

487
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,880
every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others we

488
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,360
speak about the importance of being a servant we speak about the importance of

489
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,320
recognizing the opportunities that God would give us to be a blessing to others

490
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:02,040
too often we get our eyes on our own lives my problem my situation my issue

491
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,600
my whatever and we might miss opportunities to be able to be a

492
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,660
blessing to be used of the Lord in somebody else's life because we're too

493
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,580
focused on me we're too focused on self and notice the example that Paul gives

494
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:26,260
in verse number five let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so he

495
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,220
uses the Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect example of this instruction is

496
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,140
giving here and we're familiar with the passage of Scripture here in Philippians

497
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,740
chapter number two he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus

498
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,780
who being in the form of God thought it not robbery be equal with God he is God

499
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,980
incarnate the Lord Jesus Christ we understand that he says in John 17 that

500
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,860
that he experienced that glory that he had from the beginning he was going to

501
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,540
finish the work we understand that in John chapter one as John the Baptist is

502
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,580
there who by the way physically speaking is older than the Lord Jesus Christ

503
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,940
Elizabeth gave birth to John the Baptist before Mary gave birth to the Lord Jesus

504
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,460
Christ and we find that John the Baptist says that he is before me he is

505
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,220
preferred above me and we find that he's understanding the eternality of the Lord

506
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,260
Jesus Christ and he's God incarnate and he comes it says here in verse 7 but made

507
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,500
himself of no reputation and took upon the form of a servant was made in the

508
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:39,020
likeness of men have you really stopped and considered the truth of what the

509
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,060
Lord Jesus Christ did for us and leave I mean we understand Calvary and what a

510
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,180
blessing and how grateful we are we think about this truth that he left the

511
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,440
the glory of heaven Paul said it this way as he's speaking to the church in

512
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,020
Corinth and in 2nd Corinthians 8 in verse number 9 he says for you know the grace

513
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,860
of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became

514
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:10,780
poor that ye through his poverty might be rich verse 7 but made himself of no

515
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,940
reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of

516
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,940
men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient

517
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,780
unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted

518
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,860
him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus

519
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
every knee should bow things in heaven things in earth things under the earth

520
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,620
that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God

521
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:44,020
the Father Paul says let nothing be done through strife or vain glory Solomon the

522
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,620
one that we mentioned his wisdom that was on display in first Kings chapter

523
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:54,460
number three he tells us in the book of Proverbs that by pride comes contention

524
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:04,180
by pride comes destruction we find that here is we would look at the truth of

525
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,100
of Genesis chapter number 13.

526
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,300
And as we look at the life of Abram

527
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,980
as it's traced here in these verses of Scripture

528
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,380
and these events that are unfolding in his life,

529
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,780
he was walking with the Lord.

530
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,740
He was returning back to the place where God had led him.

531
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,720
But we find that there's a problem again.

532
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,260
Remember, there was a problem in Genesis chapter number 12.

533
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,980
There was a great famine.

534
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,120
And now there's a problem.

535
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,140
There's strife between his herdmen and Lot's herdmen.

536
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,860
And the wisdom of Abram is on display

537
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,260
in how he addresses that problem

538
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,120
and how he deals with that.

539
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,100
We have the privilege of tracing

540
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,040
the steps of the life of Abraham.

541
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,460
And we have the privilege of being able

542
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,220
to see much Scripture that is given to us.

543
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,660
And as we would analyze and look at the Scriptures,

544
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,420
we would have the opportunities

545
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,560
to see the way in which he lived his life

546
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,820
and how we can learn lessons as we live our lives.

547
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,560
We need wisdom.

548
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,480
We're going to have problems.

549
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,060
We need God's wisdom.

550
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,220
Not only do we see the walk and wisdom of Abram,

551
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,580
but I want you to notice his worship.

552
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,220
It's interesting how that in Hebrews 11,

553
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,780
this morning we dealt with the walk of Enoch

554
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,620
and we dealt with the worship of Abel.

555
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,060
And here we see the walk of Abram

556
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,860
and the worship of Abram.

557
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,200
But I want you to notice the Bible tells us this

558
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,580
in verse number 13,

559
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,780
and then we'll get right into verses 14 through 18

560
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,840
and look at the worship of Abram.

561
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,860
But notice what the Bible says,

562
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners

563
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,220
before the Lord exceedingly.

564
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,940
And again, that's the place in which Lot had chosen

565
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,380
and pitched his tent towards Sodom.

566
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,220
But now the Lord is going to speak to Abram.

567
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,020
Isn't that encouraging?

568
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,920
I understand this morning, this evening,

569
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,220
I said this morning twice already, man alive.

570
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,640
I didn't sleep well last night.

571
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,140
I'll blame it on that.

572
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,260
But the reality, I had an hour nap this afternoon

573
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,100
in my office.

574
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,900
I woke up and I really didn't know where I was.

575
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,820
It was amazing.

576
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,660
Amen.

577
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,020
And praise the Lord.

578
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,220
I put that recliner back and I was out.

579
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,220
And anyway, the Bible says that the Lord said unto Abram,

580
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:17,380
see God audibly spoke to his servants.

581
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,660
And sometimes people today say,

582
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,120
I wish God would audibly speak to me.

583
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,380
You have this book.

584
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,760
This is the voice of God.

585
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,160
This is God speaking to us as His people today.

586
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,440
By the way, I understand that as we go through life,

587
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,500
that it's very easy for us to say,

588
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,720
well, I wish that was my situation.

589
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,120
I wish I was over there.

590
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,920
I would exchange these problems for those problems.

591
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Probably if you did, you'd find out that you made a mistake.

592
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,320
Sometimes we say, man, I wish I lived in that era.

593
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,720
I wish I lived during that time.

594
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,440
I wish I had the experience of what these folks had.

595
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,960
Listen, I'm thankful to live in 2020

596
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,040
and to have the whole Bible.

597
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,200
What a blessing.

598
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,600
And we find that God in His wisdom has allowed us,

599
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,640
ordained us to be alive today.

600
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,000
And so we have this truth of the Word of God

601
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,760
and we have the very voice of God.

602
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,640
We have the words of God.

603
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,840
And here the Bible says the Lord said unto Abram,

604
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,160
I wonder this evening, when you read your Bible,

605
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,160
when you attend a church service like this,

606
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,120
are you listening for the voice of God?

607
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,040
Are you looking for God to speak to you?

608
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,400
Do we come with that expectation,

609
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
with that anticipation when we enter

610
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,560
into our time of devotion on a daily basis?

611
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,280
When we come to a church service,

612
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,040
are we coming expecting that God is going to speak to me?

613
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,600
Are we coming anticipating saying, Lord, I'm listening?

614
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,360
It's like Samuel, right?

615
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,520
When he goes to Eli, you've called.

616
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,440
No, I didn't.

617
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,520
He comes again, you call, no, I didn't.

618
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,440
He says, here's what you do.

619
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,080
Next time you hear it, say, speak, Lord,

620
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,000
thy servant listens, hears.

621
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,200
See, are we listening for the voice of God?

622
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,920
I had the privilege this week of speaking to someone

623
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,920
who I best could describe the conversation

624
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,840
as an individual who's hungering and thirsting

625
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,400
after God and after righteousness.

626
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,120
Can I tell you, those are exciting conversations.

627
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,160
When someone just, I mean, two hours

628
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,520
and 20 minutes pass like that.

629
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,720
Why, because it's like, tell me something else.

630
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,120
Give me some more truth.

631
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,040
Show me this.

632
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,080
I mean, they're hungering and thirsting

633
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,760
after the word of God.

634
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,200
I love it.

635
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,480
It's great.

636
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,760
And I wonder in our lives, is it just a box that we check?

637
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,480
Read my Bible today, went to church this morning,

638
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,560
went to church tonight, went to the revival meeting,

639
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,080
checked the box.

640
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,480
Are we coming to listen for the voice of God?

641
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,800
God, speak to me.

642
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,960
The Lord spoke to Abram.

643
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,000
And notice what the Lord said in verse 14 and following.

644
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,840
The Lord said unto Abram after that lot

645
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,280
was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes

646
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,840
and look from the place where thou art.

647
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Northward, southward, eastward, and westward.

648
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,120
In other words, he says, look everywhere,

649
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,040
in every direction.

650
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,040
From the place where you are, look in every direction.

651
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,040
That's what God tells him.

652
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,400
And then God says this.

653
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,400
For all the land which thou seest,

654
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,280
to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

655
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,520
That's a great promise, is it not?

656
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,840
The promise of God to Abram with regard to the land.

657
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,600
We find that it's not only the land, but it's the seed.

658
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,200
We find that he says that the land which thou seest,

659
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,200
to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

660
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,360
And I will, notice where he says,

661
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,240
I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth

662
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,720
so that if a man can number the dust of the earth,

663
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,600
then shall thy seed also be numbered by the way.

664
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,160
We're familiar with Abraham and Sarah.

665
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,960
Now, Abram and Sarai, do they have any seed?

666
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,280
No!

667
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,080
Sarai, the Bible tells us in chapter number 11,

668
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
she's barren.

669
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,160
And yet, God is giving this promise

670
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,000
about the blessing, not only of the land, but the seed.

671
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,160
By the way, they're both elevated in years, shall we say?

672
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,040
But God's making a promise.

673
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
Can I tell you this evening

674
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,000
that when God makes a promise, it's sure.

675
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,240
We can stand upon it.

676
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,040
We sing the song, by the way, standing on the promises.

677
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
I cannot fall, right?

678
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,680
The songwriter says.

679
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,520
And we think about the promises of God.

680
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,680
Peter says that they're exceeding precious,

681
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,880
great and precious promises.

682
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,600
We get into the word of God and we study it and we say,

683
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,320
God, you have some promises for me today.

684
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,840
He does.

685
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,120
Look for them.

686
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,600
Search them out.

687
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
Reclaim them.

688
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,880
The promises of God.

689
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,720
He says, I'm gonna give you a land.

690
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,480
I'm gonna bless your seed.

691
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Notice in verse 17, he continues,

692
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,160
God speaking to Abram and says,

693
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,440
arise, walk through the land in the length of it

694
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,440
and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

695
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,280
We're speaking about the worship of God.

696
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
We're noticing the way in which Abram

697
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,720
would worship the Lord.

698
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,240
But in verses 14 through 17, we're really seeing

699
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,040
the way in which God is speaking to Abram.

700
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,440
But the response of this promise,

701
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,880
the response to this promise,

702
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,320
the response of Abram is to worship the Lord.

703
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,840
To worship the Lord.

704
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,360
We see in verse number 18,

705
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,960
it says, then Abram removed his tent.

706
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,800
The idea of that phraseology that we find

707
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,160
in verse number 17, God's instruction was,

708
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,280
arise, walk through the land in the length of it

709
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,320
and the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

710
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,920
And so the idea of then Abram removed his tent

711
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,600
is that he began to journey and moving his tent with them

712
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,320
as he was going through the land.

713
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,960
And he's moving and he's taking, making progress,

714
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,600
following what God said in verse number 17.

715
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,280
And he kept moving along the way, staking his claim,

716
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
believing the promise of God.

717
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Faith.

718
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,800
And it says this,

719
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,640
and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre,

720
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,360
which is in Hebron, and notice,

721
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,760
and built there an altar unto the Lord.

722
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,240
It is said on a number of occasions about Abram

723
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,160
that he built an altar unto the Lord.

724
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,800
We read it on a number of occasions in chapter number 12.

725
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,280
We read in chapter 13 and verse number four

726
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,200
how that he came to the place which he had made there

727
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,640
at the first and there that altar that he made.

728
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,840
Remember in verse number three,

729
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,320
it says that he came to a place where his tent

730
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,680
had been at the beginning between Bethel and Ai.

731
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,160
And we find that there he had built that altar.

732
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,360
And here the Bible says in verse number four

733
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,720
that Abram called on the name of the Lord.

734
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
He did that back in chapter number 12

735
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,000
as we found record of that in verse number eight.

736
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,400
And now we see in chapter number 13 and verse number four

737
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,640
and in verse number 18,

738
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,680
there he built an altar unto the Lord.

739
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,160
He's worshiping the Lord.

740
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,120
See, Abram is living during the era of Israel's history

741
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,280
where there is no tabernacle.

742
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,560
That's not gonna come for a long period of time.

743
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,800
There is no temple that's even further out in the distance.

744
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,640
And so what did Abram do?

745
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,920
Built an altar.

746
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,120
By the way, that's what Noah did after he got off the ark.

747
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
We spoke about that this morning as well.

748
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,120
that he built an altar and he called upon the Lord and he's worshiping the Lord.

749
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,080
So we think about the promises of God and we think about

750
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,840
the way in which God is giving and speaking to Abram

751
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,040
here in this passage of Scripture in verses 14 through 17.

752
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,440
The natural response is to worship the Lord.

753
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,680
To worship Him. This evening as we would take the passage of Scripture that is

754
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,240
before us and we would consider the walk and the wisdom and

755
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,920
the worship of Abram, I wonder as we walk with God,

756
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,560
are we daily walking with Him like we should be? Are we in the place where

757
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,160
we're supposed to be? Are we asking God and depending on God

758
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,880
for the wisdom that we need for the the problems that we face in life?

759
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
There will be problems. There are problems.

760
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,120
Right? We need God's wisdom and we see that Abram, we notice his

761
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,080
wisdom on display here in the passage. But how thankful I am for how the

762
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,600
Lord spoke to him. You understand that God didn't speak to Lot in this

763
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,680
fashion, in this manner. See, Lot chose something based upon

764
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,840
sight. He lifted up his eyes and he saw this and he...

765
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,280
By the way, he's pitched towards Sodom. We said already that the men

766
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,200
of that city were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

767
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,720
He'd soon be influenced by them. But as Abram made that decision, he made

768
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,160
that proposal and he told Lot, you choose and I'll go the

769
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,000
other way. And then the Lord spoke to him. He says,

770
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,480
look at every direction. I'm going to give you this land. I'm

771
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,720
going to bless your seed. And what does he do? He

772
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
worships. Can I tell you this morning? Oh man, this

773
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,720
evening? Can I tell you tonight? Listen, three times. Man, alive.

774
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,040
Can I tell you this evening? That we need to worship God.

775
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,720
Listen, when you approach the Word of God and He speaks to you

776
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,920
and He gives you some promises, oh would you just worship Him?

777
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,720
You know, what a joy it is to just get in His presence for a little while.

778
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,120
Not necessarily to ask for anything. Just to worship Him.

779
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,480
Just to praise Him for who He is. Just to thank Him for giving you a Bible.

780
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,880
For giving you a church where you can go and

781
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,400
hear the Word of God. For giving you an opportunity to receive

782
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,680
the promises of God. To be in a place where you've been

783
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,320
aware of who He is. How He's revealed Himself to you.

784
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,600
Oh, you just get in His presence a little while and you begin to

785
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,320
just get filled with God and stand in awe of who He is.

786
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,840
You begin to worship. It's amazing how you find yourself in that place and

787
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,160
how God will bless. And how God will come and commune with

788
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,120
you. And how He will meet the needs of

789
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,680
each of us, His people. He's a God who is able.

790
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,000
This evening we see that Abram, the passage finishes with him

791
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,880
worshiping. With him worshiping the Lord. Building an altar.

792
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,560
We see his walk. We see his wisdom. We see his worship. This evening, oh that we'd

793
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,040
walk with God. Oh that we'd ask God, recognize that we

794
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,080
need His wisdom. Get into the book and worship Him. He is

795
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,320
worthy of our worship. Let's pray. Father, we love you.

796
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,840
We thank you so much for loving us.

797
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,240
We thank you for who you are. You are the Lord God Omnipotent.

798
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,160
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty. In just a little while,

799
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,320
in Bible history, from the place where we are this evening, you will reveal

800
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:03,040
yourself to Abraham as El Shaddai, Lord God Almighty.

801
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,600
We thank you that you've given us your Word.

802
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,280
And then on a regular basis, as often as we please, we can

803
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,640
enter into your presence. Dig into your Word.

804
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,520
Commune with you.

805
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,880
The thought of that calls us to rejoice.

806
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:39,200
That we could be in your presence. We thank you that you spoke to Abraham.

807
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,640
We thank you this evening that we have the entirety of the Bible and that you

808
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,640
still speak to us today. And God, I pray that you'd help us to

809
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,480
listen for your voice. I pray that you'd help us to

810
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,440
enter our daily time with you in each church service that we attend.

811
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,320
Anticipate and expecting that you're going to speak to us.

812
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,240
Help us to receive and claim the promises. Help us, Lord, to worship you,

813
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,920
for you are worthy of our worship.

814
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,680
Lord, I pray this evening that we've been challenged and encouraged by the

815
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,480
opportunity to study these events in the life of Abraham.

816
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,600
Perhaps there are some this evening that have some

817
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,280
problems that they're facing in life. They need your wisdom.

818
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,720
God, would you help us, as Solomon did, to humble ourselves.

819
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,600
To recognize that you are the all-wise God and that you've promised to give us

820
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,120
wisdom if we simply ask.

821
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,040
Help us to humble ourselves and to acknowledge our need.

822
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,840
And God, we trust you to give us the wisdom that we need to

823
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,000
navigate this life and to address problems that will arise. I pray, God, that

824
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,960
you would work in hearts and lives that decisions would be made that would

825
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,200
please thee and we'll thank you for it. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

826
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,880
eyes are closed. Holly's going to play quietly on the piano.

827
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,360
As she does, we'll have a time of invitation, opportunity for you to

828
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,800
respond. Maybe you just want to thank God. Maybe

829
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,200
you want to ask him for wisdom. Maybe there's some problems you're dealing

830
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,920
with in life.

831
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,080
And you just want to come and worship the Lord a little bit this evening.

832
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,120
Thank him for speaking to you. Thank him for

833
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:40,000
allowing you to enter into his presence. As Holly plays, the altar is open.
