WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
course finished up the 12th chapter a couple of weeks ago and we took a couple

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:09.119
of lessons to get through Genesis chapter number 12 and as we finished up

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.399
the latter part of Genesis chapter number 12 we had the opportunity to look

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.639
at verses 10 through 20 and as we looked at that passage of Scripture we found

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:21.659
that Abram of course had followed the direction of the Lord and had gone to

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.399
the promised land to the land of Canaan we refer to it as the promised land and

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.200
he arrived in the land of Canaan in the first section of Genesis chapter number

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.479
12 of course they had left the Ur of the Chaldees went to Haran and then down to

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.819
Canaan the Bible told us in Genesis chapter number 12 that there was a great

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:44.400
famine it was a grievous famine and Abram left with him and his wife and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.720
all that they had lot in his all of the cattle all of the herds all that they

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.000
had and they went to Egypt and we found that the Scriptures told us in those 10

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.560
verses at the end of Genesis chapter number 12 how that Abram and all that he

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:03.680
had went down into Egypt and we made some interesting under just really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.720
interesting truth that is given to us here in Genesis chapter number 12 with

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.839
regard to the demonstration of God's power and the ability for our God to

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:19.040
work through all situations and of course Abram sought to lean on his own

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.040
understanding and convince Sarah to say Sarah I at the time that she was his

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.879
sister and so on and so forth but God demonstrated his power and protect it

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:35.839
Sarah I and protected Abram and we find that our God is able amen and we don't

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:39.360
have to rely on our own understanding in fact the Bible tells us that we're to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.839
trust in the Lord with all of our hearts that we're not to lean on our own

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:47.680
understanding and what a blessing it is when we see God work and when we have

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.239
the opportunity as we did at the end of Genesis chapter number 12 to see what

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.480
God is able to do I finished the passage by asking this question did we

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.879
learn a lesson I asked if Abram learned a lesson but we know that he repeats

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.599
the same mistake later on in the book of Genesis but I wonder this evening and I

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.440
asked the question two weeks ago did we learn a lesson did we learn that our God

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.320
is able I believe as I mentioned in that particular message that if Abram would

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.679
have walked right into Egypt and said yes she is my wife God would have

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:28.160
protected her because our God is able he didn't have to come up with some scheme

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.880
and devise some story and I understand that in his mind he justified it because

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.800
of the fact that he and and Sarah I were half sisters and so or half siblings and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.199
so on and so forth but we understand that our God is able he is able to do we

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.119
understand as we have the New Testament principles in Ephesians 3 that he's able

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.520
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask her think that's the God

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.240
that we serve and we find that after the events unfold at the end of Genesis

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.360
chapter number 12 that Pharaoh says to to Abram in verse number 19 why sets now

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.679
she is my sister so I might have taken her to meet a wife now therefore behold

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:13.520
thy wife take her and go thy way and the Bible tells us that Pharaoh

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.279
commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.839
that he had and we enter chapter 13 the fact the passage will be studying this

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:27.039
evening and the Bible says this and Abram went up out of Egypt he and his

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.919
wife and all that he had and a lot with him into the south and Abram was very

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.000
rich in cattle and silver and gold and he he went on his journeys from the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.679
south even to Bethel under the place where his tent had been at the beginning

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.119
between Bethel and AI under the place of the altar which he had made there at

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:51.279
the first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord and lot also which went

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:56.039
with Abram had flocks and herds and tents the land was not able to bear them

00:03:56.039 --> 00:04:00.160
that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.479
not dwell together notice in verse number eight if you will the Bible says

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:12.279
this and Abram said unto lot let there be no strife I pray thee between me and

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:19.200
thee between my herd men and thy herd men for we be brethren now I'd like to

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.079
preach a message this evening and really we're gonna look at the entirety of

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.480
Genesis 13 that I've simply entitled from verse number eight let there be no

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.679
strife let there be no strife as we look at the passage of Scripture and we see

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.880
how that Abram would now depart from Egypt he and his family and all that he

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.600
had you find that there in verse number one the Bible says that Abram went up

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.839
out of Egypt he and his wife notice this and all that he had and lot with him

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.679
notice in verse number two the Bible says that Abram was very rich in cattle

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:55.679
and silver and gold we found that in verse number 16 of Genesis 12 the Bible

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:01.320
told us that Pharaoh entreated Abram well for her sake and he Abram had sheep

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.959
and oxen and he asses and men servants and maidservants and she asses and

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:10.760
camels and we find that God had blessed Abram and as we consider the passage of

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.839
Scripture that is before us and we look at these first six verses if you're

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.559
taking notes I want you to notice with me his walk notice the walk of Abram I

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:23.679
want you to consider he had been in the land of Canaan he had been in the very

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:29.119
place where God had promised him to go and as he had gone to that place as he

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.359
arrived to the place where God had instructed them and led him to be he

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:38.000
endured difficulty there was a famine I said this is I was speaking to a

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.640
missionary friend just on a day or two after I preached the message two weeks

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.880
ago here from Genesis chapter number 12 I said the God of the universe I think I

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.399
mentioned it during the message as well but the God of the universe he is

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:54.720
omniscient he is omnipotent we find that he knows all things he knows the end

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.119
from the beginning he is Alpha and Omega and we find that God Almighty had

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:08.119
directed Abram and his family to travel to arrive in this place when there would

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:17.440
be a famine no doubt in my mind that God could have led Abram to arrive when

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.519
there wasn't gonna be a famine no doubt in my mind that God because he's

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:29.320
omnipotent he has all power he could have prevented the famine but you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.440
understand that he led him to arrive when there was gonna be a famine see God

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.720
he works in our lives to develop us to help us to trust him and to see what he's

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.440
able to do I think about the disciples and how that Jesus said to them get on

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.600
the ship and go across the sea knowing that they were going to encounter a

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.440
storm by the way he's the same God that could say peace be still and calm the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.040
storm but yet he did not prevent the storm from happening he wanted to show

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.000
his power we find that Abram made the decision I mentioned it last time as we

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.220
looked at chapter number 12 he made that decision to depart the land that God had

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.200
led him to and because of that famine he goes down to Egypt and we find that he's

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.359
there throughout the scriptures we find that Egypt is a picture of the world and

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:29.720
we find that he Abram and his family and all that he had they go down to Egypt

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.480
and there he has the opportunity to see God work he was fearful that that his

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.399
life would be taken because of Sarai and her beauty and the fact that Pharaoh

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:47.000
would take her and yet it was that very Pharaoh that said here take your wife

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.720
and be gone we find that he now is going to journey back to the place where

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.920
God had originally led him to there in the place of Cain and we found all the

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.679
way back in Genesis chapter 3 11 how that God spoke to Abram and gave him

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:09.720
that direction to leave the earth the Cowdys they could not travel across the

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:16.320
Arabian Desert for many reasons and so they had to go northwestward as they

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.959
would go to Haran and then they would leave her on and then go down to Canaan

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:26.000
and we find that now this man Abram and all that he has they're now going to

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.279
journey and the Bible tells us in verse number three as we think about his walk

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:34.679
and the Bible says that he went on his journey from the south even to Bethel

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:41.479
notice what it says unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:47.640
between Bethel and Ai you notice that as we studied the 12th chapter then in

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.520
verse number eight that the Bible tells us that he removed this unto a mountain

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.359
on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and Ai on

00:08:56.359 --> 00:09:00.359
the east and there he built it an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name

00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:05.359
of the Lord and we see the walk of Abram and we see as they would travel and

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:09.840
journey and now they're leaving that place they're leaving Egypt and they're

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.640
walking they're journeying back to that land of promise the land that God had

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.400
led them to we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four under the place

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.559
of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:27.960
name of the Lord will come back to verse number four at the end of the message

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.559
and make reference there again but I want you to see what the Bible tells us

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:36.140
about lot here in verses five and six and about what's taking place the Bible

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.859
says this that the that law also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and

00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:49.179
tents now we find that there was a level of blessing that God had poured out not

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:55.539
only upon Abram but upon law as well and we find that they were receiving and

00:09:55.539 --> 00:10:02.140
enjoying the blessing of the Lord and the Bible tells us in verse number six

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.180
that the land was not able to bear them.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.120
As we would think about the increase of possessions,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.880
it led to a shortage of land.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.640
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.480
that the land was not able to bear them,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.100
that they might dwell together,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.260
for their substance was great,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.000
so that they could not dwell together.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.620
I want you to just for a moment

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.100
consider as Abram would leave Egypt

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.500
and he's following the Lord

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.660
and going back to Canaan.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.700
That's a good walk.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.820
As you would walk back to the place

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.940
where God had initially led him

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.740
as God was giving him that direction.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.620
Of course, we know that Stephen,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.820
as he is preaching in Acts 7,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.820
he makes note of Abram

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.340
and his entrance into the land of Canaan

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.860
and the dwelling there

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.180
and all of the blessing.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.340
And so, we find that now Abram

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.220
is back in the place where he's supposed to be.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.980
I'm so thankful that our God is gracious.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.980
I'm so thankful that we can walk with Him.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.660
We spoke about Enoch this morning.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.020
And we spoke about the fact

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.740
that he walked with God.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.700
He pleased the Lord.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.980
And we see that in Genesis 11

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.660
and verses 5 and 6.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.580
And what a joy.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.180
And now we see that Abram,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.620
as he is walking back,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.060
and I believe that during this journey,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.860
no doubt there were some things

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.940
that he would contemplate.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.940
There's some things that he's considering

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.060
as he's returning.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.420
And he's experienced some blessings

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.460
and he's seeing the rich blessing

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.980
that the Lord poured upon him

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.300
and upon his nephew Lot.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.780
We find not only his walk,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.380
but I want you to notice number 2

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.460
in verses 7-13.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.020
I want you to notice his wisdom.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.540
Notice his wisdom.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.860
In verse 7, the Bible tells us

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.900
that there was a strife

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.900
between the herdmen of Abram's cattle

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.460
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.900
Now, we understand that as we look

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.380
at what's taking place here

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.340
and we see the cause of this strife

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.220
that's revealed to us in verse 6,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.780
the Bible says that the land

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.980
was not able to bear them.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.580
And we see that because of their increased goods

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.060
and substance that the land was insufficient

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.300
and we find that there's this problem

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.260
and it results in this strife

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.940
and the herdmen of Abram

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.220
and the herdmen of Lot,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.420
they have this strife.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.140
And notice what the Bible says

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.100
at the end of verse 7,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.260
and the Canaanite and the Perizzite

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.940
dwelled then in the land.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.420
Now, we will not take time

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.660
to develop all of it,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.300
but we had discussed during the time

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.220
in which Noah would make his

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.340
prophetic statements how the Canaanites

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.260
would be the dwellers of that particular land,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.300
and we see here that the Bible says

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.020
that the Canaanite and the Perizzite

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.740
dwelled then in the land.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.260
There's a couple of observations

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.740
that I make from that statement of Scripture.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.300
Number one is this,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.180
that there are others that are living there.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.780
I think about when Jesus told them

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.340
to get on the ship and the Bible says

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.460
that there were other little ships.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.700
You know that you're not the only one

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.220
going through a storm in life.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:07.940
Amen?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.860
There were other little ships.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.460
There were other ships on the sea.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.100
There are other folks that are dealing

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.940
with difficulties,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.300
and so there's other people in this land,

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.780
but one thing that I notice

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.620
is that the Canaanite and Perizzite,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.260
these people groups that are mentioned,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.700
they now are witnessing this strife

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.900
between the herdmen of Abram

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.500
and the herdmen of Lot.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.580
Brethren, it ought not be

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.420
that the world would see the people of God

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.820
engaged in strife.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.380
Amen?

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.060
And that's what we see that's happening.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.740
We see that here,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.860
as there's this strife that's taking place,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.060
no doubt that Abram has a measure of wisdom

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.220
as we see as he begins to respond to Lot

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.340
and he gives them these options,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.300
and we find it in verse 8

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.860
that Abram said unto Lot,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.700
let there be no strife.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.500
Let there be no strife, I pray Thee,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.580
between me and Thee

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.180
and between my herdmen and Thy herdmen.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.140
Notice what he says,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.820
for we be brethren.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.540
And we find that Abram,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.220
as he would respond properly

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.460
to this problem that is here,

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.940
we understand in life

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.780
that there's no doubt

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.380
that we're going to face problems.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.660
We're going to face difficulties and challenges.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.380
Can I tell you that the enemy,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.900
he seeks to cause division.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.900
He seeks to set people at variance

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.300
one with another.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.860
He seeks to divide

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.940
and to cause schisms within the body.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.260
That's what the enemy wants to do.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.620
And we find here that Abram responds

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.700
and he says,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.180
let there be no strife, I pray Thee,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.220
between me and Thee

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.420
and between my herdmen and Thy herdmen,

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.300
for we be brethren.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.940
For we be brethren.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.460
I notice that as we would look

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.460
at the response of Abram here

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.220
and we're noticing the wisdom of Abram

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.500
that we will understand

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.460
and easily recognize this evening

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.580
that if we're going to resolve

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.580
the problems that we face in life,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.660
that we are going to need the wisdom of God.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.900
And the thing that's wonderful

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.140
is that God says that He'll give us wisdom.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.500
We can have His wisdom.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.780
We don't have to rely upon our own

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.420
way of thinking and our own solutions to problems.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.060
We can have the wisdom of God.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.660
I want to keep your spot here,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.700
but turn to the book of 1 Kings if you will

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.060
in chapter 3.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.420
And we're familiar with the passage of Scripture

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.260
here in 1 Kings 3

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.620
and what's taking place.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.260
And you find that Solomon is now

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.420
the king of Israel

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.100
and he is now sitting and reigning

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.540
and his father David of course,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.740
a great king,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.780
and now Solomon,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.180
the third king of the nation of Israel,

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.220
Saul, David, and now Solomon.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.460
And he's reigning

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.580
and he's real early on here in his reign.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.740
And the Bible tells us

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.580
that the Lord appears to him.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.140
And as the Lord appears to him,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.300
in verse 5 it says,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.460
in Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.700
in a dream by night

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.540
and God said,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.940
ask what I shall give thee.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.140
Can you imagine?

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.500
I was reading just recently

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.460
through the Gospel records

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:30.020
and how Herod said to ask what you want of me.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.500
And of course, the whole situation

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.100
with the head of John the Baptist.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.420
You think about Ahasuerus

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.220
when he says to Esther,

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.220
ask what you will up to the half of my kingdom.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.300
And here, the God of the universe

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.300
appears to Solomon in this dream

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.660
and He says, ask what I shall give thee.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.580
And we find that Solomon responds

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.220
in verse 6,

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:49.900
and Solomon said,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.700
Thou hast showed unto Thy servant David,

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.540
my father, great mercy,

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.300
according as he walked before Thee

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.740
in truth and in righteousness

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.100
and in uprightness of heart with Thee.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.660
And Thou hast kept for him

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.780
this great kindness

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.940
that Thou hast given him a son

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.180
to sit on his throne as it is this day.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.540
Do you see in verse 6

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.580
the humility of Solomon?

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.860
The recognition of the goodness of God

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.420
in his life and the blessing

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.060
and the mercy that God has shown,

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.820
the favor that God has shown?

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.420
You see it in verse 6.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.340
Notice as he continues in verse 7,

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.380
And now, O Lord my God,

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.260
Thou hast made Thy servant king

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.140
instead of David my father.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.780
And I am but a little child.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.020
I know not how to go out or come in.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.900
And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.340
which Thou hast chosen a great people

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.660
that cannot be numbered

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.180
nor counted for multitude.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.660
Give therefore Thy servant

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.340
an understanding heart to judge Thy people

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.740
that I may discern between good and bad

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.860
for who is able to judge this

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.860
Thy so great a people?

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.980
I love what the Bible tells us in verse 10.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.700
And the speech pleased the Lord.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.820
That Solomon had asked this thing.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.500
Solomon said give me understanding.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.140
Give me wisdom

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.620
to be able to lead and judge Thy people.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.500
Notice the text of Scripture

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.020
in 1 Kings 3, beginning in verse 16.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.820
We don't have time to deal with all of it,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.220
but down through verse 28

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.540
is the first opportunity for Solomon

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.940
to display this wisdom

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.020
that God had supernaturally given him.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.980
And we find that there's this situation

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.740
with a child that died in the night

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.100
and the one mother says,

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.380
no, the dead child's yours.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.260
And the other one says, no, the dead child's yours.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.580
And so on and so forth.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.700
And the Bible says this in verse 22,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.980
And the other woman said, nay,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.100
but the living is my son

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.460
and the dead is thy son.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.460
And this said, no.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.700
But the dead is thy son

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.020
and the living is my son.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.859
Thus they spake before the king.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:50.380
Verse 23, Then said the king,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.340
the one saith, this is my son that liveth

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.980
and thy son is the dead.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.299
And the other saith, nay,

00:18:55.299 --> 00:18:56.500
but thy son is the dead

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.059
and my son is the living.

00:18:58.059 --> 00:18:59.540
Apart from the wisdom of God,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.340
you're going to have a real hard time

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.780
figuring out whose son is who.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.980
Who's telling the truth?

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.940
What's going on here?

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.660
In Solomon, he says bring me a sword.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.859
Can you imagine?

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.380
Again, we're familiar with this,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.220
but put yourself, inject yourself here

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.900
in the passage of Scripture.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.580
The king said, bring me a sword.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.619
And they brought a sword before the king.

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.380
And the king said, divide the living child in two

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.739
and give half to the one

00:19:23.739 --> 00:19:25.940
and half to the other.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.420
What?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.059
Who would think of that?

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:36.299
Then spake the woman whose the living child was

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:37.700
unto the king in verse 26,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.340
for her bowels yearned upon her son.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.820
And she said, oh my Lord,

00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:45.260
give her the living child

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.619
and in no wise slay it.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.500
But the other said,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.940
let it be neither mine nor thine,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.739
but divide it.

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:54.299
What?

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:57.380
Solomon had his answer.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.020
This wisdom that was on display,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.700
the Bible says,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.100
then the king answered and said,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.100
give her the living child.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.640
living child and in no wise lay it she is the mother thereof and I want you to

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:15.400
notice in verse 28 the Bible says in all Israel heard of the judgment which the

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.960
king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:31.180
in him to do judgment we need wisdom listen we live in a crazy world and we

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:36.400
don't need earthly wisdom which is not what we're speaking of the scene we're

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.160
talking about that heavenly wisdom that wisdom that comes from the omniscient

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:46.360
God who made this promise in James 1 in verse number 5 if any man lack right if

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.200
we lack wisdom let him ask of God who give it to all men liberally in a

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.640
braided knot and we find that in that passage of Scripture one of the things

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.720
that I have determined that is so essential for us is that the Bible says

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.840
if any man lacked the problem is that we have to recognize that we lack it so

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:13.160
that we ask for it but too often we don't have the kind of humility that

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.920
Solomon had see Solomon had the humility to say God's asking me what I want I can

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.880
ask him whatever I want and Solomon says you've been so good to me God you've

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.480
blessed me you've done all of these things you've shown mercy and all that

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:33.560
you've done I need wisdom Solomon wasn't full of himself he wasn't prideful

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.640
by the way I believe this evening that a prideful individual is not going to

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.400
recognize their need for wisdom they're not gonna ask for wisdom because they

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.520
don't think they need it they think they already have it amen and so where does

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.760
it begin it begins with that level of humility with us recognizing Lord I need

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.840
your wisdom and I'm praying I believe that you said I'm asking in faith I

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.920
believe that you said that if we ask that you'll give it so God I need your

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.920
wisdom by the way if you're asking God for wisdom you better get in the book

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:10.040
because he's gonna use his word to give you wisdom amen you're not gonna just go

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.360
to sleep at night and bam you're gonna have all this wisdom all right you need

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.400
to get in the word that's how God's gonna give it to you that's how he's

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.360
gonna provide that wisdom to you and we notice the wisdom back in Genesis

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.160
chapter number 13 the wisdom of Abram here in the passage of Scripture he says

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.200
let there be no strife in verse number 8 for we be brethren look at what he says

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.120
in verse number 9 is not the whole land before they separate myself I pray thee

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:43.640
from me notice that Abram makes this proposal to Lot and he says this if thou

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.120
will take the left hand that I will go to the right or if thou depart to the

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.960
right hand that I will go to the left he gives Lot the choice he makes the

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.800
proposal and he says to Lot listen here's how we need to solve this problem

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.160
it's not good for us to be in this situation where we have too much

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.120
substance the land is not adequate to support all of us and we need to be able

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.920
to separate because we need to have no strife between us it's a lot here's the

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.960
deal you choose where you want to go if you choose to the right I'll go to the

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.640
left if you choose the left I'll go to the right we find that the Bible tells

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:25.000
us that Lot makes the choice in verses 10 through 13 it's recorded for us that

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.120
Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.040
watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.920
garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt is now comest unto Zoar then Lot

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.080
chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed east and they separated

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.840
themselves the one from the other it says this in verse 12 Abram dwelt in the

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.640
land of Canaan and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:58.480
towards Sodom it won't take long before he is in Sodom and the discussion of the

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.520
slippery slope of the decision of Lot will be detailed as we continue to

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.760
journey through the book of Genesis in fact it's in chapter 14 and verse 12 the

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.640
Bible tells us that he lot dwelt in Sodom and before long he'll be at the

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:20.920
city gate we find that he made this poor decision but we find that that decision

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.040
again separate from we're dealing with with Abram we see the wisdom of Abram

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.520
want you to consider with me he says let there be no strife let me make a New

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.320
Testament application if I can turn the book to Philippians if you will in

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:39.000
Philippians chapter number two as we look at the New Testament Church and we

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.480
look at the books of the Bible in the New Testament that are written to

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.960
churches and we find that these a number of these epistles are written to these

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.440
bodies of believers we understand that there in the church in Corinth there was

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.000
much division and strife and all sorts of things going on the church in Corinth

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.880
is known for being a carnal church Paul says that it's reported amongst you that

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:08.040
there's these divisions and stripes he said I believe it and we find that he

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.520
addresses those things and here in the book of Philippians I want you to notice

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.160
in verse number one of chapter number two Paul says this to the church in

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.800
Philippi if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.200
love of any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies to fill ye my joy

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.960
notice what he says that you be like minded having the same love being of one

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:37.000
accord of one mind let what is the next word nothing that's a pretty significant

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.320
word is it not I mean it excludes everything right let nothing be done how

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:51.720
through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.520
better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.920
on the things of others he says let there be no strife he says this let

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.640
nothing be done through strife or vainglory we see that Abram says let

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.720
there be no strife why for we be brethren and Paul says of the believers

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.600
in Philippi he says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory we

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.720
understand this subject matter of vainglory it's the the individual

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.400
attention that is somebody wants and they want to be right they want to be

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.440
first they want to be recognized whatever the situation is and we find

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.520
here he says let nothing be done on those terms let there be no strife let

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.600
there be no vainglory he says this as we go through the passage he says look not

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.880
every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others we

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.360
speak about the importance of being a servant we speak about the importance of

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.320
recognizing the opportunities that God would give us to be a blessing to others

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:02.040
too often we get our eyes on our own lives my problem my situation my issue

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.600
my whatever and we might miss opportunities to be able to be a

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.660
blessing to be used of the Lord in somebody else's life because we're too

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.580
focused on me we're too focused on self and notice the example that Paul gives

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:26.260
in verse number five let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so he

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:32.220
uses the Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect example of this instruction is

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.140
giving here and we're familiar with the passage of Scripture here in Philippians

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.740
chapter number two he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.780
who being in the form of God thought it not robbery be equal with God he is God

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.980
incarnate the Lord Jesus Christ we understand that he says in John 17 that

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.860
that he experienced that glory that he had from the beginning he was going to

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.540
finish the work we understand that in John chapter one as John the Baptist is

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.580
there who by the way physically speaking is older than the Lord Jesus Christ

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.940
Elizabeth gave birth to John the Baptist before Mary gave birth to the Lord Jesus

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:14.460
Christ and we find that John the Baptist says that he is before me he is

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:20.220
preferred above me and we find that he's understanding the eternality of the Lord

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:26.260
Jesus Christ and he's God incarnate and he comes it says here in verse 7 but made

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:32.500
himself of no reputation and took upon the form of a servant was made in the

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:39.020
likeness of men have you really stopped and considered the truth of what the

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.060
Lord Jesus Christ did for us and leave I mean we understand Calvary and what a

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:48.180
blessing and how grateful we are we think about this truth that he left the

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.440
the glory of heaven Paul said it this way as he's speaking to the church in

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.020
Corinth and in 2nd Corinthians 8 in verse number 9 he says for you know the grace

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.860
of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:10.780
poor that ye through his poverty might be rich verse 7 but made himself of no

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.940
reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.940
men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.780
unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.860
him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.860
every knee should bow things in heaven things in earth things under the earth

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:35.620
that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:44.020
the Father Paul says let nothing be done through strife or vain glory Solomon the

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.620
one that we mentioned his wisdom that was on display in first Kings chapter

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:54.460
number three he tells us in the book of Proverbs that by pride comes contention

00:29:54.460 --> 00:30:04.180
by pride comes destruction we find that here is we would look at the truth of

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.100
of Genesis chapter number 13.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.300
And as we look at the life of Abram

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.980
as it's traced here in these verses of Scripture

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.380
and these events that are unfolding in his life,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.780
he was walking with the Lord.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.740
He was returning back to the place where God had led him.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.720
But we find that there's a problem again.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.260
Remember, there was a problem in Genesis chapter number 12.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.980
There was a great famine.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.120
And now there's a problem.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.140
There's strife between his herdmen and Lot's herdmen.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.860
And the wisdom of Abram is on display

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.260
in how he addresses that problem

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.120
and how he deals with that.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.100
We have the privilege of tracing

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.040
the steps of the life of Abraham.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.460
And we have the privilege of being able

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.220
to see much Scripture that is given to us.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.660
And as we would analyze and look at the Scriptures,

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.420
we would have the opportunities

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.560
to see the way in which he lived his life

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.820
and how we can learn lessons as we live our lives.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.560
We need wisdom.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.480
We're going to have problems.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.060
We need God's wisdom.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.220
Not only do we see the walk and wisdom of Abram,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.580
but I want you to notice his worship.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.220
It's interesting how that in Hebrews 11,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.780
this morning we dealt with the walk of Enoch

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.620
and we dealt with the worship of Abel.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.060
And here we see the walk of Abram

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.860
and the worship of Abram.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.200
But I want you to notice the Bible tells us this

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.580
in verse number 13,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.780
and then we'll get right into verses 14 through 18

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.840
and look at the worship of Abram.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.860
But notice what the Bible says,

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.860
but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.220
before the Lord exceedingly.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.940
And again, that's the place in which Lot had chosen

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.380
and pitched his tent towards Sodom.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.220
But now the Lord is going to speak to Abram.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.020
Isn't that encouraging?

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.920
I understand this morning, this evening,

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.220
I said this morning twice already, man alive.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.640
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.140
I'll blame it on that.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.260
But the reality, I had an hour nap this afternoon

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.100
in my office.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.900
I woke up and I really didn't know where I was.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.820
It was amazing.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.660
Amen.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.020
And praise the Lord.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.220
I put that recliner back and I was out.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:12.220
And anyway, the Bible says that the Lord said unto Abram,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.380
see God audibly spoke to his servants.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.660
And sometimes people today say,

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.120
I wish God would audibly speak to me.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.380
You have this book.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.760
This is the voice of God.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.160
This is God speaking to us as His people today.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.440
By the way, I understand that as we go through life,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.500
that it's very easy for us to say,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.720
well, I wish that was my situation.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.120
I wish I was over there.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.920
I would exchange these problems for those problems.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.560
Probably if you did, you'd find out that you made a mistake.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.320
Sometimes we say, man, I wish I lived in that era.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.720
I wish I lived during that time.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.440
I wish I had the experience of what these folks had.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.960
Listen, I'm thankful to live in 2020

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.040
and to have the whole Bible.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.200
What a blessing.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.600
And we find that God in His wisdom has allowed us,

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.640
ordained us to be alive today.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.000
And so we have this truth of the Word of God

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.760
and we have the very voice of God.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.640
We have the words of God.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.840
And here the Bible says the Lord said unto Abram,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.160
I wonder this evening, when you read your Bible,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.160
when you attend a church service like this,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.120
are you listening for the voice of God?

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.040
Are you looking for God to speak to you?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.400
Do we come with that expectation,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.400
with that anticipation when we enter

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.560
into our time of devotion on a daily basis?

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.280
When we come to a church service,

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.040
are we coming expecting that God is going to speak to me?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.600
Are we coming anticipating saying, Lord, I'm listening?

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.360
It's like Samuel, right?

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.520
When he goes to Eli, you've called.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.440
No, I didn't.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.520
He comes again, you call, no, I didn't.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.440
He says, here's what you do.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.080
Next time you hear it, say, speak, Lord,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.000
thy servant listens, hears.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.200
See, are we listening for the voice of God?

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.920
I had the privilege this week of speaking to someone

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.920
who I best could describe the conversation

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.840
as an individual who's hungering and thirsting

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.400
after God and after righteousness.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.120
Can I tell you, those are exciting conversations.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.160
When someone just, I mean, two hours

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.520
and 20 minutes pass like that.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.720
Why, because it's like, tell me something else.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.120
Give me some more truth.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.040
Show me this.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.080
I mean, they're hungering and thirsting

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.760
after the word of God.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.200
I love it.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.480
It's great.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.760
And I wonder in our lives, is it just a box that we check?

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.480
Read my Bible today, went to church this morning,

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.560
went to church tonight, went to the revival meeting,

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.080
checked the box.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.480
Are we coming to listen for the voice of God?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.800
God, speak to me.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.960
The Lord spoke to Abram.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.000
And notice what the Lord said in verse 14 and following.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.840
The Lord said unto Abram after that lot

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.280
was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.840
and look from the place where thou art.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.840
Northward, southward, eastward, and westward.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.120
In other words, he says, look everywhere,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.040
in every direction.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.040
From the place where you are, look in every direction.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.040
That's what God tells him.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.400
And then God says this.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.400
For all the land which thou seest,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.280
to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.520
That's a great promise, is it not?

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.840
The promise of God to Abram with regard to the land.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.600
We find that it's not only the land, but it's the seed.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.200
We find that he says that the land which thou seest,

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.200
to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.360
And I will, notice where he says,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.240
I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.720
so that if a man can number the dust of the earth,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.600
then shall thy seed also be numbered by the way.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.160
We're familiar with Abraham and Sarah.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.960
Now, Abram and Sarai, do they have any seed?

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.280
No!

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.080
Sarai, the Bible tells us in chapter number 11,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.520
she's barren.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.160
And yet, God is giving this promise

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.000
about the blessing, not only of the land, but the seed.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.160
By the way, they're both elevated in years, shall we say?

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.040
But God's making a promise.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.880
Can I tell you this evening

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.000
that when God makes a promise, it's sure.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.240
We can stand upon it.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.040
We sing the song, by the way, standing on the promises.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.440
I cannot fall, right?

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.680
The songwriter says.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.520
And we think about the promises of God.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.680
Peter says that they're exceeding precious,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.880
great and precious promises.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.600
We get into the word of God and we study it and we say,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.320
God, you have some promises for me today.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.840
He does.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.120
Look for them.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.600
Search them out.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.520
Reclaim them.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.880
The promises of God.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.720
He says, I'm gonna give you a land.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.480
I'm gonna bless your seed.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.720
Notice in verse 17, he continues,

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.160
God speaking to Abram and says,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.440
arise, walk through the land in the length of it

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.440
and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.280
We're speaking about the worship of God.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.040
We're noticing the way in which Abram

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.720
would worship the Lord.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.240
But in verses 14 through 17, we're really seeing

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.040
the way in which God is speaking to Abram.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.440
But the response of this promise,

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.880
the response to this promise,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.320
the response of Abram is to worship the Lord.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.840
To worship the Lord.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.360
We see in verse number 18,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.960
it says, then Abram removed his tent.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.800
The idea of that phraseology that we find

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.160
in verse number 17, God's instruction was,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.280
arise, walk through the land in the length of it

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.320
and the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.920
And so the idea of then Abram removed his tent

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.600
is that he began to journey and moving his tent with them

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.320
as he was going through the land.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.960
And he's moving and he's taking, making progress,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.600
following what God said in verse number 17.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.280
And he kept moving along the way, staking his claim,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.800
believing the promise of God.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.640
Faith.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.800
And it says this,

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.640
and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre,

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.360
which is in Hebron, and notice,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.760
and built there an altar unto the Lord.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.240
It is said on a number of occasions about Abram

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.160
that he built an altar unto the Lord.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.800
We read it on a number of occasions in chapter number 12.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.280
We read in chapter 13 and verse number four

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.200
how that he came to the place which he had made there

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.640
at the first and there that altar that he made.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.840
Remember in verse number three,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.320
it says that he came to a place where his tent

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.680
had been at the beginning between Bethel and Ai.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.160
And we find that there he had built that altar.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.360
And here the Bible says in verse number four

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.720
that Abram called on the name of the Lord.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.880
He did that back in chapter number 12

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.000
as we found record of that in verse number eight.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.400
And now we see in chapter number 13 and verse number four

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.640
and in verse number 18,

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.680
there he built an altar unto the Lord.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.160
He's worshiping the Lord.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.120
See, Abram is living during the era of Israel's history

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.280
where there is no tabernacle.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.560
That's not gonna come for a long period of time.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.800
There is no temple that's even further out in the distance.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.640
And so what did Abram do?

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.920
Built an altar.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.120
By the way, that's what Noah did after he got off the ark.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.120
We spoke about that this morning as well.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.120
that he built an altar and he called upon the Lord and he's worshiping the Lord.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.080
So we think about the promises of God and we think about

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.840
the way in which God is giving and speaking to Abram

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.040
here in this passage of Scripture in verses 14 through 17.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.440
The natural response is to worship the Lord.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:27.680
To worship Him. This evening as we would take the passage of Scripture that is

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.240
before us and we would consider the walk and the wisdom and

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.920
the worship of Abram, I wonder as we walk with God,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.560
are we daily walking with Him like we should be? Are we in the place where

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.160
we're supposed to be? Are we asking God and depending on God

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.880
for the wisdom that we need for the the problems that we face in life?

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.240
There will be problems. There are problems.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:03.120
Right? We need God's wisdom and we see that Abram, we notice his

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.080
wisdom on display here in the passage. But how thankful I am for how the

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.600
Lord spoke to him. You understand that God didn't speak to Lot in this

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:17.680
fashion, in this manner. See, Lot chose something based upon

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.840
sight. He lifted up his eyes and he saw this and he...

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.280
By the way, he's pitched towards Sodom. We said already that the men

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.200
of that city were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.720
He'd soon be influenced by them. But as Abram made that decision, he made

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.160
that proposal and he told Lot, you choose and I'll go the

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.000
other way. And then the Lord spoke to him. He says,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.480
look at every direction. I'm going to give you this land. I'm

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.720
going to bless your seed. And what does he do? He

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.000
worships. Can I tell you this morning? Oh man, this

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.720
evening? Can I tell you tonight? Listen, three times. Man, alive.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.040
Can I tell you this evening? That we need to worship God.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.720
Listen, when you approach the Word of God and He speaks to you

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.920
and He gives you some promises, oh would you just worship Him?

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.720
You know, what a joy it is to just get in His presence for a little while.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.120
Not necessarily to ask for anything. Just to worship Him.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.480
Just to praise Him for who He is. Just to thank Him for giving you a Bible.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.880
For giving you a church where you can go and

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.400
hear the Word of God. For giving you an opportunity to receive

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.680
the promises of God. To be in a place where you've been

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.320
aware of who He is. How He's revealed Himself to you.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.600
Oh, you just get in His presence a little while and you begin to

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.320
just get filled with God and stand in awe of who He is.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.840
You begin to worship. It's amazing how you find yourself in that place and

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.160
how God will bless. And how God will come and commune with

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.120
you. And how He will meet the needs of

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.680
each of us, His people. He's a God who is able.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.000
This evening we see that Abram, the passage finishes with him

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.880
worshiping. With him worshiping the Lord. Building an altar.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.560
We see his walk. We see his wisdom. We see his worship. This evening, oh that we'd

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.040
walk with God. Oh that we'd ask God, recognize that we

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.080
need His wisdom. Get into the book and worship Him. He is

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.320
worthy of our worship. Let's pray. Father, we love you.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.840
We thank you so much for loving us.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:48.240
We thank you for who you are. You are the Lord God Omnipotent.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.160
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty. In just a little while,

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.320
in Bible history, from the place where we are this evening, you will reveal

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:03.040
yourself to Abraham as El Shaddai, Lord God Almighty.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.600
We thank you that you've given us your Word.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.280
And then on a regular basis, as often as we please, we can

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.640
enter into your presence. Dig into your Word.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.520
Commune with you.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:30.880
The thought of that calls us to rejoice.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:39.200
That we could be in your presence. We thank you that you spoke to Abraham.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.640
We thank you this evening that we have the entirety of the Bible and that you

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.640
still speak to us today. And God, I pray that you'd help us to

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.480
listen for your voice. I pray that you'd help us to

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.440
enter our daily time with you in each church service that we attend.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.320
Anticipate and expecting that you're going to speak to us.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.240
Help us to receive and claim the promises. Help us, Lord, to worship you,

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.920
for you are worthy of our worship.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.680
Lord, I pray this evening that we've been challenged and encouraged by the

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.480
opportunity to study these events in the life of Abraham.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.600
Perhaps there are some this evening that have some

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.280
problems that they're facing in life. They need your wisdom.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.720
God, would you help us, as Solomon did, to humble ourselves.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.600
To recognize that you are the all-wise God and that you've promised to give us

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.120
wisdom if we simply ask.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.040
Help us to humble ourselves and to acknowledge our need.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.840
And God, we trust you to give us the wisdom that we need to

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:58.000
navigate this life and to address problems that will arise. I pray, God, that

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.960
you would work in hearts and lives that decisions would be made that would

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.200
please thee and we'll thank you for it. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.880
eyes are closed. Holly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.360
As she does, we'll have a time of invitation, opportunity for you to

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.800
respond. Maybe you just want to thank God. Maybe

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.200
you want to ask him for wisdom. Maybe there's some problems you're dealing

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.920
with in life.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.080
And you just want to come and worship the Lord a little bit this evening.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.120
Thank him for speaking to you. Thank him for

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:40.000
allowing you to enter into his presence. As Holly plays, the altar is open.
