1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
1 Samuel this morning, and my heart was blessed.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,400
I trust that you had sweet time with the Lord this morning as well, and what a blessing

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,119
it is to enter into His presence.

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,359
What a joy that we have the Word of God, and God uses His Word in our hearts and our lives,

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,360
amen?

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,340
And there are many things that are seeking to influence the heart and mind of the people

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,399
of God, and God's given us this precious book, and oh, how wonderful it is.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,620
The Bible says of itself that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it tells

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,779
us that it's profitable, and you know, it's profitable when we're reading it, when we're

10
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,740
obeying it, amen?

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,419
And we're to be doers of the Word and not hearers only, and I'm so thankful for this

12
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,819
precious book.

13
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:46,520
Last week, you'll remember that we finished up Colossians chapter number 1, and as we

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,299
read through the last portion of this passage of Scripture and studied those verses of Scripture,

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:57,139
we understood that Paul was giving a description of the ministry in which God had called him

16
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,540
to.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:04,300
The Apostle Paul had suffered adversity, in fact, he speaks specifically about the sufferings

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
that he was currently enduring.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,739
We understand that at the time of the writing, the Apostle Paul is in prison, and yet he

20
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,500
remained faithful to the call of God upon his life, and he had a desire to finish his

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
race.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,540
And we understand that Paul says to the believers, really the elders in Ephesus, as he calls

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,300
them to meet him on his way to Jerusalem.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,940
It's recorded for us in Acts chapter number 20 that he had this desire, that he would

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,099
finish his course with joy.

26
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,699
And Paul understood that he had been given a stewardship, a responsibility.

27
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:49,620
It's referred to in verse 25 as the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you.

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:56,620
And what a blessing to see how the Apostle Paul desired to finish his race, to do that

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,980
which God had called him to do.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,819
No doubt in my mind it is the believers in Colossae read this first chapter, and we understand

31
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:09,300
the chapter divisions were added far later than when they actually received the letter.

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,419
But in our study of the book of Colossians, when they've come to this point, which we

33
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:20,139
are, there's no doubt in my mind that they have been able to easily tell the difference

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,300
between the philosophy of the Apostle Paul and that of the false teachers.

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,740
You'll remember that Paul never physically ministered in Colossae.

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,139
He did not know these people personally.

37
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:38,179
They did not know him personally, yet he desired to share with them truth, and he understood

38
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:44,740
that the enemy using false teachers was active in the city of Colossae.

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,539
And so Paul is sharing some philosophy with them.

40
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,220
You'll recall with me that he mentions in verse number 28 of chapter number one the

41
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,539
three aspects of ministry.

42
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,979
If he were to give an overview of the ministry that God called him to, he says, number one,

43
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,520
we preach Christ.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,660
He says it this way, whom we preach, but we understand contextually, as you finish verse

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,419
number 27, he says, Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach.

46
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,500
First aspect of the ministry of the Apostle Paul was preaching Christ.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,100
By the way, isn't that a wonderful opportunity that we have to preach Christ?

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,759
To let people know about the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he's done for us and that which

49
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,300
he would do for them.

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,860
We find that he then continues and says this, warning every man.

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Warning every man.

52
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:37,139
And what's interesting is when we enter into the second chapter, you don't get far before

53
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,580
you find in verse number eight that he uses the word, beware.

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,699
Remember, he shared with them in chapter number one this philosophy of ministry and explaining

55
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,580
to them the approach to ministry.

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,059
He's preaching Christ, he's warning every man, and then he says this, number three,

57
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,660
teaching every man.

58
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,059
What a joy it is to teach the word of God.

59
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,139
The Bible says that the entrance of thy words, it giveth light.

60
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,139
And I'm so thankful for the power of the word of God.

61
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,100
And we understand that we have an enemy that seeks to blind the hearts and minds of the

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,380
people of the world.

63
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,339
And we find that the word of God is that which giveth light.

64
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:20,260
And I'm so thankful that we have the privilege of being able to teach the word of God.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,420
And he says this as he shares the philosophy of ministry and describes the ministry in

66
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,980
these three ways.

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,779
He gives to these believers in Colossae the goal or purpose of ministry.

68
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:39,140
And we find that at the end of verse number 28, that we may present every man perfect

69
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,019
in Christ Jesus.

70
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,179
What a great goal.

71
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:46,820
What a great desire that Paul has for these believers in Colossae.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,140
And we find that as he would share these things and give this truth to these believers, there's

73
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,940
no doubt in my mind that as they read about the love and concern that Paul has for them,

74
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,420
as they read about the way in which Paul was praying for them, people that he had never met,

75
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,859
yet he's praying for them always, he says.

76
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:13,100
And he exalts Christ and he explains the ministry.

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,700
As we enter into chapter number 2, we find that Paul continues to express his love and

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,100
concern for these believers in Colossae.

79
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,179
You understand that Paul was not seeking to get anything from these believers.

80
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:31,320
He was not seeking to increase some kingdom for himself.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,899
He was not seeking some accolades, recognition, any type of monetary gains.

82
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,619
He was not seeking that.

83
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:42,260
He was simply desiring to be a blessing to these believers.

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,100
It reminds me of what Paul would say to the believers in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 12, 14 and 15.

85
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,339
It's not the entirety of either one of those verses, but you find that Paul says this to

86
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:58,660
the believers in Corinth, I seek not yours, but you.

87
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:08,019
And then he says this, I will very gladly spend and be spent for you.

88
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:13,739
Is that not a great contrast to the philosophy and approach of false teachers?

89
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:19,459
We find that here as we enter into Colossians chapter number 2, that Paul says this, notice

90
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:28,179
with me in verse number 1, for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you

91
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:34,459
and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, that

92
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,899
their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the

93
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:46,260
full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and

94
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:53,940
of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

95
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,179
We'll stop there this morning.

96
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,140
We'll just look at the first three verses of Colossians 2.

97
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,940
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message, Paul's Great Conflict.

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,140
Paul's Great Conflict.

99
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,380
Notice with me, if you're taking notes, number 1, Paul reveals the conflict that he has for

100
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,779
these believers.

101
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:15,700
We find that as you begin reading in verse number 1, that Paul has a desire that these

102
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,500
believers in Colossae would have a knowledge and an understanding of that which he was

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,540
calling a great conflict.

104
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,299
Really we would understand this morning that Paul was so deeply concerned for these believers

105
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:38,660
that the way in which he described that deep concern was that he had a great conflict.

106
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,059
Now we're familiar with conflicts.

107
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:46,260
In fact, we live in a time and an era in which very few people understand anything about

108
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,339
conflict resolution.

109
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,779
We find that we live, and we have experienced, if you have lived for any length of time,

110
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,579
you've experienced conflict.

111
00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:02,260
We find that Paul is describing for these believers in Colossae this conflict that he

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,899
has, really it's an internal conflict that he's dealing with, and yes, there are some

113
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:13,660
external things that would lend to and lead to the conflict that Paul was experiencing,

114
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,059
but he says to these believers in Colossae, that I want you to know, for I would that

115
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:22,859
ye knew what great conflict I have for you.

116
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:28,500
I believe that as we begin to read this portion of Scripture and have the opportunity to kind

117
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,500
of see the heart of the Apostle Paul a little bit here, we see other glimpses into the heart

118
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,099
of the Apostle Paul when he says in Romans 9 and Romans 10 that his heart's desire for

119
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,140
his kinsmen, his brethren, according to the flesh, is that they might be saved.

120
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:54,820
And Paul is sharing here, he's allowing the believers in Colossae to see the heart of

121
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
a spiritual leader.

122
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,059
The heart of one that has this great concern, this great, as he describes it, conflict for

123
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,539
these believers.

124
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,739
We find that this concern that Paul had, this conflict that he would reveal to these believers

125
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:15,460
in Colossae, you'll understand as you read the entirety of verse number one, that it

126
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,020
was not simply for the brethren in Colossae.

127
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:26,059
He says this, for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them

128
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:34,299
at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh.

129
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:40,260
I want you to consider that these two cities that are mentioned specifically, Colossae

130
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,260
and Laodicea, we understand that Colossae is not mentioned here in verse number one,

131
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,419
but he says for you, and we understand the book is written to the believers in Colossae,

132
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,280
and so we'd understand that he mentions these two cities, Colossae and Laodicea.

133
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,760
They're separated by about 11 miles, but it would seem as we'll continue our study

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,039
this morning that those false teachers that were there in...

135
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,459
Colossae have also had some level of influence there in Laodicea. He says not

136
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,219
only is he concerned about these particular churches that are established

137
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:14,899
in these regions, in these locations, but he says, and for as many as have not seen

138
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,699
my face in the flesh. You understand that as you trace the steps of the

139
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,939
Apostle Paul throughout the book of Acts, and then as you study the epistles that

140
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:27,899
God would allow him to pen, you'll find that the Apostle Paul had much

141
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:34,219
opportunity, had several areas in which he traveled and saw churches

142
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:38,419
established. The first missionary journey that he took as he went into the

143
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,259
regions of Galatia, there were no less than four churches that were started as

144
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:48,219
a result of that one single missionary journey. But you understand that from

145
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:52,579
these churches there were other churches that were established. When Paul would

146
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,779
write to the church in Thessalonica, a church in which he was able to enter

147
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,919
into that city and see a church established in short order, you would

148
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,819
find that Paul, as he writes back to that church, he commends them in 1st

149
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:13,619
Thessalonians 1, that from them went forth, sounded forth, the gospel. So the

150
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:19,339
gospel's spreading. And so Paul was keenly aware of the fact that the

151
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:26,259
truth of God's Word and the expansion of biblical Christianity was not just the

152
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:31,459
people that he had personally ministered among. There were others that

153
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:37,579
had not yet seen his face, and Paul has a concern for those believers as well. And

154
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:46,299
Paul is sharing this truth, and he says, I would that ye knew what great conflict

155
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,939
I have for you and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face

156
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,019
in the flesh. Turn over if you will, hold your place here, but look over at 2nd

157
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,699
Corinthians chapter number 11. I want you to see how Paul words it here to the

158
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:06,339
church in Corinth, really a similar truth that is being revealed here to us. We

159
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,259
find that the Apostle Paul is writing to these that he ministered among. You

160
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,539
understand that he served in Corinth for a lengthy period of time, perhaps one of

161
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:21,179
the longest durations of his ministry, and God blessed and worked, but of course

162
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,819
we know that there was much division and contention within the church in Corinth,

163
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:29,099
and he writes these letters, and we find that Paul in chapter number 11 of 2nd

164
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:35,539
Corinthians is describing several things that he had endured. We find that Paul

165
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:41,779
goes through, beginning in verse number 23, he says, Are they ministers of Christ? I

166
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,979
speak as a fool, I am more. In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in

167
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:52,379
prisons more frequent, in deaths oft of the Jews. Five times received I forty

168
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,939
stripes, save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I

169
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:02,779
suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I have been in the deep. In journeyings

170
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,979
often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen,

171
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:12,979
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in

172
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:17,059
perils in the sea, in perils among the brethren, in weariness and painfulness,

173
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,979
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

174
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:28,859
Now when you read that list, you say, most of us have not experienced anything like

175
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:33,659
that. Amen? But you know what Paul says about those things, and I'm not even to

176
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,179
the really the climax of what I want to get to there in 2nd Corinthians 11, but

177
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:42,299
if you think back to chapter number 4 of the same book, Paul says this. Now he

178
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,499
describes in detail all of these things that I just read to you in chapter

179
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:51,779
number 11. In chapter number 4, he just calls them the things. Notice here, he

180
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,779
says, for which cause we faint not, in chapter 4 and verse number 16, but

181
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,299
through, excuse me, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed

182
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:06,979
day by day, for our light affliction. Did you hear all of those things that he

183
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:13,419
mentioned in chapter number 11? Would you describe that as light affliction?

184
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:24,499
Paul says our light affliction is but for a moment, but for a moment, worketh

185
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:36,019
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the

186
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:41,219
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which

187
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:47,019
are seen are temporal. The things which are not seen are eternal. Paul had a good

188
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,379
perspective on life, did he not? He says our light affliction, which is but for a

189
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:58,899
moment. Paul was looking to eternity, and he suffered all these things, but I want

190
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,539
you to notice what he says back in chapter 11 in verse number 28. He says

191
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:15,299
this, beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, notice what

192
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:25,419
he says, the care of all the churches. The care of all the churches. This morning as

193
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:31,519
I see the heart of the Apostle Paul in Colossians chapter number 2, in saying to these believers

194
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,679
in Colossae that I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them

195
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:45,439
at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. He summarizes it in

196
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:53,359
2 Corinthians 11.28 and says that it's the care of all the churches. This morning as

197
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:58,719
I read, as I've studied throughout the period of time as I've prepared this message and

198
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,479
I've read the book of Colossians dozens of times last year and the last quarter just

199
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:08,759
in preparation for this study, I don't know how many times I've read the book of Colossians,

200
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:15,479
but I know that as I come to this first verse of chapter number 2, I once again am seeing

201
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:22,559
and realizing the passion that Paul had and the sincerity, the transparency that he's

202
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:33,419
sharing with those in which he seeks to minister. As a spiritual leader, the care of one church,

203
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:40,919
one body of believers, it's significant. It's serious. And we find that Paul is saying,

204
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:49,039
I want you to know what great conflict I have. This conflict that he has, as I mentioned

205
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:57,359
already, he's so deeply concerned for them that he calls it a great conflict. As a pastor,

206
00:16:57,359 --> 00:17:01,719
as you study the book of Hebrews as we did last year, you find in chapter number 13 that

207
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:08,639
the Bible describes one aspect of the responsibility of the pastor as one that watches for your

208
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:19,959
soul. Wow. It's a serious responsibility. And this morning, a true spiritual leader

209
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:28,019
will take seriously the responsibility of the call that God has placed upon their lives.

210
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,279
We find this morning that Paul says, I want to reveal something to you. I want to reveal

211
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,239
this great conflict that I have. As we continue and move through the passage of Scripture

212
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:44,159
here in Colossians 2, we consider, number two, the reason for this conflict. What was

213
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:51,559
the reason that Paul had to lead to this great conflict that he refers to in verse number

214
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,399
1? He says that it's for those that are in Colossae, for those that are in Laodicea,

215
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,639
for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. Why is it? What is the reason? What

216
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:07,159
has led Paul to this great conflict? Well, I believe that as you study the entirety of

217
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,359
the book of Colossians, as you study the whole of Scripture, that you would say very

218
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,559
simply this, it was the fact that the enemy was active. It was the fact that false teaching

219
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:22,859
was prevalent. It was the fact that Paul had gone and preached the Gospel and those that

220
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,479
had been saved take the Gospel far and wide and they seek to reach the world with the

221
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,719
Gospel of Jesus Christ and many have been saved. And the Bible says of those in the

222
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:39,000
book of Acts and Paul and all of the missionary journeys that they that have turned the world

223
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
upside down have come here. I mean, the Word of God was marching forward and God was blessing

224
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,719
and working, but we find that the enemy is always active. The enemy is always active.

225
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:56,799
And it was the activity of the enemy, it was the false teaching that was prevalent, not

226
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,599
only in Colossae, but had affected those in Laodicea, no doubt had affected many other

227
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:08,000
congregations throughout the known world at that point. And Paul says it's because of

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,959
this activity, it's because of this false teaching that my heart, that I'm burdened,

229
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:20,959
that I'm concerned that I have this great conflict. We find that it was there in Colossae

230
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:28,199
the enemy would use deception and false teaching and we find that the enemy would seek to these

231
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:34,320
Gnostics that were active there in Colossae. One of their approaches would be that of this

232
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,159
high intellect. And they would speak often about wisdom and knowledge and they would

233
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,559
speak about mysteries and the way in which you could attain some spiritual level of some

234
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,880
mystery and some knowledge that was held back from others. Thus, you find so often that

235
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Paul would use those same terminologies here in the book of Colossians as he's ministering

236
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,079
to these believers in Colossae.

237
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:06,079
Colossi to help them understand that it is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

238
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,399
Remember back in chapter 1 in verse number 27, to whom God would make known

239
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,079
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is

240
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:22,339
Christ in you, the hope of glory. He'll say in verse number 3 of this chapter 2,

241
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:30,539
in whom, speaking of Christ, are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

242
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:36,339
These false teachers that were active in Colossi, they often would use this thing

243
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:40,259
of intellect and they would speak of some wisdom or knowledge. I am thankful

244
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,939
that Paul is writing Scripture, that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

245
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:50,819
I'm thankful today that we have the whole of God's Word and we have the

246
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:57,539
wisdom of God, the mind of Christ. And what a joy it is for us to know the

247
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,259
truth of the Word of God and that we can take the truth of God's Word and we can,

248
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:09,099
as John said in 1 John, try the spirits because we have the Word of God.

249
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:14,299
You hear some teaching, you hear someone come in with some, man they sound good,

250
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,679
they're eloquent, and they use these big words and this great vocabulary. Be

251
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:27,439
careful not to be awed by that. Check them to the Scriptures. Amen? I don't care

252
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:31,479
how many letters somebody has after their name, before their name, it matters

253
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:38,399
not if they do not agree with what thus saith the Lord. Amen? If we're not careful,

254
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:43,159
you get on some internet site, you get some YouTube something or whatever, you

255
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,559
say, oh but this person has a doctorate in this and they have a this and a that.

256
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:55,839
Be careful. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. Romans chapter

257
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:05,039
number one. Teaching must match this book. What was the tactic of the enemy in

258
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,679
Laodicea? You know, it actually was different than what it was in Colossae.

259
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,679
Turn over to Revelation, if you will, chapter number three. We'll be back there

260
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,839
to the book of Colossians in just a moment, but I want you to see that God

261
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,879
has given us, the Bible's awesome, I love the Word of God, there's not much that we

262
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:28,879
know about this church in Laodicea. However, we find that God, as He would

263
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:33,119
give John the responsibility of these letters that are recorded in the book of

264
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,759
Revelation to these seven churches in Asia, that the last of these letters is

265
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,639
written to the church that Paul would reference here in Colossians chapter

266
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,479
number two. He says, listen, I'm not only concerned for those, for you, those in

267
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:51,639
Colossae, but those that are in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face. And

268
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:55,279
as you come to Revelation chapter number three, beginning in verse number 14, you

269
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,959
find that this letter to this church is written. I have referred to this church

270
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:06,439
in the past as being the rich, poor church. There's a previous church that I

271
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:11,119
referred to, that in Philadelphia, as the weak, strong church. And we find that it

272
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,079
was the church in Smyrna that is the poor church, but they were rich in Christ.

273
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,079
We find that it was just church in Laodicea that the Bible calls this

274
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:27,159
church in verse number 14, and unto the angel, notice what it says, of the church

275
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,639
of the Laodiceans. It's very interesting because each of the previous six

276
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:38,039
letters that are written to these churches are all addressed to the church

277
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:44,719
in whatever the city is. But here, the Bible says that it's the church of the

278
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:51,479
Laodiceans. It says, write these things, saith the Amen, the faithful and true

279
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:56,599
witness, the beginning of the creation of God. Verse 15, I know thy works. Thou art

280
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,119
neither cold nor hot. I would thou work cold or hot. So then, because thou art

281
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,679
lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Notice verse

282
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:15,319
17, because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of

283
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:24,639
nothing. I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing. In Laodicea,

284
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:31,579
they were dealing with this level of self-sufficiency, plenty, wealth. When it

285
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,919
says here that they have need of nothing, really, as you study the entirety of

286
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,639
this passage, you would find that they almost came to the point they didn't

287
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:45,599
think they needed God either. They were self-sufficient. They had plenty. The

288
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,919
continuation of verse number 17, it says this, and knowest not. You know, we can

289
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,439
have our perspective, but God has His perspective. Typically, we'd like to

290
00:24:56,439 --> 00:25:02,159
describe ourselves in better terms than God would describe us. Is it not true? And

291
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,879
God says in verse number 17, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable

292
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:17,519
and poor and blind and naked. Wow, that's a different description than what they

293
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:24,159
had of themselves, is it not? Because thou sayest, here's what you say, here's what

294
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,679
God says. You find that the Bible says in verse number 19, as many as I love, I

295
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,759
rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Notice verse 20. Behold, I

296
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,359
stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will

297
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:47,079
come into him and will sup with him and he with me. I know that often Revelation

298
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,039
3 and verse number 20, people will use that verse of Scripture as they try to

299
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,559
share the gospel with individuals, but the true context of this verse of

300
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,839
Scripture is written to the church of the Laodiceans. Jesus said, I will build

301
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,999
my church, and yet this church of the Laodiceans, the picture that we see in

302
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:13,519
verse number 20 is that Christ is on the outside of his church, knocking to get in.

303
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:22,159
Wow. See, the enemy was active in Colossae through the Gnostics and through their

304
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:26,839
level of intellect and wisdom and all of these things that they would speak of,

305
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:33,319
and really causing the people to really struggle and sway back and forth,

306
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,999
and in Laodicea, the enemy was working in a different manner. He was

307
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,199
saying, hey, you guys, you're good, man, you have all of this wealth, you don't

308
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:52,319
need this stuff. There's a danger in becoming self-sufficient, independent.

309
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:58,119
The Word of God tells us that Jesus said, I am the vine, you're the branches.

310
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:09,479
Without me, ye can do nothing. We need him, and here we find, as we look back to the

311
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,839
book of Colossians and consider the reason for this conflict that Paul is

312
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,599
describing in verse number one, we will remember that the enemy is subtle and

313
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,919
crafty. We'd understand that Paul would warn the believers in Ephesus and

314
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,279
instruct them to put on the whole armor of God, to go in the power and the

315
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,599
strength of God. Why? That they may be able to stand against the wiles of the

316
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:40,079
devil, his trickery, his craftiness, his deceit. We find that the approach of the

317
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,279
enemy will vary, but I'm thankful that we're not ignorant of his devices. You

318
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,519
read the Word of God, and you read the entirety of God's Word, and you will find

319
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,439
many examples of how the enemy works. You will find in ways in which the

320
00:27:56,439 --> 00:28:02,999
enemy works in very deceitful means. He comes and speaks as if he's going to be

321
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:07,639
one of you. In fact, Jude warns of that very thing, that the reason that he's

322
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:13,599
writing that short but powerful epistle is that there were certain men that

323
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:21,639
crept in unawares, that had turned the grace of God into lasciviousness. And

324
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:26,279
Jude is writing that short epistle to the people of God to warn them about

325
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,199
these false teachers that had crept into the church. We want to see the

326
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:35,319
church grow, and it's a blessing to see the church grow, but oh, how we need to be

327
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:41,519
careful that we are mindful of the fact that the enemy does work, and he works in

328
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,879
such a way as that he'd like to infiltrate the church of God. We find

329
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:57,679
that the enemy is tricky, he's crafty, he's subtle. This morning as we think

330
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,519
about these two illustrations or examples that God gives us from His Word

331
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,399
with regard to these two churches in particular, we find that today the enemy

332
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,119
is still working. The enemy is working. In fact, the book of Revelation teaches us

333
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,239
that he knows that this time is short. I believe that we're living in the last

334
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:24,559
days, and I believe that it's almost kind of like that full-court press, if you

335
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,799
could use a basketball analogy. Satan's trying to pull out all the stops, if you

336
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,759
will, and he's working, he's active. We find that he's working today, he's seeking, I

337
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,919
believe, to separate and divide the people of God. You see the division in

338
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,919
the church in Corinth, and you see how that he was using various tactics there,

339
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,199
and he was seeking to divide those individuals. We find that the enemy, he'll

340
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:55,519
use all sorts of means, I mentioned a moment ago, about being careful of those

341
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,039
false teachers that abound. It's amazing.

342
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:06,399
how much information is at the fingertips of our people today. It really

343
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,799
is, it's amazing. Can I tell you that most of that which you would find on the

344
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:18,439
internet, I'd be careful of. I would be very careful. I warn you, that's what Paul

345
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:25,079
said, I'm warning every man. There's a lot of false teaching out there, a lot of it.

346
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:30,839
It's prevalent. And again, you understand that people will use this kind of thing,

347
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:38,119
well look at how many followers they have. I mean they must be right. People

348
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:45,439
think that way. Honestly, people think that way. There are many false teachers.

349
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:50,879
The enemy is active, he's working. I'm thankful that God is working and that

350
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:55,519
God is greater. But we understand that Paul says, here's the reason for this

351
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,959
conflict. It really, as you look at the whole book, he doesn't lay it out in

352
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:02,839
simple words in verse number one as to the real reason, but as you study the

353
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,559
entirety of the book, you'd understand that the reason that Paul has this

354
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,399
conflict is because of the false teachers that are active in all that is

355
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,319
taking place and how that they're seeking to destroy, the enemy is seeking

356
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,999
to destroy and to devour. You understand that the enemy, that he's a liar. John

357
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,719
says this in John 8 and verse number 44 as Jesus is speaking and he's speaking

358
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:29,439
to these religious leaders and he says, you're of your father the devil and the

359
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:33,159
lust of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode

360
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,879
not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he

361
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:43,479
speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it. I know that I've often

362
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:47,479
said that false teachers, one of the things that we need to be so careful of

363
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:53,079
and we need discernment, we need wisdom from God, is that they will use our

364
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,799
vocabulary but they mean something entirely different and it just takes a

365
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,559
little bit of digging to find out what they really mean and oh they will use

366
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,879
terms that perhaps you've heard and you've been familiar with but they mean

367
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,759
something entirely different and we need to be careful. We need to understand the

368
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,519
enemy is active and Paul says this is the reason that I have this conflict. As

369
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,599
we look at verses 2 and 3 this morning of Colossians chapter number 2, I would

370
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:29,279
say this, I would consider number 3, how to resolve this conflict. I understand

371
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,799
that the conflict will never completely be resolved until Jesus returns, until we

372
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,719
get to be with him for all of eternity because the enemy, until he is banished,

373
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:42,279
until even during the millennial reign of Christ, he's banished and he's bound

374
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,719
for that thousand years but then he's loosed for a little season and the Bible

375
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:49,359
tells us there's one final revolt but then in Revelation chapter number 20 in

376
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,599
verse number 10 he is cast in the lake of fire and he will burn, he'll be

377
00:32:52,599 --> 00:33:02,319
tormented day and night forever and ever. But I believe for Paul, I would say for

378
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,879
myself as a spiritual leader, as I try to understand the heart of Paul and I can

379
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,759
can really relate to Paul in the conflict that he's sharing in the great

380
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,679
concern, I can relate to understanding that which he's dealing with and

381
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,759
understanding as being an under shepherd and having the responsibility of being a

382
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,159
pastor and watching for the souls of those that God would entrust and feeding

383
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,119
the flock of God and understanding the way in which the false teachers are

384
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:36,079
active, I can relate to Paul. And I say as I look at verses 2 and 3 as Paul is

385
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,159
really explaining what his desire is for these believers in Colossae, no

386
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,799
doubt for those in Laodicea and for as many as have not seen his face as well,

387
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:52,319
we'd find that it would help to resolve this conflict at least at this level. I

388
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,799
would say to you this morning that spiritual growth is the best way to

389
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,919
combat false teaching. Spiritual growth is the best way to combat false teaching,

390
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:09,799
knowing the truth. Listen to what Peter says in 2nd Peter 3 in verses 17 and 18.

391
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,999
Peter says this and often we quote verse number 18 but he says in 2nd Peter 3

392
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:18,799
in verse number 17 as he finishes the short epistle, writing to these

393
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:23,119
believers that had been scattered abroad but he speaks to them in chapter 2 about

394
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,199
the false teachers that were among them and he says this in 2nd Peter 3 in

395
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:36,879
verse 17, ye therefore beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware, lest ye

396
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,359
also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own

397
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:48,759
steadfastness. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior

398
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:56,199
Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen. What is Peter saying?

399
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,919
Those false teachers are around. They're gonna always be around and so what's the

400
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:05,559
best way to combat that false teaching? To grow spiritually. We have the Word of

401
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,159
God. We have the truth. Jesus said in John 17, sanctify them through Thy Word.

402
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:16,519
Thy Word is truth. Aren't you thankful we have the Bible? I mean it gives us the

403
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,639
truth that we need. It gives us the ability to grow. He told them in 1st

404
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,679
Peter chapter number 2 in verse number 2, as newborn babes desire the sincere

405
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,879
milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby. It's that spiritual growth. Notice what Paul

406
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:38,839
says back in Colossians 2 in verse number 2. As he's expressing his desire

407
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:45,679
for these believers that I believe would lead to the resolving of this conflict

408
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,959
that he was dealing with, it says that their hearts, number 1 in verse number 2

409
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:54,799
there, that their hearts might be comforted. That their hearts might be

410
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,679
comforted. This word comfort is an interesting word. We're familiar with the

411
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:03,359
understand the Holy Spirit is the comforter, that our God is the God of all

412
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,599
comfort. It means to console. It also carries with it the idea of to encourage

413
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,559
and strengthen by consolation. I would believe that as I look at this passage

414
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:17,319
of Scripture and read these words that their hearts might be comforted. That

415
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:22,319
there was some level because of the activity of the false teachers that

416
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,199
there was some level of chaos and confusion. There was perhaps some anxiety

417
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,919
that was taking place and you understand that Paul is saying here

418
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:38,599
that he is desiring that their hearts might be comforted. You think about the

419
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:46,839
listen false teachers are they're persistent. We know something about our

420
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:58,119
enemy he's persistent is he not? He tempted the Lord Jesus Christ, God. He

421
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,799
tempted him in the wilderness. You read the passage of Scripture and it says

422
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:10,479
that he departed for a little season. Listen the enemy is persistent. You read

423
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:17,159
through the book of Nehemiah, Ezra. Read about the enemy in those books. I mean

424
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,039
it's persistent right? The enemy is persistent and the false teachers not

425
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,999
only they're persistent but they're persuasive. They're persistent and

426
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:32,079
they're persuasive. Think about all the way back in Genesis chapter number three.

427
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:43,039
The serpent, the most subtle beast. The Bible says this, yea hath God said. Do you

428
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:50,039
not think that he the enemy was persuasive in the garden? To persuade Eve

429
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:57,999
to partake of that fruit. He takes and he says look it's it's good for you. I mean

430
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:04,879
your eyes will be open and you'll be like God. Is that it's a paraphrase but

431
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:11,919
is that not what he said? He's persuasive. He's persistent. He's persuasive. The

432
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:17,079
enemy is gonna try to make things look good, look appealing. That's what he does.

433
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,599
That's how he works. That's how he operates. So Paul is saying when you think about the

434
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,719
the false teaching that is prevalent and how they're active and you understand

435
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,399
some of the the attributes of these false teachers that you would understand

436
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:35,079
that there's some conflict. There's some some some anxiety. They've heard

437
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,440
this truth but now they're hearing these people come in and and maybe there's

438
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,679
some that are kind of siding with these false teachers and it's a causes

439
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:50,679
anxiety. It causes this great level of difficulty within the body of believers.

440
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:58,719
Why? He's seeking to divide. Paul says there in verse number two that their

441
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:04,199
hearts might be comforted. I'm thankful that our God is the God of all comfort.

442
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,919
We don't have time this morning but perhaps you'd like to write in your

443
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:12,359
notes to go back to the book of 2nd Corinthians and chapter number one and

444
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:18,320
read of all of the way in which Paul would describe the the fact that our God

445
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,399
is the God of all comfort. It's in 2nd Corinthians 1 verses 3 through 6 and

446
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:26,039
you'll see it there and I trust that would be a blessing to you but as we

447
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,559
move on and look at what Paul says number two there in verse number two he

448
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:40,239
says being knit together in love. I like the phrase knit together. It gives us the

449
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,000
understanding of unity. It helps us understand this knit together in love.

450
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,759
Remember what Jesus said in John chapter number 13 as he would give

451
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:54,839
instruction to the disciples. He says a new commandment I give you that you love

452
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:02,039
one another as as I have loved you. By this, by what?

453
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,679
What? Our love one for another.

454
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,039
Shall all men know that You are My disciples?

455
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,639
And Paul says that we'd be knit together in love.

456
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,739
That there would be some unity.

457
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,039
You'd understand this morning

458
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,359
that unity is the result of embracing truth.

459
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,859
Unity is the result of embracing truth.

460
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,319
It is not possible that we could have

461
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,659
some level of unity by just simply

462
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:33,199
setting aside something that would divide us.

463
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,819
It's embracing truth that brings unity.

464
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,019
And what is that truth? It's the Word of God.

465
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,579
And as we would embrace the truth of the Word of God,

466
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,299
and we'd understand this morning,

467
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:46,659
listen, there's a group of people,

468
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,579
and really it's a large group of people

469
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,499
that would try to pretend this morning

470
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:57,459
in our world that truth is relative.

471
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,779
That's ridiculous.

472
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:02,899
There's not your truth and my truth.

473
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:03,939
Amen?

474
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,819
There's truth.

475
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,539
And truth stands.

476
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,099
Truth endures.

477
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:11,339
Thy Word is truth.

478
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:16,399
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

479
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:19,219
There's some people that would like

480
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:22,299
to pretend that truth is relative.

481
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:23,699
Well, that's just their truth,

482
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,859
and you can have your truth, and you can embrace.

483
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,619
Did that work for you in school?

484
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,059
When you took an exam?

485
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,899
I mean, did you ever take an exam

486
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:35,579
and get a question wrong?

487
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,019
We did, right?

488
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:40,099
When you put the answer on the exam,

489
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:42,859
did you think it was right?

490
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:44,259
I mean, otherwise, you probably

491
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:46,579
wouldn't have put that answer.

492
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:48,139
Did you argue with the professor,

493
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,219
with the teacher, and say,

494
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:50,499
well, that might be your truth,

495
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:54,259
but this is my truth?

496
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:57,699
Ridiculous, is it not?

497
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:00,259
But we pretend that that can work somehow.

498
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:02,539
It can't.

499
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:05,939
There's truth, and it's the Word of God.

500
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:10,899
And as we embrace truth, we can have unity.

501
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:14,419
The enemy seeks to divide.

502
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:16,259
Notice what Paul says to the believers

503
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,139
over in Ephesus.

504
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:21,539
Turn back, if you will, to Ephesians chapter number four.

505
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,619
Ephesians chapter number four.

506
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:30,299
In verse number three, Paul says this,

507
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:35,619
Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit

508
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,859
in the bond of peace.

509
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:42,059
The idea of endeavoring is the idea

510
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,619
of laboring for something,

511
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,339
desiring it and being diligent to get it.

512
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,019
But the reality is that when he speaks

513
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:50,899
about this truth of endeavoring

514
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:53,139
to keep the unity of the Spirit

515
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,299
in the bond of peace,

516
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:58,699
it's as we hold dear to the truth of this book.

517
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:00,339
I've used the illustration before

518
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:01,979
of the tuning fork that would be used

519
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,139
to tune a piano.

520
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:06,139
And if you use the same tuning fork,

521
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,059
and you can travel large distances

522
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:10,179
from one piano to the next piano,

523
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:11,979
but if you use the same instrument,

524
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:13,539
that same tuning fork,

525
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:15,179
and you tune those pianos,

526
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:18,099
though they're distanced apart from one another,

527
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,339
they will have the same sound.

528
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,859
Why? Because you use the same tuning fork.

529
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,659
It's just the way it works.

530
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,099
What's our quote-unquote tuning fork?

531
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:30,419
The Word of God.

532
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:31,819
We can have unity with believers

533
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,619
in all sorts of different cultures

534
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,419
and countries around the world.

535
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,459
Why? Because we embrace the truth

536
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:41,299
of God's Word, and it leads to unity.

537
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:44,219
We find even there in the book of Philippians,

538
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:45,579
we see here in the book of Ephesians,

539
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:46,139
he speaks of it.

540
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:51,179
Look in Philippians 2.

541
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:58,139
In Philippians 2, in verse 1,

542
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:58,579
Paul says,

543
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,379
"...if there be therefore any consolation in Christ,

544
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:02,459
if any comfort of love,

545
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:03,659
if any fellowship of the Spirit,

546
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:04,899
if any bowels and mercies,

547
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:07,379
fulfill ye my joy,

548
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,939
that ye be like-minded,

549
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,059
having the same love,

550
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:13,499
being of one accord and of one mind."

551
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:14,779
How do we accomplish that?

552
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,099
We all come from different backgrounds.

553
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:20,459
Our mind is transformed

554
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:23,979
by the truth of God's Word.

555
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:25,659
Paul says in Romans 12

556
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:27,019
that we're not to be conformed to this world,

557
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:28,339
but that we're to be transformed

558
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:31,499
by the renewing of your mind.

559
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:33,739
That's how we can have unity.

560
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,779
Though we come from various backgrounds,

561
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:38,219
though we've had different influences in our life,

562
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:40,219
when we allow the Word of God

563
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,899
to do what only God's Word can do

564
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,019
in the lives of His people,

565
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,059
it brings unity.

566
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,179
It allows us to be like-minded.

567
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:50,539
Not that we're robots.

568
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,619
Not that we're just a bunch of people

569
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,939
following aimlessly and mindlessly.

570
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:58,139
No, no.

571
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:00,739
We've examined this book!

572
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,819
And we hold it dear and we hold it true.

573
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:06,539
And it brings unity.

574
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,059
Some people say,

575
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,339
oh, you guys are a bunch of puppets.

576
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:09,899
No, no, no.

577
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:12,579
We just have the same truth.

578
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,019
Amen?

579
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,859
Look at verse number three.

580
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,579
Let nothing be done

581
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:21,259
through strife or vainglory,

582
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:22,619
but in lowliness of mind

583
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,379
let each esteem other better than themselves.

584
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:25,859
Look not every man on his own things,

585
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,579
but every man also on the things of others.

586
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,259
Notice verse number five.

587
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,299
Let this mind be in you,

588
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:33,019
which was also in Christ Jesus.

589
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:34,379
We need to have the mind of Christ.

590
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:35,659
He goes on to explain.

591
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:38,099
We don't have time to look at all of that this morning,

592
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,259
but we find that we can have unity

593
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,979
as we embrace truth.

594
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,419
Here in the book of Colossians,

595
00:45:43,419 --> 00:45:45,899
we find that he speaks about unity

596
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:46,859
to these believers.

597
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:48,739
And he says in this passage

598
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,779
that we're studying this morning

599
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:50,939
in chapter two and verse number two,

600
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:54,779
being knit together in love.

601
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:59,299
I like the imagery of being knit together.

602
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,699
That bond of love

603
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:03,099
as we would embrace the truth.

604
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,419
Now you understand this morning

605
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,339
that as the people of God,

606
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:07,419
that there are some people

607
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:09,139
that are a little further along

608
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:13,379
in their journey with God than you may be.

609
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,699
Amen?

610
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:18,099
And as that would be the case,

611
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:19,779
it's through that humility

612
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:22,099
that Paul spoke of to the believers in Philippi

613
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:23,579
that would enable us to be able

614
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,019
to effectively minister to those individuals

615
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:29,259
and see them grow in grace and knowledge

616
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:32,059
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

617
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:36,259
Colossians 2, look at the rest of verse number two.

618
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:37,739
We see that Paul would mention

619
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:40,979
the truth of spiritual growth and maturity.

620
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:42,259
It says this,

621
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:44,259
"...and unto all riches

622
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,979
of the full assurance of understanding

623
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:49,339
to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God

624
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,179
unto the Father and of Christ,

625
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:53,619
in whom are hid all the treasures

626
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:56,579
of wisdom and knowledge."

627
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,619
As we look at the last phrase of verse number two

628
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,859
in the entirety of verse number three,

629
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:04,099
we find again that this spiritual growth

630
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,299
and maturity is in full view.

631
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:08,379
We find that he uses the terminology

632
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:09,579
in verse number two,

633
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:11,019
notice what he says,

634
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:14,899
"...the full assurance of understanding."

635
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,899
I'm thankful that we have the whole Bible.

636
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:19,499
The whole canon of Scripture.

637
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:22,899
Listen, if there's something that you don't know

638
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:24,859
that God hasn't told us,

639
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:26,659
there's no person that's going to give you

640
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:29,499
some extra revelation.

641
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:31,819
That's what the false teachers want to say.

642
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:32,619
Right?

643
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,579
But God said, the book is finished.

644
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,179
His Word is settled in heaven.

645
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:39,979
We're not looking for any new revelation,

646
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:41,339
any more revelation.

647
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:44,019
We have the Word of God.

648
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:47,659
And he says that you can have a full assurance

649
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,299
of understanding.

650
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,739
Isn't that awesome?

651
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:52,579
Somebody comes and says,

652
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:57,259
let me give you some enlightenment.

653
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:58,219
No, no.

654
00:47:58,219 --> 00:47:59,499
I have the Word of God.

655
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:00,899
At the entrance of Thy words,

656
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:02,179
give it light.

657
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,059
Amen?

658
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:06,699
Remind that he says,

659
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:09,019
"...to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God."

660
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,059
Again, he would use these terminologies

661
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,819
that these false teachers would use.

662
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:14,619
And he speaks again about this acknowledgment

663
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:15,619
of the mystery of God.

664
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:16,859
What is the mystery of God?

665
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,259
We would find that he mentioned

666
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,859
in chapter 1 that it's Christ in you,

667
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,019
the hope of glory,

668
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:23,859
and we studied the passage of Scripture

669
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,019
even in verse 19 of chapter 1,

670
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:27,459
how that we would understand

671
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:29,499
that Christ is the mystery of God

672
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,419
in the sense that it is the Lord Jesus Christ

673
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:38,619
that manifests God to man.

674
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:42,339
Bottom line, Christ is all I need.

675
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:43,339
The songwriter said,

676
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:44,380
Christ is all I need.

677
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,459
All, all I need.

678
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,259
We find in verse 19,

679
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:52,739
it says this of chapter 1 in verse 19,

680
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,019
"...for it pleased the Father

681
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,139
that in Him..."

682
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,899
Who is Him? It's Christ.

683
00:48:57,899 --> 00:48:59,940
If you go back and look at the context,

684
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,820
you'll understand he's speaking of Christ.

685
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:07,619
"...that in Him should all fullness dwell."

686
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,579
Hebrews 1 speaks of the same thing.

687
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,099
We don't have time to go there.

688
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,779
But we find that Paul is saying

689
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,539
to these believers in Colossae,

690
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,699
he's saying, listen,

691
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:18,619
the way to resolve the conflict that I have

692
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,899
is that we would have this comfort,

693
00:49:20,899 --> 00:49:22,739
that we would have this encouragement

694
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:24,940
and this strength by consolation

695
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,259
that our hearts would be knit together in love,

696
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:28,500
that we would have unity,

697
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,579
and that we would have spiritual growth

698
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,019
and maturity.

699
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:32,859
Why?

700
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:36,099
Because then the false teachers have no chance.

701
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:39,659
Honestly, if you have a group of people,

702
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:41,179
if Fellowship Baptist Church,

703
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,459
we'll use ourselves as an example this morning,

704
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:47,219
if we have, if our hearts are comforted,

705
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:49,659
if we're encouraging and strengthening one another

706
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,820
through this consolation,

707
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,699
if we have this unity

708
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,500
because we've embraced the truth of the Word of God,

709
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,139
if we're growing and we have spiritual growth

710
00:49:58,179 --> 00:49:59,339
and maturity,

711
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,979
and some false teacher walks in these doors.

712
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,639
He's not going to have a chance.

713
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:05,759
Amen?

714
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:07,919
You understand, I'm coming off the platform, Jim.

715
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:10,839
You understand this morning that false teachers,

716
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,599
they're not going to come talk to me

717
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,479
about their false teaching.

718
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,319
They're going to come to Samantha.

719
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,479
They're going to come to some other young person

720
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:21,559
in our church.

721
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,799
They're going to come to you.

722
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:24,679
They're going to try to have dinner with you.

723
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,219
And they're going to try to introduce

724
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:27,719
their false teaching.

725
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:29,759
That's how they work.

726
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,339
It's what they do.

727
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,239
It's okay that the pastor has grown spiritually

728
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,459
and has an understanding of the Word of God,

729
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:45,159
but the people have to be spiritually mature.

730
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:48,299
You have to be growing in your walk with God.

731
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:49,899
So that when a false teacher comes in

732
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:51,499
and meets with you and you say,

733
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:53,419
we don't believe that.

734
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:55,019
And here's why we don't believe that,

735
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,259
because the Word of God says,

736
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:58,719
and all of a sudden, they put their tail

737
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,239
between their knees and they go running out.

738
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,079
Why?

739
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,059
Because they don't want to mess with you.

740
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:05,639
You know the Bible.

741
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:08,299
Amen.

742
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,679
It's the way it works.

743
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,039
And so Paul's saying, I believe.

744
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,779
If we're going to resolve this great conflict,

745
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:18,979
man, we need to have some believers

746
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:22,019
that are strong spiritually.

747
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:24,019
That have unity.

748
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:26,819
That are comforting and strengthening one another,

749
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:29,639
encouraging one another with comfort.

750
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:31,819
And as we have that,

751
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,439
those false teachers are going to go down the road

752
00:51:33,439 --> 00:51:35,199
and find someone else to mess with.

753
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,999
But if we don't have that,

754
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,639
those false teachers come in

755
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:45,499
and they begin to introduce their false teaching.

756
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:47,959
And they influence this family.

757
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,439
And they find this family over here to influence.

758
00:51:52,439 --> 00:51:54,719
And then they influence another family.

759
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,019
They say, don't talk to pastor about this.

760
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:00,899
Right?

761
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:03,339
They get this family and that family,

762
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:04,859
and then all of a sudden,

763
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,919
they have this nucleus of people in a church

764
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,539
that's all on board with what their agenda is.

765
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:13,939
Do you know that you can walk,

766
00:52:13,939 --> 00:52:15,779
or not walk, that you could walk,

767
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:18,139
but you can travel around the United States of America

768
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:20,799
and you can find churches all over our land

769
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:23,199
that one day stood on truth.

770
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:28,739
That today look nothing like what they once stood for.

771
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:29,699
Why?

772
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:32,319
Because some guy came in and took it captive.

773
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,579
It happens.

774
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:37,699
Do your research.

775
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,019
Happens all the time.

776
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:44,499
Why is it that we watch for your souls as spiritual leaders?

777
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:47,859
Why is it that we're instructed to feed the flock of God

778
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,819
so that we can be spiritually mature?

779
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,119
So that we can be strengthened

780
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,239
against the attack of the enemy?

781
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,559
So that we can stand for truth?

782
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:01,639
We find this morning that Paul says,

783
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,359
I have this great conflict.

784
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,259
I have this great conflict.

785
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,239
And I believe this morning that

786
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,039
if the people of God would get serious

787
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:14,359
about knowing God and his word,

788
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,919
we could see some resolution, if you will,

789
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:20,039
to this great conflict.

790
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:20,879
Why?

791
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:23,419
Because the spiritual leader can kind of take,

792
00:53:23,419 --> 00:53:27,059
if you will, not that he's going to be negligent

793
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:29,299
in any of his duties or responsibilities,

794
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,099
but he can have an assurance that

795
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,459
the people that God's called me to lead,

796
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:41,419
they're solid, they know the word of God,

797
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,179
and they're gonna be able to stand.

798
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:49,139
See, this morning, we've mentioned the reason

799
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,839
for this conflict.

800
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:56,279
And we've acknowledged that the enemy's still working today.

801
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:58,039
The enemy is active, he's working.

802
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:01,199
And the question that I'd ask myself

803
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,679
and I'd ask you this morning,

804
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,179
are you growing?

805
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,259
Are you grounded?

806
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:10,599
Can you give a defense of your faith?

807
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,119
Are you able to go to the word of God

808
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:17,519
and understand, thus saith the Lord?

809
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,199
That's what God's word says.

810
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:21,859
See, that we would be growing.

811
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:23,579
Why is Paul saying, I'm warning every man

812
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:25,539
and teaching every man?

813
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:28,419
Because he understands the false teachers are active.

814
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:30,579
And as we teach the word of God,

815
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:34,979
oh, God will help us to be strengthened.

816
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:37,739
And we can know what God's word says.

817
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:39,579
When that enemy comes, that false teacher,

818
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,059
that email that somebody sends you,

819
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:44,139
hey, look what I found online, it's great, isn't it?

820
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,339
So actually, it's not true, and here's why.

821
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,899
I know that's not popular.

822
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:51,579
I understand that.

823
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,579
But we better be grounded and settled

824
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:56,819
on the truth of God's word.

825
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,899
Paul's great conflict.

826
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,419
This morning, I believe that there are many

827
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:02,339
spiritual leaders all across this land

828
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:05,619
that are in the same situation that Paul was in.

829
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:09,299
There's a concern that we have for the people of God.

830
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:13,179
Why do we teach the word of God?

831
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:16,139
Desire to give truth, service after service,

832
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,799
week after week, because we know

833
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,959
that there are false teachers that abound.

834
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:25,839
It's God's plan that we would be grounded,

835
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,839
that we would not be tossed to and fro

836
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,759
with any wind of doctrine, as Paul says

837
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,719
to the leaders in Ephesus.

838
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:34,119
No, no, here's what God's word says.

839
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:36,239
This morning, how are you growing?

840
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:38,919
Are you growing?

841
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,199
I'm not asking you to tell me,

842
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:42,759
but I'm asking you to evaluate your own life.

843
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:44,359
Are you growing?

844
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:46,379
How are you growing?

845
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,939
Do you wanna grow?

846
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:49,739
Is there that desire?

847
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:55,579
Oh, if there is, outside of the services

848
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,179
that we have weekly, getting active and involved

849
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:00,019
in those services and hearing the teaching

850
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:01,139
and preaching of the word of God.

851
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:02,899
You know, I don't preach the same message tonight

852
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:04,659
that I preached this morning.

853
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:06,939
I preached an entirely different message.

854
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,379
I don't preach the same message on Wednesday

855
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:09,219
that I preached on Sunday.

856
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:10,939
It's an entirely different message.

857
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:14,839
So that we can get the truth of God's word

858
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,859
into the hearts of God's people.

859
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:20,119
So that we can be strengthened and prepared

860
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,239
for the attack of the enemy.

861
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:23,079
Amen, let's pray.

862
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:23,959
Father, we love you.

863
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:26,339
We thank you for loving us.

864
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:28,799
Thank you for truth.

865
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:34,899
I pray, God, this morning that you would help us to stand.

866
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:40,899
Help us to be spiritually growing, mature believers.

867
00:56:47,959 --> 00:56:49,759
That the false teacher that would seek

868
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:52,559
to infiltrate this congregation

869
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:58,679
would meet a group of people that are settled

870
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,799
and grounded on the truth.

871
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,159
That know the word of God.

872
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:10,239
We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ.

873
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:13,219
We thank you for the word of God.

874
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:17,079
I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

875
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,879
maybe they've been influenced by some false teaching

876
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:29,199
that would deny the person of Jesus Christ as being God.

877
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,899
Perhaps they would deny the teaching

878
00:57:31,899 --> 00:57:36,079
that thy word is sufficient and it's all we need.

879
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,159
We're not looking for any new revelation,

880
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:39,679
any more revelation.

881
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,279
Perhaps they've been influenced

882
00:57:43,279 --> 00:57:45,699
by some other form of false teaching.

883
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:49,499
They've never trusted Christ.

884
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,719
I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

885
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,179
They'd understand that Jesus Christ is God.

886
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,919
He came to this world at the appointed time

887
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,419
when the fullness of time was come.

888
00:58:02,419 --> 00:58:03,939
God sent forth His Son.

889
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,659
He was born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life,

890
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,499
bled and died to be our substitute,

891
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:16,959
buried and rose in victory,

892
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,859
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

893
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:21,659
He's the Savior of the world.

894
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,459
I pray that this morning,

895
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:27,859
that individual that may not know you

896
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:30,859
would trust Christ today.

897
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,119
For each believer, Lord, help us to grow.

898
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,239
Help us to not get comfortable.

899
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:40,000
Help us to not get stagnant,

900
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:44,019
self-sufficient, self-dependent.

901
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:45,880
Help us, God, to be eager,

902
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:51,039
to hunger and thirst for the word of God,

903
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,719
to know you, as Paul said.

904
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,599
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

905
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,320
That's why we do these efforts in Christ's name we pray.

906
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,380
Would you stand with me?

907
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,239
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

908
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,739
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

909
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:08,820
Perhaps you need to come and ask the Lord to help you.

910
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,260
Perhaps there's some that would come

911
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,019
and pray for our church as a whole.

912
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:16,380
God would protect us and strengthen us.

913
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,899
Need some men to come and pray for our congregation.

914
00:59:19,899 --> 00:59:21,859
The enemy's active.

915
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,779
As Kimberly plays, would you allow the Holy Spirit of God

916
00:59:24,779 --> 00:59:26,239
to have His way in your life?
