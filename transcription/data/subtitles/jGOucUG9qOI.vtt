00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
1 Samuel this morning, and my heart was blessed.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.400
I trust that you had sweet time with the Lord this morning as well, and what a blessing

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.119
it is to enter into His presence.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:15.359
What a joy that we have the Word of God, and God uses His Word in our hearts and our lives,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.360
amen?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.340
And there are many things that are seeking to influence the heart and mind of the people

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.399
of God, and God's given us this precious book, and oh, how wonderful it is.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.620
The Bible says of itself that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it tells

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.779
us that it's profitable, and you know, it's profitable when we're reading it, when we're

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:36.740
obeying it, amen?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.419
And we're to be doers of the Word and not hearers only, and I'm so thankful for this

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:41.819
precious book.

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:46.520
Last week, you'll remember that we finished up Colossians chapter number 1, and as we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.299
read through the last portion of this passage of Scripture and studied those verses of Scripture,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.139
we understood that Paul was giving a description of the ministry in which God had called him

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:58.540
to.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.300
The Apostle Paul had suffered adversity, in fact, he speaks specifically about the sufferings

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.900
that he was currently enduring.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.739
We understand that at the time of the writing, the Apostle Paul is in prison, and yet he

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:16.500
remained faithful to the call of God upon his life, and he had a desire to finish his

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
race.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.540
And we understand that Paul says to the believers, really the elders in Ephesus, as he calls

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.300
them to meet him on his way to Jerusalem.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.940
It's recorded for us in Acts chapter number 20 that he had this desire, that he would

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.099
finish his course with joy.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.699
And Paul understood that he had been given a stewardship, a responsibility.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:49.620
It's referred to in verse 25 as the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.620
And what a blessing to see how the Apostle Paul desired to finish his race, to do that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.980
which God had called him to do.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.819
No doubt in my mind it is the believers in Colossae read this first chapter, and we understand

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.300
the chapter divisions were added far later than when they actually received the letter.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.419
But in our study of the book of Colossians, when they've come to this point, which we

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:20.139
are, there's no doubt in my mind that they have been able to easily tell the difference

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.300
between the philosophy of the Apostle Paul and that of the false teachers.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.740
You'll remember that Paul never physically ministered in Colossae.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.139
He did not know these people personally.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.179
They did not know him personally, yet he desired to share with them truth, and he understood

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:44.740
that the enemy using false teachers was active in the city of Colossae.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.539
And so Paul is sharing some philosophy with them.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.220
You'll recall with me that he mentions in verse number 28 of chapter number one the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.539
three aspects of ministry.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:59.979
If he were to give an overview of the ministry that God called him to, he says, number one,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.520
we preach Christ.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.660
He says it this way, whom we preach, but we understand contextually, as you finish verse

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.419
number 27, he says, Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.500
First aspect of the ministry of the Apostle Paul was preaching Christ.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.100
By the way, isn't that a wonderful opportunity that we have to preach Christ?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.759
To let people know about the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he's done for us and that which

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.300
he would do for them.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.860
We find that he then continues and says this, warning every man.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.860
Warning every man.

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.139
And what's interesting is when we enter into the second chapter, you don't get far before

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.580
you find in verse number eight that he uses the word, beware.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.699
Remember, he shared with them in chapter number one this philosophy of ministry and explaining

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.580
to them the approach to ministry.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.059
He's preaching Christ, he's warning every man, and then he says this, number three,

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:54.660
teaching every man.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.059
What a joy it is to teach the word of God.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.139
The Bible says that the entrance of thy words, it giveth light.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.139
And I'm so thankful for the power of the word of God.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.100
And we understand that we have an enemy that seeks to blind the hearts and minds of the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.380
people of the world.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.339
And we find that the word of God is that which giveth light.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:20.260
And I'm so thankful that we have the privilege of being able to teach the word of God.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.420
And he says this as he shares the philosophy of ministry and describes the ministry in

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.980
these three ways.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.779
He gives to these believers in Colossae the goal or purpose of ministry.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:39.140
And we find that at the end of verse number 28, that we may present every man perfect

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.019
in Christ Jesus.

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.179
What a great goal.

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:46.820
What a great desire that Paul has for these believers in Colossae.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.140
And we find that as he would share these things and give this truth to these believers, there's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.940
no doubt in my mind that as they read about the love and concern that Paul has for them,

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:04.420
as they read about the way in which Paul was praying for them, people that he had never met,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.859
yet he's praying for them always, he says.

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:13.100
And he exalts Christ and he explains the ministry.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.700
As we enter into chapter number 2, we find that Paul continues to express his love and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.100
concern for these believers in Colossae.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.179
You understand that Paul was not seeking to get anything from these believers.

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:31.320
He was not seeking to increase some kingdom for himself.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.899
He was not seeking some accolades, recognition, any type of monetary gains.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:38.619
He was not seeking that.

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:42.260
He was simply desiring to be a blessing to these believers.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.100
It reminds me of what Paul would say to the believers in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 12, 14 and 15.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.339
It's not the entirety of either one of those verses, but you find that Paul says this to

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:58.660
the believers in Corinth, I seek not yours, but you.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:08.019
And then he says this, I will very gladly spend and be spent for you.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:13.739
Is that not a great contrast to the philosophy and approach of false teachers?

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:19.459
We find that here as we enter into Colossians chapter number 2, that Paul says this, notice

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:28.179
with me in verse number 1, for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:34.459
and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, that

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:40.899
their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.260
full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:53.940
of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.179
We'll stop there this morning.

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.140
We'll just look at the first three verses of Colossians 2.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.940
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message, Paul's Great Conflict.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.140
Paul's Great Conflict.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.380
Notice with me, if you're taking notes, number 1, Paul reveals the conflict that he has for

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.779
these believers.

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:15.700
We find that as you begin reading in verse number 1, that Paul has a desire that these

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.500
believers in Colossae would have a knowledge and an understanding of that which he was

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.540
calling a great conflict.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.299
Really we would understand this morning that Paul was so deeply concerned for these believers

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:38.660
that the way in which he described that deep concern was that he had a great conflict.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.059
Now we're familiar with conflicts.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:46.260
In fact, we live in a time and an era in which very few people understand anything about

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.339
conflict resolution.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:53.779
We find that we live, and we have experienced, if you have lived for any length of time,

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.579
you've experienced conflict.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:08:02.260
We find that Paul is describing for these believers in Colossae this conflict that he

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.899
has, really it's an internal conflict that he's dealing with, and yes, there are some

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:13.660
external things that would lend to and lead to the conflict that Paul was experiencing,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.059
but he says to these believers in Colossae, that I want you to know, for I would that

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:22.859
ye knew what great conflict I have for you.

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:28.500
I believe that as we begin to read this portion of Scripture and have the opportunity to kind

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.500
of see the heart of the Apostle Paul a little bit here, we see other glimpses into the heart

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.099
of the Apostle Paul when he says in Romans 9 and Romans 10 that his heart's desire for

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:47.140
his kinsmen, his brethren, according to the flesh, is that they might be saved.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:54.820
And Paul is sharing here, he's allowing the believers in Colossae to see the heart of

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.820
a spiritual leader.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.059
The heart of one that has this great concern, this great, as he describes it, conflict for

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:04.539
these believers.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:10.739
We find that this concern that Paul had, this conflict that he would reveal to these believers

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:15.460
in Colossae, you'll understand as you read the entirety of verse number one, that it

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.020
was not simply for the brethren in Colossae.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:26.059
He says this, for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:34.299
at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh.

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:40.260
I want you to consider that these two cities that are mentioned specifically, Colossae

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
and Laodicea, we understand that Colossae is not mentioned here in verse number one,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.419
but he says for you, and we understand the book is written to the believers in Colossae,

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:52.280
and so we'd understand that he mentions these two cities, Colossae and Laodicea.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.760
They're separated by about 11 miles, but it would seem as we'll continue our study

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.039
this morning that those false teachers that were there in...

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:05.459
Colossae have also had some level of influence there in Laodicea. He says not

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:10.219
only is he concerned about these particular churches that are established

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:14.899
in these regions, in these locations, but he says, and for as many as have not seen

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:20.699
my face in the flesh. You understand that as you trace the steps of the

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:23.939
Apostle Paul throughout the book of Acts, and then as you study the epistles that

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:27.899
God would allow him to pen, you'll find that the Apostle Paul had much

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:34.219
opportunity, had several areas in which he traveled and saw churches

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:38.419
established. The first missionary journey that he took as he went into the

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:42.259
regions of Galatia, there were no less than four churches that were started as

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:48.219
a result of that one single missionary journey. But you understand that from

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:52.579
these churches there were other churches that were established. When Paul would

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:56.779
write to the church in Thessalonica, a church in which he was able to enter

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.919
into that city and see a church established in short order, you would

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:05.819
find that Paul, as he writes back to that church, he commends them in 1st

00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:13.619
Thessalonians 1, that from them went forth, sounded forth, the gospel. So the

00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:19.339
gospel's spreading. And so Paul was keenly aware of the fact that the

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:26.259
truth of God's Word and the expansion of biblical Christianity was not just the

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:31.459
people that he had personally ministered among. There were others that

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:37.579
had not yet seen his face, and Paul has a concern for those believers as well. And

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:46.299
Paul is sharing this truth, and he says, I would that ye knew what great conflict

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:51.939
I have for you and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:56.019
in the flesh. Turn over if you will, hold your place here, but look over at 2nd

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:59.699
Corinthians chapter number 11. I want you to see how Paul words it here to the

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:06.339
church in Corinth, really a similar truth that is being revealed here to us. We

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.259
find that the Apostle Paul is writing to these that he ministered among. You

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:15.539
understand that he served in Corinth for a lengthy period of time, perhaps one of

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:21.179
the longest durations of his ministry, and God blessed and worked, but of course

00:12:21.179 --> 00:12:24.819
we know that there was much division and contention within the church in Corinth,

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:29.099
and he writes these letters, and we find that Paul in chapter number 11 of 2nd

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:35.539
Corinthians is describing several things that he had endured. We find that Paul

00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:41.779
goes through, beginning in verse number 23, he says, Are they ministers of Christ? I

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:46.979
speak as a fool, I am more. In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in

00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:52.379
prisons more frequent, in deaths oft of the Jews. Five times received I forty

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:56.939
stripes, save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I

00:12:56.939 --> 00:13:02.779
suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I have been in the deep. In journeyings

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:08.979
often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen,

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:12.979
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in

00:13:12.979 --> 00:13:17.059
perils in the sea, in perils among the brethren, in weariness and painfulness,

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:22.979
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:28.859
Now when you read that list, you say, most of us have not experienced anything like

00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:33.659
that. Amen? But you know what Paul says about those things, and I'm not even to

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:37.179
the really the climax of what I want to get to there in 2nd Corinthians 11, but

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:42.299
if you think back to chapter number 4 of the same book, Paul says this. Now he

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:46.499
describes in detail all of these things that I just read to you in chapter

00:13:46.499 --> 00:13:51.779
number 11. In chapter number 4, he just calls them the things. Notice here, he

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:55.779
says, for which cause we faint not, in chapter 4 and verse number 16, but

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:00.299
through, excuse me, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:06.979
day by day, for our light affliction. Did you hear all of those things that he

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:13.419
mentioned in chapter number 11? Would you describe that as light affliction?

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:24.499
Paul says our light affliction is but for a moment, but for a moment, worketh

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:36.019
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:41.219
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which

00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:47.019
are seen are temporal. The things which are not seen are eternal. Paul had a good

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:52.379
perspective on life, did he not? He says our light affliction, which is but for a

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:58.899
moment. Paul was looking to eternity, and he suffered all these things, but I want

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.539
you to notice what he says back in chapter 11 in verse number 28. He says

00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:15.299
this, beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, notice what

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:25.419
he says, the care of all the churches. The care of all the churches. This morning as

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:31.519
I see the heart of the Apostle Paul in Colossians chapter number 2, in saying to these believers

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:38.679
in Colossae that I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them

00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:45.439
at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. He summarizes it in

00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:53.359
2 Corinthians 11.28 and says that it's the care of all the churches. This morning as

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:58.719
I read, as I've studied throughout the period of time as I've prepared this message and

00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:03.479
I've read the book of Colossians dozens of times last year and the last quarter just

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:08.759
in preparation for this study, I don't know how many times I've read the book of Colossians,

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:15.479
but I know that as I come to this first verse of chapter number 2, I once again am seeing

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:22.559
and realizing the passion that Paul had and the sincerity, the transparency that he's

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:33.419
sharing with those in which he seeks to minister. As a spiritual leader, the care of one church,

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:40.919
one body of believers, it's significant. It's serious. And we find that Paul is saying,

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:49.039
I want you to know what great conflict I have. This conflict that he has, as I mentioned

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:57.359
already, he's so deeply concerned for them that he calls it a great conflict. As a pastor,

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:01.719
as you study the book of Hebrews as we did last year, you find in chapter number 13 that

00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:08.639
the Bible describes one aspect of the responsibility of the pastor as one that watches for your

00:17:08.639 --> 00:17:19.959
soul. Wow. It's a serious responsibility. And this morning, a true spiritual leader

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:28.019
will take seriously the responsibility of the call that God has placed upon their lives.

00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:33.279
We find this morning that Paul says, I want to reveal something to you. I want to reveal

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:38.239
this great conflict that I have. As we continue and move through the passage of Scripture

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:44.159
here in Colossians 2, we consider, number two, the reason for this conflict. What was

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:51.559
the reason that Paul had to lead to this great conflict that he refers to in verse number

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:56.399
1? He says that it's for those that are in Colossae, for those that are in Laodicea,

00:17:56.399 --> 00:18:01.639
for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. Why is it? What is the reason? What

00:18:01.639 --> 00:18:07.159
has led Paul to this great conflict? Well, I believe that as you study the entirety of

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:11.359
the book of Colossians, as you study the whole of Scripture, that you would say very

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:17.559
simply this, it was the fact that the enemy was active. It was the fact that false teaching

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:22.859
was prevalent. It was the fact that Paul had gone and preached the Gospel and those that

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:28.479
had been saved take the Gospel far and wide and they seek to reach the world with the

00:18:28.479 --> 00:18:34.719
Gospel of Jesus Christ and many have been saved. And the Bible says of those in the

00:18:34.719 --> 00:18:39.000
book of Acts and Paul and all of the missionary journeys that they that have turned the world

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
upside down have come here. I mean, the Word of God was marching forward and God was blessing

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.719
and working, but we find that the enemy is always active. The enemy is always active.

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:56.799
And it was the activity of the enemy, it was the false teaching that was prevalent, not

00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:02.599
only in Colossae, but had affected those in Laodicea, no doubt had affected many other

00:19:02.639 --> 00:19:08.000
congregations throughout the known world at that point. And Paul says it's because of

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.959
this activity, it's because of this false teaching that my heart, that I'm burdened,

00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:20.959
that I'm concerned that I have this great conflict. We find that it was there in Colossae

00:19:21.199 --> 00:19:28.199
the enemy would use deception and false teaching and we find that the enemy would seek to these

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:34.320
Gnostics that were active there in Colossae. One of their approaches would be that of this

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.159
high intellect. And they would speak often about wisdom and knowledge and they would

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:46.559
speak about mysteries and the way in which you could attain some spiritual level of some

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:52.880
mystery and some knowledge that was held back from others. Thus, you find so often that

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.320
Paul would use those same terminologies here in the book of Colossians as he's ministering

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.079
to these believers in Colossae.

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:06.079
Colossi to help them understand that it is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:10.399
Remember back in chapter 1 in verse number 27, to whom God would make known

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:15.079
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:22.339
Christ in you, the hope of glory. He'll say in verse number 3 of this chapter 2,

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:30.539
in whom, speaking of Christ, are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:36.339
These false teachers that were active in Colossi, they often would use this thing

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:40.259
of intellect and they would speak of some wisdom or knowledge. I am thankful

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:44.939
that Paul is writing Scripture, that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:50.819
I'm thankful today that we have the whole of God's Word and we have the

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:57.539
wisdom of God, the mind of Christ. And what a joy it is for us to know the

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:02.259
truth of the Word of God and that we can take the truth of God's Word and we can,

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:09.099
as John said in 1 John, try the spirits because we have the Word of God.

00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:14.299
You hear some teaching, you hear someone come in with some, man they sound good,

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:19.679
they're eloquent, and they use these big words and this great vocabulary. Be

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:27.439
careful not to be awed by that. Check them to the Scriptures. Amen? I don't care

00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:31.479
how many letters somebody has after their name, before their name, it matters

00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:38.399
not if they do not agree with what thus saith the Lord. Amen? If we're not careful,

00:21:38.399 --> 00:21:43.159
you get on some internet site, you get some YouTube something or whatever, you

00:21:43.159 --> 00:21:47.559
say, oh but this person has a doctorate in this and they have a this and a that.

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:55.839
Be careful. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. Romans chapter

00:21:55.839 --> 00:22:05.039
number one. Teaching must match this book. What was the tactic of the enemy in

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.679
Laodicea? You know, it actually was different than what it was in Colossae.

00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:13.679
Turn over to Revelation, if you will, chapter number three. We'll be back there

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:17.839
to the book of Colossians in just a moment, but I want you to see that God

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:22.879
has given us, the Bible's awesome, I love the Word of God, there's not much that we

00:22:22.879 --> 00:22:28.879
know about this church in Laodicea. However, we find that God, as He would

00:22:28.879 --> 00:22:33.119
give John the responsibility of these letters that are recorded in the book of

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:37.759
Revelation to these seven churches in Asia, that the last of these letters is

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:42.639
written to the church that Paul would reference here in Colossians chapter

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:47.479
number two. He says, listen, I'm not only concerned for those, for you, those in

00:22:47.479 --> 00:22:51.639
Colossae, but those that are in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face. And

00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:55.279
as you come to Revelation chapter number three, beginning in verse number 14, you

00:22:55.279 --> 00:22:59.959
find that this letter to this church is written. I have referred to this church

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:06.439
in the past as being the rich, poor church. There's a previous church that I

00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:11.119
referred to, that in Philadelphia, as the weak, strong church. And we find that it

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:16.079
was the church in Smyrna that is the poor church, but they were rich in Christ.

00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:21.079
We find that it was just church in Laodicea that the Bible calls this

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:27.159
church in verse number 14, and unto the angel, notice what it says, of the church

00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:33.639
of the Laodiceans. It's very interesting because each of the previous six

00:23:33.639 --> 00:23:38.039
letters that are written to these churches are all addressed to the church

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:44.719
in whatever the city is. But here, the Bible says that it's the church of the

00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:51.479
Laodiceans. It says, write these things, saith the Amen, the faithful and true

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:56.599
witness, the beginning of the creation of God. Verse 15, I know thy works. Thou art

00:23:56.599 --> 00:24:01.119
neither cold nor hot. I would thou work cold or hot. So then, because thou art

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:06.679
lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Notice verse

00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:15.319
17, because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:24.639
nothing. I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing. In Laodicea,

00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:31.579
they were dealing with this level of self-sufficiency, plenty, wealth. When it

00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:34.919
says here that they have need of nothing, really, as you study the entirety of

00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:37.639
this passage, you would find that they almost came to the point they didn't

00:24:37.639 --> 00:24:45.599
think they needed God either. They were self-sufficient. They had plenty. The

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:50.919
continuation of verse number 17, it says this, and knowest not. You know, we can

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:56.439
have our perspective, but God has His perspective. Typically, we'd like to

00:24:56.439 --> 00:25:02.159
describe ourselves in better terms than God would describe us. Is it not true? And

00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:08.879
God says in verse number 17, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable

00:25:08.879 --> 00:25:17.519
and poor and blind and naked. Wow, that's a different description than what they

00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:24.159
had of themselves, is it not? Because thou sayest, here's what you say, here's what

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:30.679
God says. You find that the Bible says in verse number 19, as many as I love, I

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:36.759
rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Notice verse 20. Behold, I

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:41.359
stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:47.079
come into him and will sup with him and he with me. I know that often Revelation

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:51.039
3 and verse number 20, people will use that verse of Scripture as they try to

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:56.559
share the gospel with individuals, but the true context of this verse of

00:25:56.559 --> 00:26:01.839
Scripture is written to the church of the Laodiceans. Jesus said, I will build

00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:06.999
my church, and yet this church of the Laodiceans, the picture that we see in

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:13.519
verse number 20 is that Christ is on the outside of his church, knocking to get in.

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:22.159
Wow. See, the enemy was active in Colossae through the Gnostics and through their

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:26.839
level of intellect and wisdom and all of these things that they would speak of,

00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:33.319
and really causing the people to really struggle and sway back and forth,

00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:37.999
and in Laodicea, the enemy was working in a different manner. He was

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:41.199
saying, hey, you guys, you're good, man, you have all of this wealth, you don't

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:52.319
need this stuff. There's a danger in becoming self-sufficient, independent.

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:58.119
The Word of God tells us that Jesus said, I am the vine, you're the branches.

00:26:58.119 --> 00:27:09.479
Without me, ye can do nothing. We need him, and here we find, as we look back to the

00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:13.839
book of Colossians and consider the reason for this conflict that Paul is

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:18.599
describing in verse number one, we will remember that the enemy is subtle and

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:23.919
crafty. We'd understand that Paul would warn the believers in Ephesus and

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:28.279
instruct them to put on the whole armor of God, to go in the power and the

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:32.599
strength of God. Why? That they may be able to stand against the wiles of the

00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:40.079
devil, his trickery, his craftiness, his deceit. We find that the approach of the

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:46.279
enemy will vary, but I'm thankful that we're not ignorant of his devices. You

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:50.519
read the Word of God, and you read the entirety of God's Word, and you will find

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:56.439
many examples of how the enemy works. You will find in ways in which the

00:27:56.439 --> 00:28:02.999
enemy works in very deceitful means. He comes and speaks as if he's going to be

00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:07.639
one of you. In fact, Jude warns of that very thing, that the reason that he's

00:28:07.639 --> 00:28:13.599
writing that short but powerful epistle is that there were certain men that

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:21.639
crept in unawares, that had turned the grace of God into lasciviousness. And

00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:26.279
Jude is writing that short epistle to the people of God to warn them about

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:31.199
these false teachers that had crept into the church. We want to see the

00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:35.319
church grow, and it's a blessing to see the church grow, but oh, how we need to be

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:41.519
careful that we are mindful of the fact that the enemy does work, and he works in

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:47.879
such a way as that he'd like to infiltrate the church of God. We find

00:28:47.879 --> 00:28:57.679
that the enemy is tricky, he's crafty, he's subtle. This morning as we think

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:01.519
about these two illustrations or examples that God gives us from His Word

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:07.399
with regard to these two churches in particular, we find that today the enemy

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:14.119
is still working. The enemy is working. In fact, the book of Revelation teaches us

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:18.239
that he knows that this time is short. I believe that we're living in the last

00:29:18.239 --> 00:29:24.559
days, and I believe that it's almost kind of like that full-court press, if you

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:28.799
could use a basketball analogy. Satan's trying to pull out all the stops, if you

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:35.759
will, and he's working, he's active. We find that he's working today, he's seeking, I

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:40.919
believe, to separate and divide the people of God. You see the division in

00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:45.919
the church in Corinth, and you see how that he was using various tactics there,

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:51.199
and he was seeking to divide those individuals. We find that the enemy, he'll

00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:55.519
use all sorts of means, I mentioned a moment ago, about being careful of those

00:29:55.519 --> 00:30:00.039
false teachers that abound. It's amazing.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:06.399
how much information is at the fingertips of our people today. It really

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:11.799
is, it's amazing. Can I tell you that most of that which you would find on the

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:18.439
internet, I'd be careful of. I would be very careful. I warn you, that's what Paul

00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:25.079
said, I'm warning every man. There's a lot of false teaching out there, a lot of it.

00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:30.839
It's prevalent. And again, you understand that people will use this kind of thing,

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:38.119
well look at how many followers they have. I mean they must be right. People

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:45.439
think that way. Honestly, people think that way. There are many false teachers.

00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:50.879
The enemy is active, he's working. I'm thankful that God is working and that

00:30:50.879 --> 00:30:55.519
God is greater. But we understand that Paul says, here's the reason for this

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:58.959
conflict. It really, as you look at the whole book, he doesn't lay it out in

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:02.839
simple words in verse number one as to the real reason, but as you study the

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:06.559
entirety of the book, you'd understand that the reason that Paul has this

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:10.399
conflict is because of the false teachers that are active in all that is

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:14.319
taking place and how that they're seeking to destroy, the enemy is seeking

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:18.999
to destroy and to devour. You understand that the enemy, that he's a liar. John

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:23.719
says this in John 8 and verse number 44 as Jesus is speaking and he's speaking

00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:29.439
to these religious leaders and he says, you're of your father the devil and the

00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:33.159
lust of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode

00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:37.879
not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he

00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:43.479
speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it. I know that I've often

00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:47.479
said that false teachers, one of the things that we need to be so careful of

00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:53.079
and we need discernment, we need wisdom from God, is that they will use our

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:58.799
vocabulary but they mean something entirely different and it just takes a

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:05.559
little bit of digging to find out what they really mean and oh they will use

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:09.879
terms that perhaps you've heard and you've been familiar with but they mean

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:14.759
something entirely different and we need to be careful. We need to understand the

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:18.519
enemy is active and Paul says this is the reason that I have this conflict. As

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:22.599
we look at verses 2 and 3 this morning of Colossians chapter number 2, I would

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:29.279
say this, I would consider number 3, how to resolve this conflict. I understand

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:33.799
that the conflict will never completely be resolved until Jesus returns, until we

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:38.719
get to be with him for all of eternity because the enemy, until he is banished,

00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:42.279
until even during the millennial reign of Christ, he's banished and he's bound

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:45.719
for that thousand years but then he's loosed for a little season and the Bible

00:32:45.719 --> 00:32:49.359
tells us there's one final revolt but then in Revelation chapter number 20 in

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:52.599
verse number 10 he is cast in the lake of fire and he will burn, he'll be

00:32:52.599 --> 00:33:02.319
tormented day and night forever and ever. But I believe for Paul, I would say for

00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:07.879
myself as a spiritual leader, as I try to understand the heart of Paul and I can

00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:11.759
can really relate to Paul in the conflict that he's sharing in the great

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:16.679
concern, I can relate to understanding that which he's dealing with and

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:21.759
understanding as being an under shepherd and having the responsibility of being a

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:26.159
pastor and watching for the souls of those that God would entrust and feeding

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:30.119
the flock of God and understanding the way in which the false teachers are

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:36.079
active, I can relate to Paul. And I say as I look at verses 2 and 3 as Paul is

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:41.159
really explaining what his desire is for these believers in Colossae, no

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:45.799
doubt for those in Laodicea and for as many as have not seen his face as well,

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:52.319
we'd find that it would help to resolve this conflict at least at this level. I

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:56.799
would say to you this morning that spiritual growth is the best way to

00:33:56.799 --> 00:34:02.919
combat false teaching. Spiritual growth is the best way to combat false teaching,

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:09.799
knowing the truth. Listen to what Peter says in 2nd Peter 3 in verses 17 and 18.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:14.999
Peter says this and often we quote verse number 18 but he says in 2nd Peter 3

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:18.799
in verse number 17 as he finishes the short epistle, writing to these

00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:23.119
believers that had been scattered abroad but he speaks to them in chapter 2 about

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:27.199
the false teachers that were among them and he says this in 2nd Peter 3 in

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:36.879
verse 17, ye therefore beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware, lest ye

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:41.359
also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:48.759
steadfastness. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior

00:34:48.759 --> 00:34:56.199
Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen. What is Peter saying?

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:00.919
Those false teachers are around. They're gonna always be around and so what's the

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:05.559
best way to combat that false teaching? To grow spiritually. We have the Word of

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:10.159
God. We have the truth. Jesus said in John 17, sanctify them through Thy Word.

00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:16.519
Thy Word is truth. Aren't you thankful we have the Bible? I mean it gives us the

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:20.639
truth that we need. It gives us the ability to grow. He told them in 1st

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:25.679
Peter chapter number 2 in verse number 2, as newborn babes desire the sincere

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:31.879
milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby. It's that spiritual growth. Notice what Paul

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:38.839
says back in Colossians 2 in verse number 2. As he's expressing his desire

00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:45.679
for these believers that I believe would lead to the resolving of this conflict

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:49.959
that he was dealing with, it says that their hearts, number 1 in verse number 2

00:35:49.959 --> 00:35:54.799
there, that their hearts might be comforted. That their hearts might be

00:35:54.799 --> 00:35:58.679
comforted. This word comfort is an interesting word. We're familiar with the

00:35:58.999 --> 00:36:03.359
understand the Holy Spirit is the comforter, that our God is the God of all

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:07.599
comfort. It means to console. It also carries with it the idea of to encourage

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:13.559
and strengthen by consolation. I would believe that as I look at this passage

00:36:13.559 --> 00:36:17.319
of Scripture and read these words that their hearts might be comforted. That

00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:22.319
there was some level because of the activity of the false teachers that

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:27.199
there was some level of chaos and confusion. There was perhaps some anxiety

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:30.919
that was taking place and you understand that Paul is saying here

00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:38.599
that he is desiring that their hearts might be comforted. You think about the

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:46.839
listen false teachers are they're persistent. We know something about our

00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:58.119
enemy he's persistent is he not? He tempted the Lord Jesus Christ, God. He

00:36:58.119 --> 00:37:02.799
tempted him in the wilderness. You read the passage of Scripture and it says

00:37:02.799 --> 00:37:10.479
that he departed for a little season. Listen the enemy is persistent. You read

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:17.159
through the book of Nehemiah, Ezra. Read about the enemy in those books. I mean

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:23.039
it's persistent right? The enemy is persistent and the false teachers not

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:26.999
only they're persistent but they're persuasive. They're persistent and

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:32.079
they're persuasive. Think about all the way back in Genesis chapter number three.

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:43.039
The serpent, the most subtle beast. The Bible says this, yea hath God said. Do you

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:50.039
not think that he the enemy was persuasive in the garden? To persuade Eve

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:57.999
to partake of that fruit. He takes and he says look it's it's good for you. I mean

00:37:57.999 --> 00:38:04.879
your eyes will be open and you'll be like God. Is that it's a paraphrase but

00:38:04.879 --> 00:38:11.919
is that not what he said? He's persuasive. He's persistent. He's persuasive. The

00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:17.079
enemy is gonna try to make things look good, look appealing. That's what he does.

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:22.599
That's how he works. That's how he operates. So Paul is saying when you think about the

00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:26.719
the false teaching that is prevalent and how they're active and you understand

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:30.399
some of the the attributes of these false teachers that you would understand

00:38:30.399 --> 00:38:35.079
that there's some conflict. There's some some some anxiety. They've heard

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:39.440
this truth but now they're hearing these people come in and and maybe there's

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.679
some that are kind of siding with these false teachers and it's a causes

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:50.679
anxiety. It causes this great level of difficulty within the body of believers.

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:58.719
Why? He's seeking to divide. Paul says there in verse number two that their

00:38:58.719 --> 00:39:04.199
hearts might be comforted. I'm thankful that our God is the God of all comfort.

00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:07.919
We don't have time this morning but perhaps you'd like to write in your

00:39:07.919 --> 00:39:12.359
notes to go back to the book of 2nd Corinthians and chapter number one and

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:18.320
read of all of the way in which Paul would describe the the fact that our God

00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:22.399
is the God of all comfort. It's in 2nd Corinthians 1 verses 3 through 6 and

00:39:22.399 --> 00:39:26.039
you'll see it there and I trust that would be a blessing to you but as we

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:30.559
move on and look at what Paul says number two there in verse number two he

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:40.239
says being knit together in love. I like the phrase knit together. It gives us the

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:46.000
understanding of unity. It helps us understand this knit together in love.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.759
Remember what Jesus said in John chapter number 13 as he would give

00:39:50.759 --> 00:39:54.839
instruction to the disciples. He says a new commandment I give you that you love

00:39:54.839 --> 00:40:02.039
one another as as I have loved you. By this, by what?

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:03.679
What? Our love one for another.

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:07.039
Shall all men know that You are My disciples?

00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:10.639
And Paul says that we'd be knit together in love.

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:13.739
That there would be some unity.

00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:15.039
You'd understand this morning

00:40:15.039 --> 00:40:20.359
that unity is the result of embracing truth.

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:23.859
Unity is the result of embracing truth.

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:26.319
It is not possible that we could have

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.659
some level of unity by just simply

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:33.199
setting aside something that would divide us.

00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:36.819
It's embracing truth that brings unity.

00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:40.019
And what is that truth? It's the Word of God.

00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:42.579
And as we would embrace the truth of the Word of God,

00:40:42.579 --> 00:40:44.299
and we'd understand this morning,

00:40:44.299 --> 00:40:46.659
listen, there's a group of people,

00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:48.579
and really it's a large group of people

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.499
that would try to pretend this morning

00:40:51.499 --> 00:40:57.459
in our world that truth is relative.

00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:59.779
That's ridiculous.

00:40:59.779 --> 00:41:02.899
There's not your truth and my truth.

00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:03.939
Amen?

00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:05.819
There's truth.

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:07.539
And truth stands.

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:10.099
Truth endures.

00:41:10.099 --> 00:41:11.339
Thy Word is truth.

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:16.399
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:41:16.399 --> 00:41:19.219
There's some people that would like

00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:22.299
to pretend that truth is relative.

00:41:22.299 --> 00:41:23.699
Well, that's just their truth,

00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:25.859
and you can have your truth, and you can embrace.

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:28.619
Did that work for you in school?

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.059
When you took an exam?

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:31.899
I mean, did you ever take an exam

00:41:31.899 --> 00:41:35.579
and get a question wrong?

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:38.019
We did, right?

00:41:38.019 --> 00:41:40.099
When you put the answer on the exam,

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:42.859
did you think it was right?

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:44.259
I mean, otherwise, you probably

00:41:44.259 --> 00:41:46.579
wouldn't have put that answer.

00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:48.139
Did you argue with the professor,

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:49.219
with the teacher, and say,

00:41:49.219 --> 00:41:50.499
well, that might be your truth,

00:41:50.499 --> 00:41:54.259
but this is my truth?

00:41:54.259 --> 00:41:57.699
Ridiculous, is it not?

00:41:57.699 --> 00:42:00.259
But we pretend that that can work somehow.

00:42:00.259 --> 00:42:02.539
It can't.

00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:05.939
There's truth, and it's the Word of God.

00:42:05.939 --> 00:42:10.899
And as we embrace truth, we can have unity.

00:42:10.899 --> 00:42:14.419
The enemy seeks to divide.

00:42:14.419 --> 00:42:16.259
Notice what Paul says to the believers

00:42:16.259 --> 00:42:17.139
over in Ephesus.

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:21.539
Turn back, if you will, to Ephesians chapter number four.

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.619
Ephesians chapter number four.

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:30.299
In verse number three, Paul says this,

00:42:30.299 --> 00:42:35.619
Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:39.859
in the bond of peace.

00:42:39.859 --> 00:42:42.059
The idea of endeavoring is the idea

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:43.619
of laboring for something,

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:47.339
desiring it and being diligent to get it.

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:49.019
But the reality is that when he speaks

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:50.899
about this truth of endeavoring

00:42:50.979 --> 00:42:53.139
to keep the unity of the Spirit

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:54.299
in the bond of peace,

00:42:54.299 --> 00:42:58.699
it's as we hold dear to the truth of this book.

00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:00.339
I've used the illustration before

00:43:00.339 --> 00:43:01.979
of the tuning fork that would be used

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.139
to tune a piano.

00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:06.139
And if you use the same tuning fork,

00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:08.059
and you can travel large distances

00:43:08.059 --> 00:43:10.179
from one piano to the next piano,

00:43:10.179 --> 00:43:11.979
but if you use the same instrument,

00:43:11.979 --> 00:43:13.539
that same tuning fork,

00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:15.179
and you tune those pianos,

00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:18.099
though they're distanced apart from one another,

00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:20.339
they will have the same sound.

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:23.859
Why? Because you use the same tuning fork.

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:25.659
It's just the way it works.

00:43:25.659 --> 00:43:28.099
What's our quote-unquote tuning fork?

00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:30.419
The Word of God.

00:43:30.419 --> 00:43:31.819
We can have unity with believers

00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:33.619
in all sorts of different cultures

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:35.419
and countries around the world.

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:37.459
Why? Because we embrace the truth

00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:41.299
of God's Word, and it leads to unity.

00:43:41.299 --> 00:43:44.219
We find even there in the book of Philippians,

00:43:44.219 --> 00:43:45.579
we see here in the book of Ephesians,

00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:46.139
he speaks of it.

00:43:46.259 --> 00:43:51.179
Look in Philippians 2.

00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:58.139
In Philippians 2, in verse 1,

00:43:58.139 --> 00:43:58.579
Paul says,

00:43:58.579 --> 00:44:01.379
"...if there be therefore any consolation in Christ,

00:44:01.379 --> 00:44:02.459
if any comfort of love,

00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:03.659
if any fellowship of the Spirit,

00:44:03.659 --> 00:44:04.899
if any bowels and mercies,

00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:07.379
fulfill ye my joy,

00:44:07.379 --> 00:44:09.939
that ye be like-minded,

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:11.059
having the same love,

00:44:11.059 --> 00:44:13.499
being of one accord and of one mind."

00:44:13.499 --> 00:44:14.779
How do we accomplish that?

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:19.099
We all come from different backgrounds.

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:20.459
Our mind is transformed

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:23.979
by the truth of God's Word.

00:44:23.979 --> 00:44:25.659
Paul says in Romans 12

00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:27.019
that we're not to be conformed to this world,

00:44:27.019 --> 00:44:28.339
but that we're to be transformed

00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:31.499
by the renewing of your mind.

00:44:31.499 --> 00:44:33.739
That's how we can have unity.

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:35.779
Though we come from various backgrounds,

00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:38.219
though we've had different influences in our life,

00:44:38.219 --> 00:44:40.219
when we allow the Word of God

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.899
to do what only God's Word can do

00:44:42.939 --> 00:44:45.019
in the lives of His people,

00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:46.059
it brings unity.

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:49.179
It allows us to be like-minded.

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:50.539
Not that we're robots.

00:44:50.539 --> 00:44:52.619
Not that we're just a bunch of people

00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:56.939
following aimlessly and mindlessly.

00:44:56.939 --> 00:44:58.139
No, no.

00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:00.739
We've examined this book!

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:03.819
And we hold it dear and we hold it true.

00:45:03.819 --> 00:45:06.539
And it brings unity.

00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:07.059
Some people say,

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:09.339
oh, you guys are a bunch of puppets.

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:09.899
No, no, no.

00:45:09.899 --> 00:45:12.579
We just have the same truth.

00:45:12.579 --> 00:45:14.019
Amen?

00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:16.859
Look at verse number three.

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:19.579
Let nothing be done

00:45:19.579 --> 00:45:21.259
through strife or vainglory,

00:45:21.259 --> 00:45:22.619
but in lowliness of mind

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.379
let each esteem other better than themselves.

00:45:24.379 --> 00:45:25.859
Look not every man on his own things,

00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:27.579
but every man also on the things of others.

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:29.259
Notice verse number five.

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.299
Let this mind be in you,

00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:33.019
which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:34.379
We need to have the mind of Christ.

00:45:34.379 --> 00:45:35.659
He goes on to explain.

00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:38.099
We don't have time to look at all of that this morning,

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:40.259
but we find that we can have unity

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.979
as we embrace truth.

00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:43.419
Here in the book of Colossians,

00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:45.899
we find that he speaks about unity

00:45:45.899 --> 00:45:46.859
to these believers.

00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:48.739
And he says in this passage

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:49.779
that we're studying this morning

00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:50.939
in chapter two and verse number two,

00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:54.779
being knit together in love.

00:45:54.779 --> 00:45:59.299
I like the imagery of being knit together.

00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:00.699
That bond of love

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:03.099
as we would embrace the truth.

00:46:03.099 --> 00:46:04.419
Now you understand this morning

00:46:04.419 --> 00:46:06.339
that as the people of God,

00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:07.419
that there are some people

00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:09.139
that are a little further along

00:46:09.259 --> 00:46:13.379
in their journey with God than you may be.

00:46:13.379 --> 00:46:15.699
Amen?

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:18.099
And as that would be the case,

00:46:18.099 --> 00:46:19.779
it's through that humility

00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:22.099
that Paul spoke of to the believers in Philippi

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:23.579
that would enable us to be able

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:26.019
to effectively minister to those individuals

00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:29.259
and see them grow in grace and knowledge

00:46:29.259 --> 00:46:32.059
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:46:32.059 --> 00:46:36.259
Colossians 2, look at the rest of verse number two.

00:46:36.259 --> 00:46:37.739
We see that Paul would mention

00:46:37.739 --> 00:46:40.979
the truth of spiritual growth and maturity.

00:46:40.979 --> 00:46:42.259
It says this,

00:46:42.259 --> 00:46:44.259
"...and unto all riches

00:46:44.259 --> 00:46:46.979
of the full assurance of understanding

00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:49.339
to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.179
unto the Father and of Christ,

00:46:51.179 --> 00:46:53.619
in whom are hid all the treasures

00:46:53.619 --> 00:46:56.579
of wisdom and knowledge."

00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:58.619
As we look at the last phrase of verse number two

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:01.859
in the entirety of verse number three,

00:47:01.859 --> 00:47:04.099
we find again that this spiritual growth

00:47:04.099 --> 00:47:06.299
and maturity is in full view.

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:08.379
We find that he uses the terminology

00:47:08.379 --> 00:47:09.579
in verse number two,

00:47:09.579 --> 00:47:11.019
notice what he says,

00:47:11.019 --> 00:47:14.899
"...the full assurance of understanding."

00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:17.899
I'm thankful that we have the whole Bible.

00:47:17.899 --> 00:47:19.499
The whole canon of Scripture.

00:47:19.499 --> 00:47:22.899
Listen, if there's something that you don't know

00:47:22.899 --> 00:47:24.859
that God hasn't told us,

00:47:24.859 --> 00:47:26.659
there's no person that's going to give you

00:47:26.659 --> 00:47:29.499
some extra revelation.

00:47:29.499 --> 00:47:31.819
That's what the false teachers want to say.

00:47:31.819 --> 00:47:32.619
Right?

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:35.579
But God said, the book is finished.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:38.179
His Word is settled in heaven.

00:47:38.179 --> 00:47:39.979
We're not looking for any new revelation,

00:47:39.979 --> 00:47:41.339
any more revelation.

00:47:41.339 --> 00:47:44.019
We have the Word of God.

00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:47.659
And he says that you can have a full assurance

00:47:47.659 --> 00:47:49.299
of understanding.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.739
Isn't that awesome?

00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:52.579
Somebody comes and says,

00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:57.259
let me give you some enlightenment.

00:47:57.259 --> 00:47:58.219
No, no.

00:47:58.219 --> 00:47:59.499
I have the Word of God.

00:47:59.499 --> 00:48:00.899
At the entrance of Thy words,

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:02.179
give it light.

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:04.059
Amen?

00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:06.699
Remind that he says,

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:09.019
"...to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God."

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.059
Again, he would use these terminologies

00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:12.819
that these false teachers would use.

00:48:12.819 --> 00:48:14.619
And he speaks again about this acknowledgment

00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:15.619
of the mystery of God.

00:48:15.619 --> 00:48:16.859
What is the mystery of God?

00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:18.259
We would find that he mentioned

00:48:18.259 --> 00:48:20.859
in chapter 1 that it's Christ in you,

00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:22.019
the hope of glory,

00:48:22.019 --> 00:48:23.859
and we studied the passage of Scripture

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:26.019
even in verse 19 of chapter 1,

00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:27.459
how that we would understand

00:48:27.459 --> 00:48:29.499
that Christ is the mystery of God

00:48:29.499 --> 00:48:32.419
in the sense that it is the Lord Jesus Christ

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:38.619
that manifests God to man.

00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:42.339
Bottom line, Christ is all I need.

00:48:42.339 --> 00:48:43.339
The songwriter said,

00:48:43.339 --> 00:48:44.380
Christ is all I need.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.459
All, all I need.

00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:50.259
We find in verse 19,

00:48:50.259 --> 00:48:52.739
it says this of chapter 1 in verse 19,

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:55.019
"...for it pleased the Father

00:48:55.019 --> 00:48:56.139
that in Him..."

00:48:56.139 --> 00:48:57.899
Who is Him? It's Christ.

00:48:57.899 --> 00:48:59.940
If you go back and look at the context,

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.820
you'll understand he's speaking of Christ.

00:49:01.859 --> 00:49:07.619
"...that in Him should all fullness dwell."

00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:09.579
Hebrews 1 speaks of the same thing.

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:11.099
We don't have time to go there.

00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:12.779
But we find that Paul is saying

00:49:12.779 --> 00:49:14.539
to these believers in Colossae,

00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:15.699
he's saying, listen,

00:49:15.699 --> 00:49:18.619
the way to resolve the conflict that I have

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:20.899
is that we would have this comfort,

00:49:20.899 --> 00:49:22.739
that we would have this encouragement

00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:24.940
and this strength by consolation

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.259
that our hearts would be knit together in love,

00:49:27.259 --> 00:49:28.500
that we would have unity,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.579
and that we would have spiritual growth

00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:32.019
and maturity.

00:49:32.019 --> 00:49:32.859
Why?

00:49:32.859 --> 00:49:36.099
Because then the false teachers have no chance.

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:39.659
Honestly, if you have a group of people,

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:41.179
if Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:43.459
we'll use ourselves as an example this morning,

00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:47.219
if we have, if our hearts are comforted,

00:49:47.219 --> 00:49:49.659
if we're encouraging and strengthening one another

00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:50.820
through this consolation,

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.699
if we have this unity

00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:55.500
because we've embraced the truth of the Word of God,

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.139
if we're growing and we have spiritual growth

00:49:58.179 --> 00:49:59.339
and maturity,

00:49:59.339 --> 00:50:01.979
and some false teacher walks in these doors.

00:50:01.979 --> 00:50:04.639
He's not going to have a chance.

00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:05.759
Amen?

00:50:05.759 --> 00:50:07.919
You understand, I'm coming off the platform, Jim.

00:50:07.919 --> 00:50:10.839
You understand this morning that false teachers,

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.599
they're not going to come talk to me

00:50:12.599 --> 00:50:15.479
about their false teaching.

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:18.319
They're going to come to Samantha.

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.479
They're going to come to some other young person

00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:21.559
in our church.

00:50:21.559 --> 00:50:22.799
They're going to come to you.

00:50:22.799 --> 00:50:24.679
They're going to try to have dinner with you.

00:50:24.679 --> 00:50:26.219
And they're going to try to introduce

00:50:26.219 --> 00:50:27.719
their false teaching.

00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:29.759
That's how they work.

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:31.339
It's what they do.

00:50:34.719 --> 00:50:38.239
It's okay that the pastor has grown spiritually

00:50:38.239 --> 00:50:40.459
and has an understanding of the Word of God,

00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:45.159
but the people have to be spiritually mature.

00:50:45.159 --> 00:50:48.299
You have to be growing in your walk with God.

00:50:48.299 --> 00:50:49.899
So that when a false teacher comes in

00:50:49.899 --> 00:50:51.499
and meets with you and you say,

00:50:51.499 --> 00:50:53.419
we don't believe that.

00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:55.019
And here's why we don't believe that,

00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:57.259
because the Word of God says,

00:50:57.259 --> 00:50:58.719
and all of a sudden, they put their tail

00:50:58.719 --> 00:51:01.239
between their knees and they go running out.

00:51:01.239 --> 00:51:02.079
Why?

00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:04.059
Because they don't want to mess with you.

00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:05.639
You know the Bible.

00:51:07.339 --> 00:51:08.299
Amen.

00:51:08.299 --> 00:51:10.679
It's the way it works.

00:51:10.679 --> 00:51:14.039
And so Paul's saying, I believe.

00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:16.779
If we're going to resolve this great conflict,

00:51:16.779 --> 00:51:18.979
man, we need to have some believers

00:51:18.979 --> 00:51:22.019
that are strong spiritually.

00:51:22.019 --> 00:51:24.019
That have unity.

00:51:24.019 --> 00:51:26.819
That are comforting and strengthening one another,

00:51:26.839 --> 00:51:29.639
encouraging one another with comfort.

00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:31.819
And as we have that,

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:33.439
those false teachers are going to go down the road

00:51:33.439 --> 00:51:35.199
and find someone else to mess with.

00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:38.999
But if we don't have that,

00:51:40.239 --> 00:51:41.639
those false teachers come in

00:51:42.759 --> 00:51:45.499
and they begin to introduce their false teaching.

00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:47.959
And they influence this family.

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:52.439
And they find this family over here to influence.

00:51:52.439 --> 00:51:54.719
And then they influence another family.

00:51:54.719 --> 00:51:57.019
They say, don't talk to pastor about this.

00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:00.899
Right?

00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:03.339
They get this family and that family,

00:52:03.339 --> 00:52:04.859
and then all of a sudden,

00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:07.919
they have this nucleus of people in a church

00:52:09.179 --> 00:52:11.539
that's all on board with what their agenda is.

00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:13.939
Do you know that you can walk,

00:52:13.939 --> 00:52:15.779
or not walk, that you could walk,

00:52:15.779 --> 00:52:18.139
but you can travel around the United States of America

00:52:18.139 --> 00:52:20.799
and you can find churches all over our land

00:52:20.799 --> 00:52:23.199
that one day stood on truth.

00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:28.739
That today look nothing like what they once stood for.

00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:29.699
Why?

00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:32.319
Because some guy came in and took it captive.

00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:35.579
It happens.

00:52:35.579 --> 00:52:37.699
Do your research.

00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:39.019
Happens all the time.

00:52:40.579 --> 00:52:44.499
Why is it that we watch for your souls as spiritual leaders?

00:52:44.499 --> 00:52:47.859
Why is it that we're instructed to feed the flock of God

00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:50.819
so that we can be spiritually mature?

00:52:51.819 --> 00:52:53.119
So that we can be strengthened

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.239
against the attack of the enemy?

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:57.559
So that we can stand for truth?

00:52:59.239 --> 00:53:01.639
We find this morning that Paul says,

00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:03.359
I have this great conflict.

00:53:04.519 --> 00:53:06.259
I have this great conflict.

00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:09.239
And I believe this morning that

00:53:09.239 --> 00:53:12.039
if the people of God would get serious

00:53:12.039 --> 00:53:14.359
about knowing God and his word,

00:53:15.519 --> 00:53:17.919
we could see some resolution, if you will,

00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:20.039
to this great conflict.

00:53:20.059 --> 00:53:20.879
Why?

00:53:20.879 --> 00:53:23.419
Because the spiritual leader can kind of take,

00:53:23.419 --> 00:53:27.059
if you will, not that he's going to be negligent

00:53:27.059 --> 00:53:29.299
in any of his duties or responsibilities,

00:53:30.139 --> 00:53:32.099
but he can have an assurance that

00:53:33.339 --> 00:53:35.459
the people that God's called me to lead,

00:53:37.659 --> 00:53:41.419
they're solid, they know the word of God,

00:53:41.419 --> 00:53:43.179
and they're gonna be able to stand.

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:49.139
See, this morning, we've mentioned the reason

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:50.839
for this conflict.

00:53:51.959 --> 00:53:56.279
And we've acknowledged that the enemy's still working today.

00:53:56.279 --> 00:53:58.039
The enemy is active, he's working.

00:53:58.999 --> 00:54:01.199
And the question that I'd ask myself

00:54:01.199 --> 00:54:03.679
and I'd ask you this morning,

00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:05.179
are you growing?

00:54:05.179 --> 00:54:06.259
Are you grounded?

00:54:07.639 --> 00:54:10.599
Can you give a defense of your faith?

00:54:12.139 --> 00:54:14.119
Are you able to go to the word of God

00:54:14.119 --> 00:54:17.519
and understand, thus saith the Lord?

00:54:17.519 --> 00:54:19.199
That's what God's word says.

00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:21.859
See, that we would be growing.

00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:23.579
Why is Paul saying, I'm warning every man

00:54:23.579 --> 00:54:25.539
and teaching every man?

00:54:25.539 --> 00:54:28.419
Because he understands the false teachers are active.

00:54:28.419 --> 00:54:30.579
And as we teach the word of God,

00:54:31.759 --> 00:54:34.979
oh, God will help us to be strengthened.

00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:37.739
And we can know what God's word says.

00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:39.579
When that enemy comes, that false teacher,

00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:41.059
that email that somebody sends you,

00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:44.139
hey, look what I found online, it's great, isn't it?

00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:46.339
So actually, it's not true, and here's why.

00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:49.899
I know that's not popular.

00:54:49.899 --> 00:54:51.579
I understand that.

00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:54.579
But we better be grounded and settled

00:54:54.579 --> 00:54:56.819
on the truth of God's word.

00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:58.899
Paul's great conflict.

00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:00.419
This morning, I believe that there are many

00:55:00.419 --> 00:55:02.339
spiritual leaders all across this land

00:55:03.219 --> 00:55:05.619
that are in the same situation that Paul was in.

00:55:06.659 --> 00:55:09.299
There's a concern that we have for the people of God.

00:55:11.139 --> 00:55:13.179
Why do we teach the word of God?

00:55:13.179 --> 00:55:16.139
Desire to give truth, service after service,

00:55:16.159 --> 00:55:18.799
week after week, because we know

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:20.959
that there are false teachers that abound.

00:55:21.959 --> 00:55:25.839
It's God's plan that we would be grounded,

00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:27.839
that we would not be tossed to and fro

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:29.759
with any wind of doctrine, as Paul says

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:31.719
to the leaders in Ephesus.

00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:34.119
No, no, here's what God's word says.

00:55:34.119 --> 00:55:36.239
This morning, how are you growing?

00:55:37.279 --> 00:55:38.919
Are you growing?

00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:41.199
I'm not asking you to tell me,

00:55:41.199 --> 00:55:42.759
but I'm asking you to evaluate your own life.

00:55:42.759 --> 00:55:44.359
Are you growing?

00:55:44.379 --> 00:55:46.379
How are you growing?

00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:47.939
Do you wanna grow?

00:55:47.939 --> 00:55:49.739
Is there that desire?

00:55:50.579 --> 00:55:55.579
Oh, if there is, outside of the services

00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:58.179
that we have weekly, getting active and involved

00:55:58.179 --> 00:56:00.019
in those services and hearing the teaching

00:56:00.019 --> 00:56:01.139
and preaching of the word of God.

00:56:01.139 --> 00:56:02.899
You know, I don't preach the same message tonight

00:56:02.899 --> 00:56:04.659
that I preached this morning.

00:56:04.659 --> 00:56:06.939
I preached an entirely different message.

00:56:06.939 --> 00:56:08.379
I don't preach the same message on Wednesday

00:56:08.379 --> 00:56:09.219
that I preached on Sunday.

00:56:09.219 --> 00:56:10.939
It's an entirely different message.

00:56:11.759 --> 00:56:14.839
So that we can get the truth of God's word

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:16.859
into the hearts of God's people.

00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:20.119
So that we can be strengthened and prepared

00:56:20.119 --> 00:56:22.239
for the attack of the enemy.

00:56:22.239 --> 00:56:23.079
Amen, let's pray.

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:23.959
Father, we love you.

00:56:24.879 --> 00:56:26.339
We thank you for loving us.

00:56:27.479 --> 00:56:28.799
Thank you for truth.

00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:34.899
I pray, God, this morning that you would help us to stand.

00:56:35.899 --> 00:56:40.899
Help us to be spiritually growing, mature believers.

00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.759
That the false teacher that would seek

00:56:49.759 --> 00:56:52.559
to infiltrate this congregation

00:56:53.999 --> 00:56:58.679
would meet a group of people that are settled

00:56:58.679 --> 00:57:00.799
and grounded on the truth.

00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:03.159
That know the word of God.

00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:10.239
We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:57:11.199 --> 00:57:13.219
We thank you for the word of God.

00:57:14.479 --> 00:57:17.079
I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven,

00:57:18.719 --> 00:57:22.879
maybe they've been influenced by some false teaching

00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:29.199
that would deny the person of Jesus Christ as being God.

00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:31.899
Perhaps they would deny the teaching

00:57:31.899 --> 00:57:36.079
that thy word is sufficient and it's all we need.

00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:38.159
We're not looking for any new revelation,

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:39.679
any more revelation.

00:57:41.879 --> 00:57:43.279
Perhaps they've been influenced

00:57:43.279 --> 00:57:45.699
by some other form of false teaching.

00:57:48.139 --> 00:57:49.499
They've never trusted Christ.

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:52.719
I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:55.179
They'd understand that Jesus Christ is God.

00:57:57.359 --> 00:58:00.919
He came to this world at the appointed time

00:58:00.939 --> 00:58:02.419
when the fullness of time was come.

00:58:02.419 --> 00:58:03.939
God sent forth His Son.

00:58:06.179 --> 00:58:09.659
He was born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life,

00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:12.499
bled and died to be our substitute,

00:58:13.419 --> 00:58:16.959
buried and rose in victory,

00:58:16.959 --> 00:58:18.859
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:58:20.179 --> 00:58:21.659
He's the Savior of the world.

00:58:23.359 --> 00:58:25.459
I pray that this morning,

00:58:25.459 --> 00:58:27.859
that individual that may not know you

00:58:27.859 --> 00:58:30.859
would trust Christ today.

00:58:32.039 --> 00:58:35.119
For each believer, Lord, help us to grow.

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.239
Help us to not get comfortable.

00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:40.000
Help us to not get stagnant,

00:58:41.079 --> 00:58:44.019
self-sufficient, self-dependent.

00:58:44.019 --> 00:58:45.880
Help us, God, to be eager,

00:58:47.959 --> 00:58:51.039
to hunger and thirst for the word of God,

00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:54.719
to know you, as Paul said.

00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:57.599
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:58:58.119 --> 00:59:00.320
That's why we do these efforts in Christ's name we pray.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.380
Would you stand with me?

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.239
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:05.739
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:59:05.739 --> 00:59:08.820
Perhaps you need to come and ask the Lord to help you.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.260
Perhaps there's some that would come

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.019
and pray for our church as a whole.

00:59:13.019 --> 00:59:16.380
God would protect us and strengthen us.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.899
Need some men to come and pray for our congregation.

00:59:19.899 --> 00:59:21.859
The enemy's active.

00:59:21.859 --> 00:59:24.779
As Kimberly plays, would you allow the Holy Spirit of God

00:59:24.779 --> 00:59:26.239
to have His way in your life?
