1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
Wednesday evening as well, and I'll be looking at a passage of Scripture here in Leviticus

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,440
chapter number 25.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,840
And I do trust that the study in the Word of God this evening will be an encouragement

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
to you.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,559
I also pray that God would use it to challenge us in our walk with Him, and I'm so thankful

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:24,360
the Word of God tells us that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,280
And what a blessing to know that the Word of God helps us, and it gives us encouragement

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,599
when we need encouragement, it comforts our hearts when we're troubled, it gives us challenge

9
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:39,119
and conviction, and what a blessing to have the Bible.

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,759
And I know that for many of us this evening, as soon as I say take your Bible and turn

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,720
the book of Leviticus, you have a Bible with you.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,759
And what a great privilege that is for us to have the Word of God.

13
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,439
There are many people groups around the world today that do not have a Bible, and I'm so

14
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,919
thankful for the Word of God.

15
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:02,080
Leviticus chapter 25, I'll read a few verses of Scripture, and then we'll get into the

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,239
message this evening, beginning in verse number 1 of Leviticus 25.

17
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,239
The Bible says this,

18
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:15,040
And the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,040
and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,919
a sabbath unto the Lord.

21
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:27,319
We'll read down through verse number 7 as we study this evening, but we'll also be looking

22
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,279
at verses 18 through 22, and I want to draw your attention to verse number 20.

23
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,919
The Bible says this,

24
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:37,440
And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,919
Behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase.

26
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,720
I'd like to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled from verse number

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,680
20, What shall we eat the seventh year?

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,220
What shall we eat the seventh year?

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,959
As you study the Word of God, it will not take you long to recognize that there is an

30
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,879
emphasis within God's Word placed upon faith and obedience.

31
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,000
We understand that our God has given us valuable instruction.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,080
He's given us a perfect, precious book that we hold dear, and contained within this book,

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
the pages of this book, are instructions for our daily living.

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,639
It is in our best interest to take heed to what thus saith the Lord.

35
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,240
We understand that He has provided great detail, not only in the Old Testament, even as we'll

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,000
look here this evening, with regard to some things for the children of Israel, but for

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,639
the people of God as we begin to look at principles and study commands that are given to us in

38
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,240
the New Testament as the church.

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,399
We understand this evening that God has given us His Word, and He's placed a premium upon

40
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,800
obedience.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,080
We understand that Moses would say, obviously, the Lord is speaking to the children of Israel,

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,240
but in the book of Deuteronomy, as God would use Moses to pen that book, the Bible says

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,160
that I lay before you today a blessing and a curse, a blessing if you obey, a curse if

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
you disobey.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
And so we find that God has placed a premium on obedience.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,360
But we also find that as we study the Word of God, that we as God's people are to live

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
by faith.

48
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,559
We're to live by faith.

49
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:22,479
And we understand that that statement is used repeatedly throughout the Word of God.

50
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,639
We find it in the Old Testament, the book of Habakkuk.

51
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,360
We find it in the book of Romans, the book of Galatians, and then also in the book of

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Hebrews, where God says that we are to live by faith.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,960
We understand that the writer of Hebrews says in Hebrews 11 and verse number 6 that without

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,000
faith it is impossible to please Him, to please God, for he that cometh to God must believe

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,520
that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,279
So we find that this subject matter of faith is of serious importance.

57
00:03:54,279 --> 00:04:00,880
And we understand that as God is speaking to Moses in the book of Numbers in chapter

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,119
14 and verse number 11, if you want the reference, but God is speaking to Moses and that passage

59
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:10,960
of Scripture is dealing with the return of the spies.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,279
Do you remember the 12 spies were sent out and they're returning?

61
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,440
And of course the 10 bring an evil report.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,399
The people don't obey the Lord.

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,679
They don't have any faith in God giving them the land.

64
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,920
And God says this to Moses.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,720
He says, how long will it be ere they believe me?

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,920
For all the signs which I have showed among them.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,519
How long will it be ere they believe me?

68
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,679
God wants his people to believe him.

69
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,519
He wants his people to live by faith.

70
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,279
Listen, our God is trustworthy.

71
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,279
He is dependable.

72
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,799
Great is thy faithfulness.

73
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:56,040
And we understand that our God is faithful, that all of his, he's given us so many promises

74
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,480
and Peter refers to them as being exceeding great and precious promises.

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,959
And we find that all that God has promised he is able to fulfill.

76
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Amen?

77
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,559
And as we look at this passage of Scripture here in Leviticus chapter number 25, we obviously

78
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:19,239
understand that the specifics of this chapter were given to the children of Israel in preparation

79
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,720
for their entrance into the land.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,279
However, as the emphasis in this passage I believe would be upon faith and obedience

81
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,600
as we've been discussing by way of introduction, I believe that these are principles that remain

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,839
applicable in our lives today.

83
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,040
And as we look at this Old Testament example and we understand some of what God was giving

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,519
his people, we understand for us this evening that there is still a need for us to obey

85
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,239
God and to live by faith, to trust him, to trust him.

86
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:56,279
Notice what the Scriptures say if you're taking notes in verses 1-7 of Leviticus 25, I want

87
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,459
you to consider the plan of God.

88
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,920
Now you understand that God's plan is not always your plan.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,239
Amen?

90
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:09,760
God has given a plan for the children of Israel in preparation for entrance into the land,

91
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,079
and his plan is the way it's supposed to work.

92
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,079
Amen?

93
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,160
His plan doesn't need to be improved upon.

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,839
His plan doesn't need to be upgraded or updated.

95
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,160
No, his plan is his plan, and he is the eternal God, and he has given a plan, and in this

96
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,799
plan, in these first seven verses, as we dig in, we will find that there is for the children

97
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:38,600
of Israel this aspect of faith and obedience is quite obvious.

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,899
What's in light here, what we're dealing with is obviously the instruction concerning the

99
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,440
Sabbath year.

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,920
Notice with me again in verse number 2, God is speaking in verse number 1, he's speaking

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,160
to Moses and says, say this to the children of Israel, and notice in verse number 2, speak

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,760
unto the children of Israel and say unto them, when ye come into the land which I give you.

103
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Don't you like how that's phrased?

104
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,920
This wasn't a question of if you're going to come into the land, but when you come into

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,519
the land that I give you.

106
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,880
God had made that promise all the way back to Abraham, and he had repeated that promise

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,839
many times through the patriarchs, and he says here that when ye come into the land

108
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,239
which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.

109
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:32,239
Now notice in verse number 3, six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt

110
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:37,679
prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof.

111
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:43,760
As we begin to look at the plan of God, we find that God will give specific instruction

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,679
with regard to his plan for his people with regard to the land.

113
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:55,279
During these first six years, as you would look at a calendar of time, if you will, they

114
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:02,000
had the responsibility of cultivating the land, planting, sowing the seed, and then

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,279
reaping a harvest.

116
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,399
And we find that God gives them the instruction of gathering the fruit thereof in verse number

117
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:15,920
3 during that six year period of time, but then you find in verse number 4 that he says,

118
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:25,000
In the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land, a Sabbath for the Lord.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

120
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,359
That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather

121
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:40,760
the grapes of thy vine undressed, for it is a year of rest unto the land.

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,039
And the Sabbath of the land shall be meet for you, for thee, and for thy servant, and

123
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,200
for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with

124
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
thee.

125
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,599
And for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof

126
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,599
be meet.

127
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:01,919
As you begin to look at this plan that God is revealing to his people, and you find that

128
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,520
here God is giving them this instruction with regard to for six years, here's what you do.

129
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,520
But on the seventh year, things are going to change.

130
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,159
It's very similar to what you see with the manna, with the gathering of the manna, remember?

131
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,739
God had promised that he would give them bread from heaven, and he gave specific instruction

132
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:25,640
that for six days you go out and you gather, and you gather a certain amount, and you better

133
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,960
be careful though not to store any up, because if you do and you leave it until morning it's

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,760
going to stink and it's going to breed worms, and so there was specific instruction that

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,440
was given.

136
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,479
But even in that, on day number six, what were they supposed to do?

137
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,479
Well, they were supposed to gather twice as much on day number six.

138
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:48,719
But on day number four, if they gathered twice as much, it's going to stink and breed worms.

139
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:55,479
But on day number six, if they gathered twice as much, in obedience to God and by faith

140
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:59,559
in what God has said, it didn't spoil.

141
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,080
It didn't stink.

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
it didn't breed worms and there were some people on day number seven maybe

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,520
some of those same guys that gathered twice as much on day two or three and

144
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,360
said I don't like that stench and I don't like those worms and so on day

145
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,520
number seven they went out looking to gather some manna what happened there's

146
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,640
no manna because God says I'm gonna come on day seven you know for 40 years they

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,680
had manna in that fashion it's building their faith and now when we come to this

148
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,080
instruction with regard to the Sabbath year for six years you're going to take

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,120
care of your land you're gonna cultivate it you're gonna sow the seed you're

150
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:49,000
going to to reap the harvest but in year number seven it's a it's a year of rest

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,240
for the land for the animals and for you and for the servants now you can go a

152
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,600
day without eating right if you fail to obey the instruction with regard to the

153
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,000
the manna in a in a week and you just mess it all up and you can go a day

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
without eating I don't think you can go a year without eating I know some people

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,040
that have fasted for a week or a couple of weeks and in the New Testament speaks

156
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,720
about Jesus for 40 days in the wilderness but 365 days without eating

157
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
that's a long time you're not you're gonna die but this is the plan that God

158
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,560
gave in that seventh year it's a year of rest now when you think about that you

159
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
consider the plan I I believe this evening and I don't want to get into it

160
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,880
but this plan certainly had a purpose agriculturally there were benefits and

161
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,200
so on and so forth agriculturally for the land and all of that but I believe

162
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:05,600
that the most significant purpose was in proving or in developing his people and

163
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,120
giving them this instruction and saying are you gonna obey me are you going to

164
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,760
have faith that I am able and so we consider the plan and as I look at the

165
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,400
plan in these first seven verses and then in verse number eight it goes into

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,680
the year of Jubilee and the 50th year and I don't intend in any way shape or

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,840
form to to skim over those verses to to give you the impression that they're not

168
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,520
important because they are but sticking within this seventh year this year of

169
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,080
rest we'll skip down to verse number 18 and kind of follow in with the the

170
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,880
dialogue if you will with regard to this seventh year this Sabbath year and

171
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,800
notice in verse number 18 the Bible says wherefore you shall do my statutes

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,080
and keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land and safety

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,240
and the land shall yield her fruit and you shall eat your fill and dwell there

174
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,720
and in safety now look in verse number 20 our God is so gracious he really is

175
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,880
in verse number 20 God in his omniscience he says in verse number 20

176
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,520
and if you shall say what shall we eat the seventh year now God knows us he

177
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,680
made us he knows that we're but dust he knows our frame and by the way I

178
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,920
probably would have been one of those people saying what are we gonna eat in

179
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,420
the seventh year and if you'd be honest maybe you would be too it's a valid

180
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,920
question is it not and here's the beautiful thing about the Word of God

181
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,360
and the the grace of our God and just the the way in which he's given us his

182
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
word and he's provided us with all that we need the Bible says that as far as

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
New Testament believers are concerned we look in the New Testament that he has

184
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,240
given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness he has given us

185
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,240
everything that we need we are seated in the heavenlies and we find here that God

186
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,440
says that if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not

187
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,800
sow nor gather in our increase and if you're a analytical kind of a person as

188
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,760
I would be I would look at that in that fashion I'd say okay so we're not

189
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,800
supposed to sow we're not supposed to gather for an entire year what are we

190
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,040
gonna do what are we gonna do and we consider the plan of God but then we

191
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,040
note if you're taking notes number two consider the promise of God now this is

192
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,520
an amazing truth as I look at this passage of scripture and I begin to

193
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,120
just meditate upon the truth of the Word of God the reality is that God does

194
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,160
not owe us an explanation amen he really doesn't he could simply say listen for

195
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,960
six years this is what you do on the seventh year this is what you do period

196
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:03,600
end of story obey me he's God but God knows our frame he knows that we're but

197
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,040
dust and here in this passage of scripture he's going to give the

198
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:17,640
children of Israel a promise that is amazing in verse number 21 I love just

199
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:27,320
the verbiage in verse 21 it says then I will command my blessing upon you in the

200
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,880
sixth year now can you can you get your mind around that statement we'll read

201
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,240
the rest of the verse in just a moment but get your mind around the statement

202
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:44,040
that God is making that he the Lord God omnipotent Jehovah is going to command

203
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,960
his blessing upon you in the sixth year the God that spoke everything into

204
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,480
existence the God who said let there be light and there was light the God who as

205
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,520
the record is given to us in Genesis said and he made the stars also but

206
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,120
they're beyond our ability to even come close to numbering the God that created

207
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,280
all things the God who is the the Redeemer of mankind he says that he will

208
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:19,240
command his blessing upon you that's encouraging I mean when you begin to to

209
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,000
look at this and you begin to think about the fact of okay we're gonna do

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,320
this for six years and then this what we're supposed to do in the seventh year

211
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,320
and you're thinking to yourself we're not supposed to so we're not supposed to

212
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,000
gather so what is it that we're going to eat and God says I will command my

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,520
blessing upon you I will command my blessing upon you and my mind's eye and

214
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,000
my sanctified imagination I begin to think about the Lord God Almighty and

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,960
how he would command you know nature obeys God the only thing in God's

216
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,920
creation that does not automatically obey him is mankind aren't you thankful

217
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:08,560
that the whale obeyed God I know Jonah was amen after right God told the whale

218
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:15,520
to spew him out I'm pretty sure that Jonah was happy that that whale obeyed

219
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,520
better than he did right because how did Jonah obey he didn't do so good in Jonah

220
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,920
chapter number one right he went the opposite way he paid the fare to get

221
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,920
away from doing what God had caught him to do but when God spoke to that whale

222
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,320
it obeyed when God says he's gonna command his blessing in the fashion in

223
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,800
the manner in which he says he's going to command it you can rest assured that

224
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,120
it's going to happen and the Bible says here here's what he's gonna do I'm gonna

225
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,080
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year it's a promise of provision

226
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,880
the details are provided the Bible says this and it shall bring forth fruit for

227
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:08,080
three years it shall he didn't say it might he said it shall it shall bring

228
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,600
forth fruit for three years now what does that mean well he gives further

229
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,640
detail in verse number 22 to how this is going to work and ye shall sow the

230
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,560
eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits

231
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:34,559
come in ye shall eat of the old store so in the sixth year God says he's going to

232
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,360
command his blessing upon them and the land would bring forth fruit for three

233
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,040
years so they would eat that fruit in year number six and year number seven

234
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,920
and year number eight and year number seven they're not sowing they're not

235
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,920
cultivating they're not reaping but in year number eight they now can plant

236
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,799
again they can they can sow the seed again in year number eight but as you

237
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,000
know when you plant the seed you don't reap a harvest immediately there's a

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,320
period of time that must take place and so God says I'm going to give you three

239
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,559
years worth so that in that eighth year when you're able to start cultivating

240
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,080
and planting but it's not producing yet you still have sustenance and then as

241
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,080
that crop begins to come in then that which I commanded my blessing will go

242
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,360
away now think about that this is powerful truth that God is giving again

243
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,720
yes there's some agricultural impacts and certainly as God the Creator he

244
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,000
understood what those benefits would be to the land but you see how God is

245
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,880
proving his people how he's seeking to develop his people that for six years

246
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,559
you're going to do this but in the seventh year you're not going to do

247
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,880
anything because here's what I'm going to do as we think about this passage of

248
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,400
scripture

249
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
When we think about those two statements

250
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,660
that I made in the beginning

251
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,880
by way of introduction,

252
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,240
that the emphasis throughout the Word of God

253
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,920
that is placed upon those two themes

254
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,360
or those two topics,

255
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,420
one of obedience and another of faith.

256
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you not see it in the passage of Scripture?

257
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
It would require obedience

258
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,320
to the plan of God in the first seven verses,

259
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,920
but that obedience requires faith

260
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,480
that God's going to do what God said He's going to do.

261
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,120
Sometimes, we struggle in the area of our faith.

262
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,080
Is God really going to do what God said He was going to do?

263
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,600
Do we really have faith to live by faith?

264
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Jesus said multiple times

265
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,960
and I actually preached some messages on this last year,

266
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,080
there were times during His earthly ministry

267
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,560
when He said, how is it that you have no faith?

268
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,920
Right?

269
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,460
And then there were other times where He said,

270
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,580
I found so great faith in all of Israel.

271
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,380
You know what the Bible says about the return of Christ?

272
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,340
The Son of Man find faith.

273
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,140
The reality is that we're to live by faith.

274
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,460
We're to trust God, believe Him.

275
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,500
Now, as we keep in mind this passage of Scripture,

276
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,820
the context of the Scripture,

277
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,940
and of course, understanding the truth

278
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,900
for the children of Israel for preparation

279
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,580
as they would enter the land,

280
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,060
I want you to consider that during the wilderness wanderings,

281
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,400
during that period of time

282
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,660
in which they were going through after their disobedience,

283
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,620
you understand that at this point,

284
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,900
they had not yet sent the spies.

285
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,620
That whole thing of the disobedience

286
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,140
has not taken place yet and they're going to wander

287
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,020
and God is going to provide food for them

288
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,700
for that entire duration.

289
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,140
And turn over to Joshua 5, if you will.

290
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,540
And I want you to notice what the Word of God says

291
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,380
in Joshua 5.

292
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,620
Of course, that generation that did not believe God,

293
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,380
they died and Joshua and Caleb

294
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
are going to enter the land.

295
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,540
Of course, Joshua will be the human leader

296
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
of the nation of Israel.

297
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,180
And in Joshua 5, the Bible gives us the record

298
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,840
of when that manna would cease to produce.

299
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,100
And I want you to see what God did.

300
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,220
Now, as you understand the wilderness wanderings

301
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,980
and you understand as you would trace

302
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,980
the steps of the wilderness wanderings,

303
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,460
that they just wandered around.

304
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,340
I mean, it almost, if you were to draw it all out

305
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,220
on a map, they're crisscrossing

306
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,660
and they're all over the place.

307
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,940
When is it that they left?

308
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,340
Well, remember when that pillar of cloud

309
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,420
that was by day and the pillar of fire

310
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,180
that was by night on the tabernacle,

311
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,660
when it would remove, what'd they do?

312
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,860
They would move and they would follow it.

313
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,300
So they didn't have any time to be planting

314
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,540
and cultivating and reaping a harvest.

315
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,820
They were constantly moving.

316
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,140
And so God gave them manna.

317
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,820
When they get into the land,

318
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,340
the Bible tells us in verse number 10 of Joshua 5,

319
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,100
the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal

320
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,300
and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month

321
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,700
at even in the plains of Jericho.

322
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,260
And they did eat of the old corn of the land

323
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,980
on the morrow after the Passover,

324
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,100
unleavened cakes and parts corn in the self same day.

325
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,420
Notice this, the manna ceased on the morrow

326
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,860
after they had eaten of the old corn of the land.

327
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,020
Neither had the children of Israel manna anymore,

328
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,500
but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan

329
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,620
that year.

330
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,980
God provided for them.

331
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,340
God took care.

332
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,180
Listen, does God know what we need?

333
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,220
Absolutely.

334
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,420
You know, Matthew 6 says,

335
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,020
turn over there very quickly, if you would,

336
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,140
Matthew chapter number six.

337
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,100
And you look in this passage

338
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,340
and you find great promises and great truth

339
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,780
that would encourage the people of God.

340
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,460
But think of this one statement

341
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,980
in verse number eight of Matthew chapter number six.

342
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,900
The Bible says this,

343
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
be not ye therefore like unto them.

344
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,260
He's speaking about those Pharisees

345
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,860
and those religious leaders that were praying

346
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,020
as hypocrites and using vain repetition

347
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,900
and so on and so forth.

348
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
He says this,

349
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,900
for your father knoweth what things you have need of

350
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,060
before you ask him.

351
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,020
Isn't that encouraging?

352
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Isn't it comforting?

353
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,260
Juliana told me this afternoon,

354
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,380
she said, daddy, I have a question for you.

355
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,700
And before she could get two words of her question out,

356
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
I gave her the answer.

357
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,340
And she says, how did you know what I was gonna ask?

358
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,220
Well, it's not because I'm omniscient.

359
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,500
I just knew some things that were going on.

360
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,340
But the reality is that our heavenly father is omniscient.

361
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
He knows everything.

362
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,460
He knows what we need.

363
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,020
He made us and in making us,

364
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,100
he made us need food, right?

365
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
The end of Matthew chapter number six,

366
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
when it speaks about the food and the water

367
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,380
and the rain and so on and so forth,

368
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,740
he says, listen, God knows that you have need

369
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,140
of these things.

370
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740
He's gonna provide them for you.

371
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,220
The thing that's sad for me,

372
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,020
and I won't focus upon it for the intent

373
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,820
of the message this evening is really to encourage us

374
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,660
to have faith in God and to obey His plan.

375
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Unfortunately, as you would study the history of Israel

376
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,940
from all that we can gather,

377
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,300
you would find that the children of Israel

378
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,780
never consistently obeyed the instruction

379
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,740
that we read in Leviticus 25.

380
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,300
I find two sad results of that.

381
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,940
Number one, they missed out on seeing God work.

382
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,940
They missed out on seeing what God could do

383
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,260
because they didn't obey and they didn't have faith.

384
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,260
You know, when we lack faith in our lives,

385
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,860
we miss out on seeing what God can do.

386
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,580
Why did He not do many mighty works there?

387
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,420
Because of their unbelief.

388
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,420
Because of their unbelief, their lack of faith.

389
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,780
That's what the Bible says of Jesus

390
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,860
during His earthly ministry.

391
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,100
He did not many mighty works there.

392
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
Why?

393
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,180
Because of their unbelief.

394
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,580
I don't wanna miss out on what God is able to do in my life.

395
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,380
I wanna have faith in what God said that He is going to do

396
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,340
because our God is able.

397
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,980
Not only did they miss out on seeing what God was able to do

398
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,940
but the reality is they face judgment

399
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,500
for their disobedience.

400
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,420
In obedience, we get to see what God is able to do.

401
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,380
In disobedience, not only do we miss out

402
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,460
on seeing what God's gonna do

403
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,300
but then we have to face judgment.

404
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,260
And a couple of passages later

405
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,860
in Leviticus chapter number 26,

406
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,420
we are in 25, it's a lengthy passage

407
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,780
but in Leviticus 26 in verses 33 and 34,

408
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,460
I want you to see what God says

409
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,100
and really if you look at all of the chapter 26,

410
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,300
you'll see just the obedience.

411
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,180
If you walk in my statutes and keep them,

412
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,020
then here's what I'm going to do.

413
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,060
If you don't hearken unto me,

414
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,540
then here's what's going to happen.

415
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,700
If then kind of statements, if you will.

416
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,780
And if you look in verse 33 of Leviticus 26,

417
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,980
the Bible says this,

418
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,140
and I will scatter you among the heathen

419
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,700
and will draw out a sword after you

420
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,420
and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.

421
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,660
Then shall the land enjoy her Sabbaths

422
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,740
as long as it lieth desolate

423
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,980
and ye be in your enemy's land.

424
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,580
Even then shall the land rest and enjoy her Sabbaths.

425
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,460
That's exactly what happened

426
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,740
during the Babylonian captivity.

427
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,620
It was 70 years because of a lack of obedience

428
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,100
to this particular instruction

429
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,820
that we're reading of in Leviticus 25.

430
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,540
If you look over at 2 Chronicles 36,

431
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,460
notice, and we'll finish up here in just a few moments,

432
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,700
but I want you to notice what the Bible says

433
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,420
in 2 Chronicles 36 and verse 21.

434
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,860
Remember, God gave them the instruction,

435
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,980
the emphasis upon faith and obedience.

436
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,260
We do not see anywhere historically

437
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,140
where they consistently obeyed the Lord

438
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,620
with regard to this instruction.

439
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,100
God said, if you disobey, here's what's gonna happen

440
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,060
because my land will get its Sabbaths.

441
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,340
In 2 Chronicles 36 and verse number 21,

442
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,580
the Bible says to fulfill the word of the Lord

443
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,940
by the mouth of Jeremiah

444
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,940
until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths.

445
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,740
For as long as she lay desolate,

446
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,540
she kept Sabbath to fulfill threescore and 10 years.

447
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,720
We know that a remnant would return.

448
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
This evening, I understand we're not the children of Israel

449
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,200
and we're not entering into a land.

450
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
I understand that we're not planting

451
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,200
and reaping for six years

452
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,160
and then letting it sit for a rest for a seventh year.

453
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,680
I understand that.

454
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,559
But there are principles in the word of God

455
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,480
with regard to God's instruction,

456
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
God's commandments for us as the people of God.

457
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,040
The question that I would ask is,

458
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,640
how are we doing in the area of obedience?

459
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,080
In the area of faith?

460
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,960
If we were to be alive during this time,

461
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,200
during the time of the Exodus,

462
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,400
this great host of people that left the land of Egypt

463
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,200
and saw the mighty hand of God,

464
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,559
would we have asked,

465
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,200
as we use for our title this evening,

466
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,280
what shall we eat the seventh year?

467
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Perhaps we would.

468
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,680
But when we receive that promise of God,

469
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,200
would we embrace that promise?

470
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,480
Would we have faith and believe that God is able to do?

471
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,680
See, our God is able to provide water from a rock.

472
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
Amen?

473
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,880
He's able to bring meat by a raven.

474
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,200
Right?

475
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,080
He's able.

476
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
And as we begin to think about our lives

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,040
and the instruction of the word of God,

478
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,640
oh, that we would just determine

479
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
that we're going to obey him.

480
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,080
faith that God is able to do what he's promised to do. He's gonna take care of

481
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,560
us because he's a good God. He's promised to do so. All of his promises are yay.

482
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,600
Amen? There's times, no doubt in your life, that you made a promise to someone.

483
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,360
Anyone ever make a promise to someone and then you couldn't fulfill it? I

484
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,600
learned my lesson when Juliana was about two years old as a parent. I was working

485
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,040
and I told her, I know I've told the story before, I told her that on

486
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,440
Saturday we would go to the park and do X Y & Z and blah blah blah and so on and

487
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,600
so forth. She had been wanting to do it and it was kind of that time of year

488
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,160
where it gets dark early. You know when you go to work it's dark, when you come

489
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,680
home it's dark. That kind of almost what we're looking at right now. And I told

490
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,640
her on Saturday we'll do these things. And on Saturday it just poured and

491
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,720
poured and poured. It was just a terrible day. We couldn't go to the park. But I had

492
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,600
told Juliana I promise on Saturday we'll do it. And as a two, two and a half

493
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,080
year old girl she just said, but daddy you promised. I don't have any control

494
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,880
over the weather though. I mean like I can't I can't make it stop raining. But I

495
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,320
learned a lesson then not to say I promise to do things that I can't make

496
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,800
good on that promise. But you understand that when God has promised to do

497
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:33,840
something, he's able. He is able. We say as we look to this night, obviously

498
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,000
Wednesday night's our prayer time. We think about our prayer time here in just

499
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,200
a moment. He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or

500
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,120
think. Ephesians 3 and verse number 20. That's our God. We just need to trust

501
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,400
him and obey him. We sing the song trust and obey. There's no other way to be

502
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:57,760
happy in Jesus but to trust and obey. Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank

503
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,280
you for loving us. We thank you for the opportunity to study your Word. This Old

504
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:09,000
Testament passage has specifics with regard to their preparation for entering

505
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,080
the land. But the principles of faith and obedience are so clear in this passage.

506
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:28,360
I pray God that you would help us to obey you, to trust you, to have faith in what

507
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,360
only you could do. We thank you for the many promises that you've given us in

508
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,080
your Word. We pray God that you'd bless our time of prayer. We pray that you

509
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,720
would encourage us and strengthen us and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name

510
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,200
we pray. Amen.
