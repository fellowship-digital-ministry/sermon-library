1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
some folks visiting with us this morning.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,940
Patricia's joining us again,

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,780
and Rob is here with us as well,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,779
and certainly thankful for folks that are visiting.

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,920
Good to see the Salgados this morning,

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,779
and looking forward to seeing Emery.

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,579
I'm sure he's getting nice and big,

8
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:16,500
and good to see you folks this morning.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,100
Nehemiah chapter number six,

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,940
and we'll be looking at this portion of scripture.

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,620
Let me just give you a little bit of background

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,700
before we get into the passage this morning.

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,620
Of course, as you know,

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,700
Judah had been taken captive by the Babylonians,

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,200
and after that captivity,

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,479
we understand that they spent 70 years in exile

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,360
before Cyrus came to the throne,

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,220
and Cyrus made a decree that the Jewish people

19
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,139
could return to the land of their homeland,

20
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:44,119
to the city of Jerusalem particularly,

21
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,439
and we find that it's in the book of Ezra

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,520
that God records for us and provides for us

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,759
the details regarding the return,

24
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,599
and obviously the building of the temple

25
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,720
is found in the book of Ezra,

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,439
and you can read and study and see all that God does,

27
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,900
revival, and so on and so forth,

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,540
and we find that as we come to the book of Nehemiah,

29
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,139
that it's in that same time frame,

30
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:09,180
obviously several years after Ezra and that group,

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,860
that original group had returned to Jerusalem,

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,220
and many years later, we find that Nehemiah

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,260
in chapter number one is found in Shushan,

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,779
and he's serving the king Artaxerxes,

35
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,500
and we find that he's in that place,

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,699
and he's the cupbearer for Artaxerxes,

37
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,819
and chapter number one tells us

38
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:30,000
that he has some correspondence with Hanani,

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,839
and the specifics of that correspondence

40
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:36,519
dealt with the situation in Jerusalem.

41
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,160
He asked specifically, how are things in Jerusalem?

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,800
Give me a report as to what's going on there,

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,519
and we find that Hanani delivers to Nehemiah this report

44
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,760
with regard to the great affliction and the reproach.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,839
He tells him that the wall of Jerusalem

46
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,480
also is broken down,

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,400
and the gates thereof are burned with fire,

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,839
and we find that Nehemiah, as he received that report

49
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,800
after that correspondence with Hanani,

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,240
we find that he was very burdened

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
for the situation in Jerusalem.

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,559
We find that he immediately went to God in prayer,

53
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,199
and he began to seek the face of God,

54
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,600
and we find that chapter number two tells us

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,440
that he was in the presence of Artaxerxes,

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,479
and prior to this particular event,

57
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,880
he had not been sad in the presence of Artaxerxes,

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,679
but Artaxerxes could see in his countenance

59
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,559
that he was sad, and he said, what is it?

60
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:34,080
This is nothing more than sorrow of heart,

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,199
and we find that Nehemiah reveals to the king

62
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,399
that which he had heard and understood,

63
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:44,360
and permission is granted for Nehemiah to return.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,600
As you read the rest of chapter number two,

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,979
you find that Nehemiah gets back to the city,

66
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,059
and he, on his own, upon arrival,

67
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,779
he goes and he views the city,

68
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,779
and he's taking everything in,

69
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:59,139
and he's seeing firsthand exactly what Hanani

70
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,300
had described to him in that correspondence

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,539
in chapter number one,

72
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,740
and we find that Nehemiah then issues a challenge

73
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,220
to the people of God, those that were there,

74
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,580
and he tells them, let's rise up and build.

75
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,779
The good hand of the Lord is upon me.

76
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,779
And he understood there was a work to be done,

77
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,539
and we find that immediately upon the challenge

78
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,020
being issued in Nehemiah chapter number two,

79
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,020
the opposition also is there.

80
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,059
I mean, immediately upon Nehemiah saying,

81
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:33,259
let us rise up and build,

82
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,020
the Bible tells us that Sanballat and Tobiah

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,199
were there ready to oppose the work of God.

84
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,979
Chapter three, four, and five provide us for a record

85
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,619
not only of those that were there

86
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,619
in chapter number three extensively,

87
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,740
but chapters four and five reveal to us

88
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,699
the work that is being carried on

89
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,100
and the opposition that they're facing.

90
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,820
When we come to chapter number six specifically,

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,259
we find that I believe that the enemy begins

92
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,860
to really up their game, so to speak.

93
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,179
And we find that as we look at chapter number six

94
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,979
and dive into this passage this morning,

95
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,860
I'm trusting that God will help to equip

96
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,019
and strengthen us as the people of God,

97
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,059
even as the enemy would seek to derail us.

98
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:24,299
We find that it's here in chapter number six

99
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,579
in verse number one.

100
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,179
It says, now it came to pass

101
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:30,660
when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian

102
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,059
and the rest of our enemies heard

103
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,019
that I had builded the wall

104
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,779
and that there was no breach left therein,

105
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,739
and though it says there are parentheses

106
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:39,660
at the end of verse number one,

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,059
though at that time I had not set up

108
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,179
the doors upon the gates,

109
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,899
notice verse two, that Sanballat and Geshem

110
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,700
sent unto me saying,

111
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,579
come, let us meet together in some one of the villages

112
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,700
in the plain of Ono.

113
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,019
But they thought to do me mischief.

114
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,179
If you've already looked at the back

115
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:00,059
of the bulletin this morning,

116
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,100
the title is found here in verse number two

117
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,980
for our message this morning.

118
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,299
They thought to do me mischief.

119
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:13,940
That word mischief is often translated as evil.

120
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,980
Not that mischief is a wrong translation of the word,

121
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
but it's synonymous,

122
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,700
and we understand that it's translated various ways,

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,420
but the mischief that was intended to be done

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,700
against Nehemiah and those that were doing the work,

125
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,100
they had evil intentions against the man of God

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,660
and the work of God.

127
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,179
I believe that as we look here

128
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,540
at this passage of Scripture,

129
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,980
there's some things that we need to learn

130
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,540
if you're taking notes, number one,

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,579
we need to learn to recognize the enemy.

132
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,660
We need to learn to recognize the enemy.

133
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,739
Now understand that by this time,

134
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:47,339
I mean, Nehemiah had been working

135
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,579
and Nehemiah had been enduring some opposition,

136
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,299
adversity, and hardship,

137
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,059
and we can read of that in chapters,

138
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,579
really the end of chapter two,

139
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,779
three, four, and five,

140
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,579
really four and five capture a lot of it, most of it.

141
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,859
And so we find that by this time,

142
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:03,059
Nehemiah had been very familiar

143
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,739
with who his enemies were.

144
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,179
In verse number one, in fact,

145
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,859
the Bible says that it came to pass

146
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:11,220
when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian,

147
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,059
notice what he says,

148
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,779
and the rest of our enemies.

149
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,339
And so Nehemiah at this particular time of his ministry,

150
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:22,380
he was able to easily identify who his enemies were.

151
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,899
But I want you to understand

152
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,839
that though the opposition to the work of God

153
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,700
began immediately,

154
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,059
I find that as I read Nehemiah chapter number six,

155
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,420
that we discover that the enemy

156
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,899
is increasing their deception.

157
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,179
See, Sanballat and Tobiah were constantly

158
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,220
in chapters four and five coming and saying things,

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,299
let us join with you,

160
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,339
and if a fox goes up on it, it's gonna crumble,

161
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,540
and I mean, all of the ridicule

162
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,339
and all of the things that they said.

163
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,899
But now in chapter number six,

164
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:57,779
the level of deception increases exponentially.

165
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,420
And it's important as we study

166
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,459
through chapter number six this morning

167
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,079
that we find that Nehemiah was able

168
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,019
to consistently recognize the enemy.

169
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,140
Can I tell you this morning

170
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,660
that the enemy doesn't always show up

171
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,179
by saying, I'm your enemy.

172
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:14,660
In fact, it's very rare

173
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,700
that an enemy would show up that way, right?

174
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,920
And so we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

175
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,839
that the deception is increasing.

176
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,540
Remember what the word of God says

177
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,059
in the book of Ephesians in chapter number six,

178
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:31,380
and we studied this book a few years ago in its entirety,

179
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,220
but we find in Ephesians chapter number six

180
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,859
in verse number 10,

181
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,739
Paul says this to the believers in Ephesus,

182
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,140
finally, my brethren,

183
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,260
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

184
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,420
Put on the whole armor of God

185
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
that you may be able to stand

186
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,700
against the wiles of the devil.

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,980
That word wiles, it carries with it

188
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,980
the idea of deceit, deception, craftiness, tricky.

189
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,299
Remember that it says of the serpent

190
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,839
in Genesis chapter number three,

191
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,779
that he was more subtle than any beast of the field.

192
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,420
We find that it's in verse number 12

193
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,260
of the same passage in Ephesians six

194
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,500
that Paul says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

195
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,619
but against principalities, against powers,

196
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,980
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

197
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,600
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

198
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,140
I believe that as we look here in Nehemiah chapter number six

199
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,859
it reminds me as we think about the deception increasing

200
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,580
and we think about the attacks

201
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,280
in which Nehemiah would deal with

202
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,780
the opposition to the work,

203
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,239
it reminds me of what we read back in the book of Numbers

204
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,960
under the counsel of Balaam.

205
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,039
Remember that Balaam could not curse the people of God.

206
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,960
Though Balak wanted him to,

207
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,820
we find that it was through the counsel of Balaam

208
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,960
that he encouraged the people of God to corrupt themselves.

209
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,539
You can read that in Numbers 31 and verse number 16.

210
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,840
We also find that it's very similar to what you read of

211
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,280
in the book of Joshua in the ninth chapter

212
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,159
with the deception of the Gibeonites.

213
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,659
And we find that our enemy is going to consistently

214
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,599
and regularly increase the deception

215
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,760
because he's our enemy.

216
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,520
Understand as we look at this point this morning

217
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,679
that we need to learn to recognize the enemy,

218
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,880
we need to understand the objective of the enemy.

219
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,159
I mean, ultimately their objective is to destroy the work.

220
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,119
And that's what they'd like to do.

221
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:35,400
But I believe that the enemy, though he understands,

222
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,440
and we'll look at some promises at the end of the message

223
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,880
this morning, the work of God will march on.

224
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,099
I believe that where he finds great satisfaction

225
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,640
is in hindering the work of God.

226
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,299
Hindering the work of God.

227
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,559
That's exactly what the enemy had been trying to do

228
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,080
in chapters four and five.

229
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,039
And now in chapter number six,

230
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,119
we find that the enemy recognizes

231
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,539
that the building is continuing to go on.

232
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,159
I mean, the wall is near completion.

233
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,539
It says that the doors had not yet been set up upon the gates,

234
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,719
but we find that they're nearing completion.

235
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,799
And so the enemy is going to elevate and increase

236
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,119
the level of deception.

237
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:18,279
And they're going to come and try to hinder the work.

238
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,599
So what do they do?

239
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,279
We understand what their objective is,

240
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,679
but look at what the method is that's employed in Nehemiah

241
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,759
chapter number 6.

242
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,719
First, we find in verses 2 through 4

243
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:32,279
that there is a request for a meeting in one of the villages.

244
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,679
The Bible says in verse number 2,

245
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,559
come let us meet together in some one of the villages

246
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,559
in the plain of Ono.

247
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,159
Notice what Nehemiah says, but they thought to do me mischief.

248
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,519
And so they desired to have this meeting.

249
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,039
No doubt, I believe that if this meeting would have taken place,

250
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,039
they would have sought to intimidate Nehemiah

251
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,479
from continuing with the work.

252
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,239
I believe that really another plan of these individuals

253
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,119
was to get Nehemiah distracted from the work,

254
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,959
remove him from the work he was doing.

255
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,799
Notice what he says in verse number 3,

256
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,639
and I sent messengers unto them saying,

257
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,439
I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down.

258
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:18,919
Why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you?

259
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,959
See, the enemy wants the work to cease.

260
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,479
He wants to hinder the work.

261
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,199
And so let's remove Nehemiah.

262
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,839
And Nehemiah was used by God in an amazing way

263
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,919
to lead these people that are rebuilding the walls.

264
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,119
And so the enemy is coming and trying

265
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:35,959
to get the leader to be removed and to go to this meeting

266
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,599
that they set up in this plain.

267
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,199
Notice what the Bible says that after Nehemiah sent messengers

268
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,839
unto them, that in verse number 4,

269
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,479
the Bible says, yet they sent unto me

270
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,639
four times after this sort.

271
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,759
And I answered them after the same matter.

272
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,039
The enemy is persistent.

273
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,519
The enemy is persistent.

274
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,799
We often can use the word that he's relentless.

275
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,279
We find the enemy in his persistence.

276
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,439
We find it on four times this first option

277
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:08,039
of having Nehemiah leave Jerusalem

278
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,319
and go into one of these villages, this place

279
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:13,159
in the plain of Ono, so that they could have this meeting

280
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,919
and seek to cause the work of God

281
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,159
to cease, to hinder the work of God,

282
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,720
to intimidate the man of God.

283
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,599
But it did not work.

284
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:25,199
So we notice method number 2 in our passage of Scripture

285
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,599
in verses 5 through 9.

286
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,679
We find that they send an open letter.

287
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,919
An open letter.

288
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,639
You know, really what they're doing here

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,360
is they're lying about the motive of Nehemiah.

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,799
They're slandering the name of Nehemiah.

291
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,599
They send an open letter so that it can be read

292
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,919
by more than just Nehemiah.

293
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,799
In the previous section, the first approach

294
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,879
in seeking to have him meet, the Bible

295
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,559
says that verse 2, that Sanballat and Geshem

296
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,399
sent unto Me.

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,319
So they go directly to Nehemiah.

298
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,119
They want a meeting with you over here.

299
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,599
Now we find in verse number 5 that it says,

300
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,759
then sent Sanballat his servant unto Me

301
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,399
in like manner the fifth time with an open letter

302
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,879
in his hand, desiring that others

303
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,360
within the city of Jerusalem would read this

304
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,159
and they would have the opportunity

305
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,440
to influence other people.

306
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,759
And look at what the letter says.

307
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,599
Verse 6, wherein was written,

308
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,959
it is reported among the heathen,

309
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,919
and Gashemus saith it, that thou and the Jews

310
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,080
think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall,

311
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,519
notice this, that thou mayest be their king,

312
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,039
according to these words.

313
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,479
So what are they saying?

314
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:46,360
Nehemiah, you want to be the king.

315
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,720
You have selfish motives.

316
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,239
You're coming in there and you want to be the king.

317
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,599
You want to be the leader.

318
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,559
And you want to be the king in verse number 7.

319
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,519
And thou hast also appointed prophets

320
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,399
to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,

321
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,599
there is a king in Judah.

322
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:08,080
And so this is the attempt, the way in which the enemy is

323
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,399
going to try to deal with this now in this open letter

324
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,639
and seeking to influence others to rebel against Nehemiah

325
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,000
and seeking to undermine the character of this man.

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,679
There is a king in Judah, verse 7,

327
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,799
and now shall it be reported to the king according

328
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,359
to these words.

329
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,679
Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together.

330
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,679
So here's what they do.

331
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,639
They say, we know this is what you want to do.

332
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,839
And they're trying to influence, but not only

333
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
in influencing the others, but they're now saying,

334
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,119
we're going to go to the king, Artaxerxes.

335
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,639
And we're going to tell him that you

336
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,919
are going to rebel against him and you want to be the king.

337
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,880
Now, Nehemiah had a good relationship with Artaxerxes.

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,720
He was his cupbearer.

339
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,639
In chapter number 2, you see the interaction.

340
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,239
And we find that the enemy is seeking,

341
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,839
through various levels of deception,

342
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,720
as they would elevate.

343
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,880
It's not now just Sanballat and Tobiah that are coming

344
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,119
and trying to attack Nehemiah.

345
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:06,279
They give these invitations, and now they send this open letter.

346
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,399
Let's get some other people riled up against them.

347
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
Let's have the influence of the people

348
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,359
so that he would not be able to continue the work.

349
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:18,440
We find that not only that, the third level of deception

350
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,239
that we find is recorded for us in verses 10 through 14.

351
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,600
Look at what happens now.

352
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,239
Again, the enemy continues to elevate

353
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,559
the level of deception.

354
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,720
It says afterward, in verse number 10,

355
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,079
I came unto the house of Shemaiah, the son of Deliah,

356
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,519
the son of Mehedabiel, who was shut up.

357
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,000
And he said, let us meet together in the house of God,

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
within the temple.

359
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,519
And let us shut the doors of the temple.

360
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,799
Why?

361
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,959
For they will come to slay thee.

362
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,760
Yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

363
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,239
So now this fellow says to Nehemiah,

364
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,160
Nehemiah, they're going to come kill you.

365
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,799
The only place that you can find refuge is in the temple.

366
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,720
Now that would've been a problem for Nehemiah

367
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,440
to go into the temple.

368
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
It seems very obvious through the passage of scripture

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,919
that the recommendation was to go into the holy place.

370
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,479
He wasn't permitted to go into the holy of holies.

371
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:24,359
And it was as if the enemy now, notice what the Bible says,

372
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,239
that Nehemiah replies and says, look at verse number 11.

373
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,119
Should such a man as I flee, and who

374
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,479
is there that being as I am, would go into the temple

375
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,239
to save his life?

376
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,119
I will not go in.

377
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,679
And lo, notice this word, circle it, underline it,

378
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:46,600
I perceived, I perceived that God had not sent him,

379
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,519
but that he pronounced this prophecy against me,

380
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,760
notice this, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

381
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
What level of deception.

382
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,079
The influence that they had these enemies,

383
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,519
the way in which, and we'll notice

384
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,679
at the end of the passage, they infiltrate.

385
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,279
And they now get this man, according

386
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,919
to what we see in verse number 10,

387
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,639
to come and to say to Nehemiah that he, this is Shemiah,

388
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,160
as we notice in verse number 10, Shemiah says, hey listen,

389
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,239
they're going to come and kill you,

390
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,320
and so you need to go over here and hide yourself,

391
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,119
protect yourself.

392
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,639
It's where you'd find refuge.

393
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,720
And we find that really their intent,

394
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,660
as Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him,

395
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,380
notice what it says in verse number 13,

396
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,779
therefore was he hired that I should be afraid and do so.

397
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:35,299
Do what?

398
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,500
Go into that place that he was not permitted to go into

399
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:47,179
and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report

400
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,059
that they might reproach me.

401
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,979
Oh, the enemy is, he's crafting.

402
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,059
Hey listen, Nehemiah, they're going to kill you.

403
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:56,979
They're going to come at night and they're

404
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:57,419
going to kill you.

405
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,859
The only place you can find refuge

406
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:01,820
is in the place where you're not permitted to go.

407
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,859
But if you go in that place, then you'll have refuge.

408
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,619
You'll have safety.

409
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,100
But in going to that place, they then

410
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
are going to say, oh, you went to where

411
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,220
you weren't supposed to go.

412
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,579
You sinned.

413
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,779
Now they can bring up an evil report

414
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,519
and they can bring reproach against Nehemiah.

415
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,540
It's crazy, but that's how the enemy works.

416
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,579
We see it right here in Nehemiah chapter number 6.

417
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,260
Notice how they, at the end of the passage in verses 17

418
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,739
through 19, notice their approach of infiltration,

419
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,380
as I have referred to it as.

420
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,460
We find that verse 17 says, moreover, in those days,

421
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,900
the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah.

422
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,339
The nobles of Judah.

423
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:46,779
They're sending letters to Tobiah.

424
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,419
Who's Tobiah?

425
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,900
He's the enemy.

426
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,260
Notice what it says.

427
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,979
And the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

428
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,779
So these fellows are corresponding one

429
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,059
with another.

430
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:04,859
Verse 18, for there were many in Judah, many, sworn unto him.

431
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:05,460
Why?

432
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,460
Because he was the son-in-law of Shekeniah, the son of Arah.

433
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,099
And his son, Johanan, had taken the daughter of Meshulam,

434
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,299
the son of Berechiah.

435
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,580
So through these relationships, through his wife

436
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,779
and his daughter-in-law, he's now infiltrated.

437
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,940
And he has the ear of the nobles of Judah.

438
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,539
And they're corresponding one with the other.

439
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,020
It tells us in verse number 19, also,

440
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,099
they reported his good deeds before me

441
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,059
and uttered my words to him.

442
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,940
And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

443
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,339
The enemy is tricky.

444
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,460
He's deceitful.

445
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,299
And he has no morals.

446
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,979
He's relentless, and he's ruthless.

447
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:59,859
And he will do whatever is necessary to hinder

448
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,900
the work of God.

449
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:11,140
of God. Whatever. Because He's evil. And this enemy, these enemies, we see that

450
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,940
when they were not able to be successful in the end of chapter number two, the

451
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,540
first approach was, hey, let us join you. Verses chapters four and five, all of the

452
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,380
ways in which they sought to cause the work of God to hinder, and now in chapter

453
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:34,020
six we see the level of deception rise exponentially. They hire a man that's

454
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,740
supposed to be a priest. They infiltrate the ranks of the nobles of Judah

455
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,620
through relationship so that they can have influence. Wow. And I want you to pay

456
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:53,600
particular attention to how the enemy would use fear. It's very interesting in

457
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,560
this passage of Scripture how the enemy will use fear. Notice in verse number

458
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,560
nine. Verse eight, I didn't read verses eight and nine, we'll get to that in just a

459
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,880
moment, but it says in verse eight, Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such

460
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,360
things done as thou sayest, but thou faintest them out of thine own heart. For

461
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,800
they all, notice what it says, made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be

462
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,560
weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my

463
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,520
hands. So the first reference to fear or being afraid is in verse number nine,

464
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:32,240
They all made us afraid. Notice verse number 13, Therefore was he hired that I

465
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:40,160
should be afraid and do so. So we find in verse number nine this thing of fear, we

466
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,000
find in verse number 13 this thing of fear, and at the end of verse number 18,

467
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,200
19, excuse me, it says, Also that reported his good deeds before me and uttered my

468
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,720
words to him, and Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. You know why the enemy

469
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,640
uses fear? Because the enemy uses fear, and I believe that when he can make the

470
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,520
people of God afraid, he can cause us to do things that otherwise we would not do.

471
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,600
Don't keep doing this work because here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna

472
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,960
kill you, we're gonna imprison you, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, and

473
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm afraid, right? They said in verse number 13, He was hired to tell me that

474
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,480
they were gonna come and kill me so that I would be afraid and do so, go into the

475
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,400
place where I was not permitted to go. And so the enemy is gonna use fear, the

476
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,740
enemy continues to use fear, and the enemy uses fear, and I believe that as he

477
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,280
would make people afraid, that he can be successful, at least in his

478
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,980
objective, to hinder the work of God. To hinder the work of God. I'm afraid to do

479
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,520
this, I'm afraid to do that, I'm afraid to go here, I'm afraid to go there. And the

480
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,320
work of God is hindered because of fear. And here in Nehemiah chapter number six,

481
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,540
on three occasions we find that the enemy specifically, the four methods are

482
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,000
outlined, I would submit to you that even though the Bible doesn't say in the

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,560
first four verses of chapter number six that they were trying to make him afraid

484
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,080
in that meeting as well. I mean, when he says that they thought to do mischief to

485
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,880
me, or they thought to do to me mischief, obviously they were trying to make him

486
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,160
afraid. So the enemy wants to cause the people of God to be fearful so that the

487
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,720
work of God would be hindered, so the work of God would cease from going

488
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,040
forward. And so this morning, I believe that as we look at Nehemiah chapter

489
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,680
number six, the first reality, the first thing that we need to learn is we need

490
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,520
to learn how to recognize the enemy. And I submit to you this morning that it's

491
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,240
not always easy to recognize the enemy. Look at the methods that are used in

492
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,960
this portion of Scripture, the extent in which the enemy would go to deceive you,

493
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:57,600
to deceive me. We find that we need to learn to recognize the enemy. Number two,

494
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,600
we need to learn to resist the enemy. We need to learn to resist the enemy. Notice,

495
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,880
you can hold your place here Nehemiah, but I want you to be mindful of what

496
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,360
James says in James 4 and verse number 7. In James 4 and verse number 7, the

497
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,120
Bible says this, submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil, and he

498
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,560
will flee from you. That's a great promise of God's Word, is it not? Listen,

499
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,320
before you resist the enemy, you need to submit to God. That's the formula. Submit

500
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,880
to God, submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee

501
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,360
from you. As we submit ourselves to God and we're filled with the power of the

502
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,800
Holy Spirit of God, then we have the ability to be able to resist the enemy,

503
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,120
and we have the promise that the enemy is going to flee. See, the devil don't

504
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,200
want to mess with the Lord. He wants to mess with you, in your flesh, because he

505
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,600
can be successful. Amen? I want you to notice on the four methods that were

506
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,080
employed in Nehemiah chapter number 6, I want you to notice how Nehemiah

507
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,200
responds to each of those situations, but before we look at that specifically in

508
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Nehemiah chapter number 6, I want you to note that Nehemiah was a man of prayer.

509
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,720
Nehemiah is a man of prayer, and I believe that that's such a key for us to

510
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,320
see how that he had the level of perception and discernment to be able to

511
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,160
recognize the enemy in chapter number 6, because he was a man of prayer. He's

512
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,560
submitting to God. He's a man of prayer. Notice in Nehemiah chapter number 1, we

513
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,120
don't have time to read the entirety of it, but in verse number 4 is when you

514
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,440
begin to see where Nehemiah prays. It goes all the way through the end of

515
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,180
chapter number 1, there in verse number 11, but notice what it says in Nehemiah 1

516
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,700
in verse 4, and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and

517
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:54,820
wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.

518
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,540
Listen, I'm glad that he wept and I'm glad that he mourned, but had he not

519
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,340
fasted and prayed, we may not see the same results that we see here in Nehemiah.

520
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,220
We find that, yes, we can weep for our nation, we can mourn for the report that

521
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,900
we hear, but we better seek the face of God. We need a revival of prayer. We find,

522
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,100
again, I don't have time to read the entirety of the next verses, read it

523
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,500
later, but through the end of verse number 11, we find that Nehemiah is

524
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,460
praying, and what a great prayer it is. A prayer of intercession, a prayer of

525
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,220
confession, the sins of the people. I mean, he's serious in his prayer. We find

526
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,540
that in Nehemiah chapter number 2, after Artaxerxes sees that he has nothing

527
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,420
more but sorrow of heart, and he says to him, you know, what do you want? And look

528
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,940
at verse number 4, then the king said unto me, for what dost thou make request?

529
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,580
And then notice the last part of verse number 4, so I prayed to the God of

530
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:02,420
heaven, and I said unto the king, to start verse number 5, can I tell you that it's

531
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:08,220
not always the length of your prayer? Notice the scene in Nehemiah chapter

532
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,020
number 2. Artaxerxes says, hey, I notice your countenance. This is nothing more

533
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,740
than sorrow of heart. What is it that you request? And before he answered the king,

534
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,660
it says that he prayed to God. What a great truth. Nehemiah's a man of prayer.

535
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,540
Not only there, notice in chapter number 4. Chapter number 3 deals with the work

536
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,140
being assigned and all of the people that were there, and chapter number 4,

537
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,900
again, the work being attacked and all that's going on. Notice in verse number

538
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,140
8 of Nehemiah 4, the Bible says, and conspired all of them together to come

539
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,100
and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it. Nevertheless, verse number 9 of

540
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,220
Nehemiah 4, we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and

541
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,580
night because of them. What's the response? Pray. He's a man of prayer. In our

542
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,460
chapter, in Nehemiah chapter number 6, the chapter in which we're studying this

543
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,220
morning, we find that in verse number 9, the last phrase of the verse says,

544
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:12,260
Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. I mean, that's a short prayer, is it not?

545
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,980
But he was a man that communed with the Lord. He was a man of prayer. And so when he's

546
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,860
facing this situation and they're trying to weaken their hands, they're trying to

547
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,780
discourage them and cause them to be feared so that the work would be hindered, we find

548
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:35,260
that Nehemiah prays, Strengthen my hands. In verse number 14, we find that he

549
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,900
prays, it says, My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sandalit, according to these

550
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,940
their works, and on the prophets Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would

551
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,500
have, the prophetess Noadiah, excuse me, and the rest of the prophets that would

552
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:56,619
have put me in fear. Another reference to fear. We find that Nehemiah was a man of

553
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:01,540
prayer, but how did he deal with the methods? How did he deal with the attack? Well, number

554
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,420
one, they invited him to go to one of the villages in the plain of Ono, and I would

555
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:12,540
say this, that Nehemiah rejected the invitation. He rejected the invitation. Sometimes we ought

556
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,220
to say no. I've often said from Nehemiah chapter number 6, they invited him to Ono,

557
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,220
and he said, Oh no, amen. I ain't going there. I'm not leaving the work. Why should

558
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:29,820
the work cease? Why should it be hindered? No, I'm not going. We've got to learn how

559
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,300
to say no. Amen? Well, but they invited me, and they're going to think I'm going to...

560
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:47,619
Learn to say no. Amen? Honestly. No appearance of evil. Sometimes they're inviting you to

561
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:55,300
go to that place so they can slander you, like they were trying to do to Nehemiah. Right?

562
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,660
Not only did he reject the invitation, he refuted the claim. In the claim of verse 6

563
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,940
and 7, in that open letter...

564
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,140
was that Nehemiah wanted to be the king.

565
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,980
He refuted that.

566
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,220
V. 8, he says,

567
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,800
"...then I sent unto them, saying,

568
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,560
there are no such things done as thou sayest,

569
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,340
but thou faintest them out of thine own heart."

570
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,700
You're just making this stuff up.

571
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,840
No truth to what you're claiming whatsoever.

572
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,240
He refuted the claim.

573
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,440
He resisted the suggestion.

574
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,060
When the man comes, Shemaiah,

575
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,660
and says, hey, you need to go into the temple.

576
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,460
These are going to come and kill you, slay you.

577
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,820
He resisted that suggestion.

578
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,340
He was able to have perception.

579
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,180
And I believe that in v. 12

580
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,620
when he says, lo, I perceived,

581
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,340
it's that level of having that discernment

582
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,660
that only God gives.

583
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,700
And say, no, I'm not permitted to do that.

584
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,780
And notice what he says in v. 11.

585
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,980
I mean, think about it.

586
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,460
He's saying they're going to come.

587
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,340
In the night will they come to slay thee?

588
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,380
At the end of v. 10.

589
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
And notice what Nehemiah says in v. 11.

590
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,180
Should such a man as I flee?

591
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,860
Think about what he just prayed in v. 9.

592
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,660
Oh God, strengthen my hands.

593
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,220
Nehemiah, they're going to come kill you,

594
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,180
and then I run in fear.

595
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,139
No, no, no.

596
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,740
I just prayed that God would strengthen me.

597
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,180
Should such a man as I flee?

598
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,420
And who is there that being as I am

599
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,620
would go into the temple to save his life?

600
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,819
I will not go in.

601
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,540
I like his resolve.

602
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,660
I believe that Nehemiah remained steadfast.

603
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,459
As we think about that infiltration

604
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,779
that was mentioned in v. 17-19

605
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,779
and the relationship of Tobiah

606
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,620
with the nobles of Judah

607
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,580
through his wife and his daughter-in-law,

608
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,779
and all of the letters that would go back and forth,

609
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:51,540
I believe that Nehemiah, he remained steadfast.

610
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,180
I mean, no doubt it was a constant bombardment.

611
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,580
No doubt it was a regular thing.

612
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,340
I mean, they're sending letters back and forth

613
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,139
and they're seeking to cause him to be afraid,

614
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,700
but I find that Nehemiah was a man

615
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,900
that remained steadfast.

616
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,420
For us as New Testament believers,

617
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,419
get our eyes on the Lord

618
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,300
and just continue to march forward

619
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,300
to do the work that God has called us to do.

620
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,500
We find that number one,

621
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,660
we need to learn to recognize the enemy,

622
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,619
to be able to identify the enemy.

623
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,900
And it's not always easy.

624
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,059
We need discernment

625
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,500
to try the spirits, as John says.

626
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,619
To know that we're engaged

627
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,260
in spiritual wickedness in high places,

628
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,779
the spiritual warfare that is taking place

629
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,100
in our society still even today.

630
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,260
It is raging.

631
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh, how we need the discernment of God

632
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,900
to be able to recognize, identify the enemy.

633
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,460
And then we need to learn how to resist the enemy.

634
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,419
It starts with submitting ourselves to God.

635
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,699
Being a man of prayer like Nehemiah.

636
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:05,020
Seeking the face of God.

637
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,540
Praying daily,

638
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,380
God, would You help me to have

639
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,260
the discernment as I go throughout my day

640
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
to be able to identify,

641
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,540
to recognize the enemy

642
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
and to see how the enemy would like

643
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:20,419
to hinder the work that You're doing in and through me.

644
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:23,660
We learn how to resist.

645
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,940
Number three this morning,

646
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,860
I believe that we need to learn how to rejoice

647
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,580
in the work of the Lord.

648
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,100
We notice verses 15 and 16.

649
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,860
I would say this as we would look at these verses.

650
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,380
Thinking about the truth of rejoicing,

651
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,740
I am so thankful for the truth

652
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,139
that greater is He that is in you

653
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,059
than he that is in the world.

654
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,699
We are on the winning side.

655
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,860
Have you read the book of Revelation?

656
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,020
We win! Amen?

657
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,580
You say, it's not looking so good.

658
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:56,460
Look to Jesus.

659
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,059
Don't worry about all this craziness.

660
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,380
They're trying to hinder you.

661
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,419
They're trying to stop you.

662
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:04,380
They're trying to hinder the work of God.

663
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Say, listen, we're on the winning side.

664
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,460
We win!

665
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,860
Jesus is the victor.

666
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,900
Amen?

667
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,260
Satan is already defeated.

668
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,100
He already knows his demise.

669
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,899
Revelation 20 and verse 10,

670
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:21,380
that old serpent,

671
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,179
he's cast in the lake of fire

672
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,299
and he will suffer and be tormented

673
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:30,899
day and night forever and ever.

674
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:31,700
Amen?

675
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,299
Curtis Hudson used to sing often.

676
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,380
I never had the privilege of meeting

677
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,980
or being in a meeting with Dr. Curtis Hudson.

678
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,540
In fact, he went home to be with the Lord

679
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,779
when I was just a little infant.

680
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,260
But I read many things about him

681
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,500
and often he would preach

682
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,100
and he would preach and he would sing.

683
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,940
I'm on the winning side.

684
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,019
Amen?

685
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:56,140
Rejoicing.

686
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,260
Notice the first four or five words here

687
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,339
of verse number 15.

688
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:03,540
So the wall was finished.

689
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,500
Isn't that good?

690
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700
Isn't that good?

691
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,019
The wall was finished.

692
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:13,420
In the twenty and fifth day

693
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,019
of the month Elu,

694
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,059
in fifty and two days.

695
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:22,459
Of course, those that would like to attack

696
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,260
the authenticity and the accuracy

697
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,140
of the Word of God

698
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,260
would say of this verse,

699
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,739
it's impossible that it could be done

700
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,140
in fifty-two days.

701
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,540
Listen, with God,

702
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,459
nothing shall be impossible.

703
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,540
Amen?

704
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
They had a lot of people.

705
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,019
If you go back and read through

706
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,459
the entirety of chapter number three

707
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,619
and you read of all of the people

708
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,619
that were working

709
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:43,860
and all the things that were going on

710
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,140
and you think about the size of the work,

711
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,739
you also understand that the Babylonians

712
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,580
did not utterly take down

713
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,700
every single piece of the wall.

714
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,019
And you understand, listen,

715
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,660
you put God into the equation,

716
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,500
it changes everything.

717
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,619
Amen?

718
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,059
And they finished the wall.

719
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,660
Not only did they finish the wall,

720
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,420
and I understand you don't really see

721
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,540
much rejoicing here,

722
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,299
but I think that there was rejoicing

723
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,820
on the part of the people of God

724
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,580
as they finished the wall.

725
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,179
But when we're rejoicing in the work of the Lord,

726
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,019
we know in verse number 16

727
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,420
that even the enemies had to recognize

728
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,019
that the work was wrought of God.

729
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:21,940
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 16.

730
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,540
And it came to pass

731
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,059
that when all our enemies heard thereof

732
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,100
and all the heathen that were about us

733
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,220
saw these things,

734
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,980
that they were much cast down in their own eyes,

735
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,059
for they perceived that this work

736
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:40,380
was wrought of our God.

737
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,380
Listen, when even the enemy recognizes

738
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,140
this is the work of God,

739
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,380
that's what I want to see.

740
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,220
Amen?

741
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,980
I want to just be a church

742
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,339
that's so submitted to God,

743
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,500
that's so just steadfast

744
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,540
in the work that God has called us to do,

745
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,860
that even the enemy would say,

746
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:05,059
that's the work of God.

747
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,899
Do you remember when Moses and Aaron

748
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,019
were dealing with Pharaoh?

749
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,339
The plagues?

750
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,220
The book of Exodus?

751
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,660
And I mean, the land of Egypt

752
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,019
was just tattered and torn.

753
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,739
It was just destroyed through those plagues.

754
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,299
In the beginning,

755
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
what is it that Pharaoh did?

756
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,380
Well, after they saw a miracle by Moses and Aaron,

757
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,100
he called his magicians.

758
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,140
Said, hey guys, you do the same thing they just did.

759
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,980
And they do.

760
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,220
I never could understand

761
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,220
when Pharaoh has his cronies bring more frogs.

762
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,059
Does that make any sense to you?

763
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,299
They had frogs everywhere.

764
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,500
In the bed chamber, in the oven,

765
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,339
and they were everywhere.

766
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,580
And he's gonna have his boys bring more frogs?

767
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,019
It don't even make sense.

768
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,500
But that's what he did.

769
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,500
But eventually,

770
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,100
you go through that passage of scripture,

771
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,940
those chapters in the book of Exodus,

772
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,140
and even the magicians come to Pharaoh and say,

773
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,500
this is the finger of God.

774
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,980
This is the finger of God.

775
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:17,980
These enemies.

776
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,700
Do you think the enemies wanted to recognize

777
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,860
that God did this?

778
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,220
No, but there was no other explanation.

779
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,380
They came to this place

780
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,940
where they're cast down in their own eyes.

781
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,779
They're defeated.

782
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:33,899
We did everything we could do.

783
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:36,859
I mean, it was a full court press.

784
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,979
We pulled out all the stops, all the tricks.

785
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,140
We hired people and we tried to deceive

786
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
and we did everything.

787
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,460
And the work was finished.

788
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,419
The work was finished.

789
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:48,539
Let me share with you this morning

790
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,739
a few promises from the Word of God

791
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,140
for us as the people of God.

792
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,500
Go to the book of Matthew, if you will.

793
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,059
In Matthew chapter number 16.

794
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:57,780
You believe the Bible this morning?

795
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,260
Every word, amen?

796
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,820
Every word of God is pure.

797
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,900
So thankful for the Word of God.

798
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:09,099
We sing, we didn't sing it this morning,

799
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,900
but we sing standing on the promises, amen?

800
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,419
Peter says they're exceeding great and precious promises.

801
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,859
Paul says that we can be confident

802
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,179
in the promises of God.

803
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:22,700
In Him, they're yay, amen?

804
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,419
Listen, what God says, He will do.

805
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:26,859
Notice Matthew 16.

806
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,739
It's right in the midst of the portion

807
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,380
in which Jesus asked the disciples,

808
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,140
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

809
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:38,419
Then He says, but whom say ye that I am?

810
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,380
See, because the answer that they say

811
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,500
that you're John the Baptist,

812
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,260
you're one of the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah, someone else,

813
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,340
that wasn't the right answer.

814
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,020
So Jesus says, whom say ye that I am?

815
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,099
And Peter stands up in boldness and declares,

816
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,539
thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

817
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:54,380
He's the Messiah.

818
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,220
He's the promised one.

819
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,419
He's God in flesh.

820
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,979
And we find that Jesus then gives a promise

821
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,900
in verse number 18.

822
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,260
I say also unto you,

823
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,059
that thou shalt not be deceived by any man,

824
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,500
but by the Son of Man,

825
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,659
and by the Son of Man,

826
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:08,659
and by the Son of Man,

827
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:09,500
and by the Son of Man,

828
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:18,380
to thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates

829
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,140
of hell shall not prevail against it."

830
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,739
Now we know that verse.

831
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:31,579
I want you to turn there and look at it because I want it to impact us today.

832
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,700
Jesus said, I will build my church.

833
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,260
It's not our church, it's His church.

834
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,239
And He said, I will build my church.

835
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,959
And He said, furthermore, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

836
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,680
Does that mean they're not even going to try?

837
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,759
They've been trying from the beginning.

838
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:52,479
In Acts chapter number 3 and 4, you see the persecution intensify.

839
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:57,080
In chapter number 8, it goes to a whole other level.

840
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:04,759
And you find the promise though of God Almighty that the gates of hell shall not prevail against

841
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:05,759
it.

842
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:06,959
I'm so thankful for that.

843
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:11,759
Listen, there's going to be a day when God's done with the church.

844
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:16,480
And that's when we get to go to be with Him, amen?

845
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,760
The church is the organism that God is using during this particular time of history.

846
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,440
And He's using the church and He says, I'm going to build it and the gates of hell shall

847
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,680
not prevail against it.

848
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,440
Look here at the book of Romans in chapter number 8.

849
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,739
I just want to share a few promises with you to encourage you this morning.

850
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,860
As we think about the enemy, even as Nehemiah would face an enemy, and even still today

851
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,779
as we face an enemy that would seek to, yes, their ultimate desire is to destroy the work,

852
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:49,059
but they want to hinder the work.

853
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,379
They want to do anything they can to hinder the work of God.

854
00:41:54,379 --> 00:42:01,180
Romans chapter number 8 and verse number 31, what shall we then say to these things?

855
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,940
If God be for us, who can be against us?

856
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,980
I want to be on God's side, amen?

857
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,260
If God be for us, who can be against us?

858
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:21,539
Notice what he says in verse number 37, nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors

859
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,539
through Him that loved us.

860
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,539
More than conquerors.

861
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,259
I've already said we're on the winning side.

862
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:33,259
What a joy, what a blessing to be victorious, to be conquerors.

863
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:40,020
Listen, for too long now the church has acted as if we have no power.

864
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,419
The church has laid down and allowed the enemy to just keep on marching.

865
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:49,059
The church has said we shouldn't get involved with these things, we shouldn't talk about

866
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,259
these things, we're going to keep it to ourselves.

867
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:56,860
No, no, we're to go forth and make a difference, amen?

868
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,179
We're on the winning side.

869
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:03,139
We go in the power of the Lord God Almighty.

870
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:06,940
And if God be for us, who can be against us?

871
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,059
You say, well I have a whole list of people that are against us.

872
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:13,419
Yeah, I do too.

873
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:18,500
But with God, we're a majority, amen?

874
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,539
Look at 1 Corinthians 15.

875
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:28,619
We mentioned that one of the ways in which Nehemiah resisted the enemy was that he remained

876
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,139
steadfast.

877
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:36,820
We find in 1 Corinthians 15 in verse number 58.

878
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,899
Another familiar verse of Scripture.

879
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:44,979
Verse 57 says, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

880
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:45,979
Christ.

881
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:53,740
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of

882
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,740
the Lord.

883
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Why?

884
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Why?

885
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,460
For as much as ye know.

886
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,460
Every word of God is for you.

887
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,300
He didn't say for as much as you think, for as much as we hope, for as much as you know

888
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,220
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

889
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:21,580
Listen, when we go in the power of God Almighty and we're going forth into the battlefield

890
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26,500
and we're giving the truth of the Word of God and we're battling over the souls of men,

891
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,859
you can understand that our work is not in vain in the Lord.

892
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:32,500
God is working.

893
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,619
God uses His Word.

894
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,779
He promises to do so.

895
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:39,739
You say, well I just don't see how God is working.

896
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:42,019
You just remain steadfast.

897
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:50,040
See, sometimes what we know has to supersede what we think.

898
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,619
We look at the surface and we say, I think this isn't working.

899
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,019
I think I'm not making any progress.

900
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:00,299
I think it's just, no, no, we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

901
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:03,619
I think about what Paul said in Romans chapter number 8.

902
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,019
You don't need to turn there, but when we talk about all things work together for good

903
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:12,980
to them that love God, it starts out with, and we know, because sometimes when we're

904
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,459
in the midst of something, we might sit there and say, how is this going to work for good?

905
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:22,940
What we know has to supersede what we think.

906
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:29,100
And he says here that we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

907
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:41,739
Philippians chapter number 1, Paul is writing to this church, he's in prison.

908
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,619
This church had communicated with him many times.

909
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:52,140
They gave, they were a precious group of people to Paul.

910
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,619
Paul says they're a precious group of people to him, prayed for them.

911
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:01,179
I mean, the beginning of chapter number 1 of the book of Philippians is just powerful

912
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:06,380
to see the relationship that they had, the love.

913
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,940
And notice what Paul says to these believers in Philippians 1 and verse number 6, being

914
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,940
confident.

915
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,459
Don't you like that word?

916
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,019
That's a good word.

917
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:27,220
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform

918
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,380
it until the day of Jesus Christ, being confident.

919
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:40,339
Listen, this morning, as we look at Nehemiah chapter number 6, and it happened 2,500 years

920
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:50,220
ago, just about, and you think about the events and the situation that Nehemiah dealt with,

921
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,299
do you see that things have changed somewhat, but the basics of the spiritual warfare that

922
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,380
we deal with, it remains the same, 2,500 years.

923
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:10,100
Oh, we have different technology now, thankfully we have some modern conveniences now, right?

924
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:17,019
But the enemy, still working today in the same way that he was 2,500 years ago, and

925
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:23,579
he wants to deceive you, and he wants to deceive me, and one thing that he uses is fear, fear.

926
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:28,700
When we look at these promises of God that we've looked at in the New Testament, and

927
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:39,619
we are mindful that over and over that God says to his people, fear not, be not afraid.

928
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:46,179
Over and over and over we read those words in this precious book.

929
00:47:46,179 --> 00:48:00,899
I'm mindful of the truth of Hebrews 13, in verses 5 and 6, the Bible says in Hebrews

930
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:07,339
13 verse 5, let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things

931
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:15,019
as you have, completely different message in that portion of verse number 5, but notice

932
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:19,619
what he says at the end of verse number 5, for he hath said, I will never leave thee

933
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,820
nor forsake thee, isn't that precious?

934
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:32,299
But you know what the result of that understanding is, is verse number 6, so that we may boldly

935
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:44,299
say the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

936
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,960
Why is it that you do not have any fear?

937
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,179
Because the Lord is my helper, the Lord is my helper, and he said I'll never leave thee

938
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,940
nor forsake thee.

939
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,580
Remember Psalm 121, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help?

940
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,979
My help cometh from the Lord, notice this, which made heaven and earth.

941
00:49:03,979 --> 00:49:05,520
Now how did he make it?

942
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,179
He spoke and it was so, amen?

943
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:13,380
The wonder of creation, God said and it was so.

944
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:24,340
The power of creation, and he's my helper, he's your helper, he's Nehemiah's helper.

945
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,219
How could Nehemiah continue with all that was going on?

946
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:32,419
I mean day after day after day, the work being opposed and all of the adversity, he's a man

947
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:33,419
of prayer.

948
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:36,659
He learned how to recognize the enemy.

949
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:41,460
He learned how to resist the enemy, and I believe that as we look at the completion

950
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,820
of the wall, we rejoice in the work of God.

951
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:54,099
This morning I pray that God would help us to recognize the enemy and to resist the enemy

952
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:58,059
and to keep on keeping on.

953
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:04,820
One day it's all going to be over, whether it's by death or by rapture, it's going to

954
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,500
be over.

955
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,460
But until then, oh that God would help us.

956
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,180
to just press on and say, look, I'm not looking for some cave to run to and hide in.

957
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,180
I'm not.

958
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:23,460
People want to move to Idaho and wherever else they want to move to, we're 16 miles

959
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
from the White House.

960
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:30,260
Oh, man, we're in the thick of it, amen?

961
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,580
Come on.

962
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:37,700
They're legislating all kinds of wickedness, but we are on the winning side.

963
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,700
And we say, we want to, we want to recognize the enemy.

964
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,420
Sometimes it's real easy.

965
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:50,460
Other times it takes great levels of discernment that only God can give us, and oh, that we

966
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,660
would resist and see God work and do what only He can do, amen?

967
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,380
I'm glad Nehemiah didn't give up.

968
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,140
Can you imagine?

969
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,100
Well, it's just too hard.

970
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,140
We just kind of, boys go home, close down shop, we're not going to continue this.

971
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,980
They don't want us to do it.

972
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
No.

973
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
They were persistent.

974
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,380
They just kept on, kept on, keeping on.

975
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,380
Let's pray.

976
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,060
Father, we love You.

977
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,100
Thank You for loving us.

978
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:24,660
Thank You for this passage, and though the events occurred over 2,000 years ago, we see

979
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,900
such similarities of what we deal with today.

980
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:38,060
Oh, how we need perception, discernment, to be able to recognize and identify the enemy.

981
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,620
We understand the truth that You have given to us in Your Word with regard to resisting

982
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:48,540
the enemy, and I trust that You would help us to follow the pattern, the discipline of

983
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,080
Nehemiah that we see in Nehemiah chapter 6.

984
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,920
Help us this morning to leave this place encouraged because of the promises that You've

985
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,040
given us in Your Word.

986
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,880
We're thankful for the good work that You have started.

987
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,320
We know that You will complete it.

988
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,880
We know that You said that You would build Your church, and the gates of hell shall not

989
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,960
prevail against it.

990
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,080
Lord, I pray You'd help us to be a people that are fully surrendered to You, a people

991
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:25,040
that are yielded, that would allow You to do what only You can do, that even the enemy

992
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,000
would have to look at it and say, the Lord did that.

993
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,160
Oh, God, we pray that You'd work in that way.

994
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,680
Use this time of invitation as only You can to convict and to convince and to change we,

995
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
Your people.

996
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:50,960
That we might go out of here with a revived focus and a resolve to serve You faithfully.

997
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,320
It's in Christ's name we pray.

998
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,080
Would you stand with me?

999
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,280
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1000
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,200
Jared's going to play quietly on the piano, and as he is playing, the altar is open.

1001
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,000
Come to this old-fashioned altar, make your seat an altar.

1002
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,240
Would you submit to God, surrender to God?

1003
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,040
Let God use you.

1004
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,840
Ask Him to help you to have that ability, that discernment to recognize and identify

1005
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,960
the enemy.

1006
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,680
As Jared plays, the altar is open.
