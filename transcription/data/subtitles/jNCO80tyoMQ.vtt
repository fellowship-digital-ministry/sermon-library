WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
some folks visiting with us this morning.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.940
Patricia's joining us again,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.780
and Rob is here with us as well,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.779
and certainly thankful for folks that are visiting.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.920
Good to see the Salgados this morning,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.779
and looking forward to seeing Emery.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.579
I'm sure he's getting nice and big,

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.500
and good to see you folks this morning.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.100
Nehemiah chapter number six,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.940
and we'll be looking at this portion of scripture.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.620
Let me just give you a little bit of background

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.700
before we get into the passage this morning.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.620
Of course, as you know,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.700
Judah had been taken captive by the Babylonians,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
and after that captivity,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.479
we understand that they spent 70 years in exile

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.360
before Cyrus came to the throne,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.220
and Cyrus made a decree that the Jewish people

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.139
could return to the land of their homeland,

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:44.119
to the city of Jerusalem particularly,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.439
and we find that it's in the book of Ezra

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.520
that God records for us and provides for us

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.759
the details regarding the return,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:54.599
and obviously the building of the temple

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:55.720
is found in the book of Ezra,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.439
and you can read and study and see all that God does,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.900
revival, and so on and so forth,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.540
and we find that as we come to the book of Nehemiah,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.139
that it's in that same time frame,

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:09.180
obviously several years after Ezra and that group,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.860
that original group had returned to Jerusalem,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.220
and many years later, we find that Nehemiah

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.260
in chapter number one is found in Shushan,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.779
and he's serving the king Artaxerxes,

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.500
and we find that he's in that place,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.699
and he's the cupbearer for Artaxerxes,

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:26.819
and chapter number one tells us

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:30.000
that he has some correspondence with Hanani,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.839
and the specifics of that correspondence

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.519
dealt with the situation in Jerusalem.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.160
He asked specifically, how are things in Jerusalem?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.800
Give me a report as to what's going on there,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.519
and we find that Hanani delivers to Nehemiah this report

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.760
with regard to the great affliction and the reproach.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.839
He tells him that the wall of Jerusalem

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:56.480
also is broken down,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.400
and the gates thereof are burned with fire,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.839
and we find that Nehemiah, as he received that report

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:04.800
after that correspondence with Hanani,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.240
we find that he was very burdened

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.960
for the situation in Jerusalem.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.559
We find that he immediately went to God in prayer,

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.199
and he began to seek the face of God,

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.600
and we find that chapter number two tells us

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440
that he was in the presence of Artaxerxes,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.479
and prior to this particular event,

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.880
he had not been sad in the presence of Artaxerxes,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.679
but Artaxerxes could see in his countenance

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.559
that he was sad, and he said, what is it?

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.080
This is nothing more than sorrow of heart,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.199
and we find that Nehemiah reveals to the king

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.399
that which he had heard and understood,

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.360
and permission is granted for Nehemiah to return.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.600
As you read the rest of chapter number two,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.979
you find that Nehemiah gets back to the city,

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.059
and he, on his own, upon arrival,

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.779
he goes and he views the city,

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.779
and he's taking everything in,

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.139
and he's seeing firsthand exactly what Hanani

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.300
had described to him in that correspondence

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.539
in chapter number one,

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.740
and we find that Nehemiah then issues a challenge

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.220
to the people of God, those that were there,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.580
and he tells them, let's rise up and build.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.779
The good hand of the Lord is upon me.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.779
And he understood there was a work to be done,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.539
and we find that immediately upon the challenge

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.020
being issued in Nehemiah chapter number two,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.020
the opposition also is there.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.059
I mean, immediately upon Nehemiah saying,

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.259
let us rise up and build,

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.020
the Bible tells us that Sanballat and Tobiah

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.199
were there ready to oppose the work of God.

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.979
Chapter three, four, and five provide us for a record

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.619
not only of those that were there

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.619
in chapter number three extensively,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.740
but chapters four and five reveal to us

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.699
the work that is being carried on

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.100
and the opposition that they're facing.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.820
When we come to chapter number six specifically,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.259
we find that I believe that the enemy begins

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.860
to really up their game, so to speak.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.179
And we find that as we look at chapter number six

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.979
and dive into this passage this morning,

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.860
I'm trusting that God will help to equip

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.019
and strengthen us as the people of God,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.059
even as the enemy would seek to derail us.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.299
We find that it's here in chapter number six

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:25.579
in verse number one.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:27.179
It says, now it came to pass

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.660
when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.059
and the rest of our enemies heard

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.019
that I had builded the wall

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:36.779
and that there was no breach left therein,

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.739
and though it says there are parentheses

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:39.660
at the end of verse number one,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.059
though at that time I had not set up

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:42.179
the doors upon the gates,

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:44.899
notice verse two, that Sanballat and Geshem

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.700
sent unto me saying,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.579
come, let us meet together in some one of the villages

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.700
in the plain of Ono.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.019
But they thought to do me mischief.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.179
If you've already looked at the back

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:00.059
of the bulletin this morning,

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.100
the title is found here in verse number two

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.980
for our message this morning.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.299
They thought to do me mischief.

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:13.940
That word mischief is often translated as evil.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.980
Not that mischief is a wrong translation of the word,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.980
but it's synonymous,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.700
and we understand that it's translated various ways,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.420
but the mischief that was intended to be done

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.700
against Nehemiah and those that were doing the work,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.100
they had evil intentions against the man of God

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.660
and the work of God.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.179
I believe that as we look here

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.540
at this passage of Scripture,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.980
there's some things that we need to learn

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.540
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.579
we need to learn to recognize the enemy.

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:43.660
We need to learn to recognize the enemy.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.739
Now understand that by this time,

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:47.339
I mean, Nehemiah had been working

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.579
and Nehemiah had been enduring some opposition,

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:51.299
adversity, and hardship,

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:53.059
and we can read of that in chapters,

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:54.579
really the end of chapter two,

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:55.779
three, four, and five,

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.579
really four and five capture a lot of it, most of it.

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:00.859
And so we find that by this time,

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.059
Nehemiah had been very familiar

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.739
with who his enemies were.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.179
In verse number one, in fact,

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.859
the Bible says that it came to pass

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:11.220
when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.059
notice what he says,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.779
and the rest of our enemies.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.339
And so Nehemiah at this particular time of his ministry,

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.380
he was able to easily identify who his enemies were.

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:24.899
But I want you to understand

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.839
that though the opposition to the work of God

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.700
began immediately,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.059
I find that as I read Nehemiah chapter number six,

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.420
that we discover that the enemy

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.899
is increasing their deception.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.179
See, Sanballat and Tobiah were constantly

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:44.220
in chapters four and five coming and saying things,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.299
let us join with you,

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:48.339
and if a fox goes up on it, it's gonna crumble,

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:49.540
and I mean, all of the ridicule

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.339
and all of the things that they said.

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:52.899
But now in chapter number six,

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:57.779
the level of deception increases exponentially.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.420
And it's important as we study

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.459
through chapter number six this morning

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:04.079
that we find that Nehemiah was able

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:07.019
to consistently recognize the enemy.

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:08.140
Can I tell you this morning

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:09.660
that the enemy doesn't always show up

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.179
by saying, I'm your enemy.

00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:14.660
In fact, it's very rare

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.700
that an enemy would show up that way, right?

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.920
And so we find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.839
that the deception is increasing.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.540
Remember what the word of God says

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.059
in the book of Ephesians in chapter number six,

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.380
and we studied this book a few years ago in its entirety,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.220
but we find in Ephesians chapter number six

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.859
in verse number 10,

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:36.739
Paul says this to the believers in Ephesus,

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.140
finally, my brethren,

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.260
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.420
Put on the whole armor of God

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.420
that you may be able to stand

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.700
against the wiles of the devil.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.980
That word wiles, it carries with it

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.980
the idea of deceit, deception, craftiness, tricky.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.299
Remember that it says of the serpent

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:01.839
in Genesis chapter number three,

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.779
that he was more subtle than any beast of the field.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.420
We find that it's in verse number 12

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.260
of the same passage in Ephesians six

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.500
that Paul says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.619
but against principalities, against powers,

00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:17.980
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.600
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:27.140
I believe that as we look here in Nehemiah chapter number six

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.859
it reminds me as we think about the deception increasing

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.580
and we think about the attacks

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.280
in which Nehemiah would deal with

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.780
the opposition to the work,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.239
it reminds me of what we read back in the book of Numbers

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:40.960
under the counsel of Balaam.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.039
Remember that Balaam could not curse the people of God.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.960
Though Balak wanted him to,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.820
we find that it was through the counsel of Balaam

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.960
that he encouraged the people of God to corrupt themselves.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.539
You can read that in Numbers 31 and verse number 16.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:00.840
We also find that it's very similar to what you read of

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.280
in the book of Joshua in the ninth chapter

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.159
with the deception of the Gibeonites.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:09.659
And we find that our enemy is going to consistently

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.599
and regularly increase the deception

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:14.760
because he's our enemy.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:19.520
Understand as we look at this point this morning

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.679
that we need to learn to recognize the enemy,

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:24.880
we need to understand the objective of the enemy.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.159
I mean, ultimately their objective is to destroy the work.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:31.119
And that's what they'd like to do.

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:35.400
But I believe that the enemy, though he understands,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.440
and we'll look at some promises at the end of the message

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.880
this morning, the work of God will march on.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.099
I believe that where he finds great satisfaction

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:48.640
is in hindering the work of God.

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:52.299
Hindering the work of God.

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:54.559
That's exactly what the enemy had been trying to do

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.080
in chapters four and five.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.039
And now in chapter number six,

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.119
we find that the enemy recognizes

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.539
that the building is continuing to go on.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.159
I mean, the wall is near completion.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.539
It says that the doors had not yet been set up upon the gates,

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:10.719
but we find that they're nearing completion.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:13.799
And so the enemy is going to elevate and increase

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.119
the level of deception.

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:18.279
And they're going to come and try to hinder the work.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.599
So what do they do?

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.279
We understand what their objective is,

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:24.679
but look at what the method is that's employed in Nehemiah

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:25.759
chapter number 6.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.719
First, we find in verses 2 through 4

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:32.279
that there is a request for a meeting in one of the villages.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:34.679
The Bible says in verse number 2,

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:37.559
come let us meet together in some one of the villages

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.559
in the plain of Ono.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:44.159
Notice what Nehemiah says, but they thought to do me mischief.

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.519
And so they desired to have this meeting.

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:51.039
No doubt, I believe that if this meeting would have taken place,

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:54.039
they would have sought to intimidate Nehemiah

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.479
from continuing with the work.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:59.239
I believe that really another plan of these individuals

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:02.119
was to get Nehemiah distracted from the work,

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.959
remove him from the work he was doing.

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:05.799
Notice what he says in verse number 3,

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.639
and I sent messengers unto them saying,

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:12.439
I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down.

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:18.919
Why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you?

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:20.959
See, the enemy wants the work to cease.

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:22.479
He wants to hinder the work.

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:24.199
And so let's remove Nehemiah.

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:26.839
And Nehemiah was used by God in an amazing way

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:29.919
to lead these people that are rebuilding the walls.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.119
And so the enemy is coming and trying

00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:35.959
to get the leader to be removed and to go to this meeting

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:37.599
that they set up in this plain.

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:41.199
Notice what the Bible says that after Nehemiah sent messengers

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:42.839
unto them, that in verse number 4,

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.479
the Bible says, yet they sent unto me

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:47.639
four times after this sort.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.759
And I answered them after the same matter.

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:54.039
The enemy is persistent.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:56.519
The enemy is persistent.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:59.799
We often can use the word that he's relentless.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:02.279
We find the enemy in his persistence.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:05.439
We find it on four times this first option

00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:08.039
of having Nehemiah leave Jerusalem

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:10.319
and go into one of these villages, this place

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:13.159
in the plain of Ono, so that they could have this meeting

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:15.919
and seek to cause the work of God

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:18.159
to cease, to hinder the work of God,

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.720
to intimidate the man of God.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.599
But it did not work.

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:25.199
So we notice method number 2 in our passage of Scripture

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:26.599
in verses 5 through 9.

00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:29.679
We find that they send an open letter.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.919
An open letter.

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.639
You know, really what they're doing here

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:35.360
is they're lying about the motive of Nehemiah.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.799
They're slandering the name of Nehemiah.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.599
They send an open letter so that it can be read

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:43.919
by more than just Nehemiah.

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:47.799
In the previous section, the first approach

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:49.879
in seeking to have him meet, the Bible

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.559
says that verse 2, that Sanballat and Geshem

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:54.399
sent unto Me.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.319
So they go directly to Nehemiah.

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:58.119
They want a meeting with you over here.

00:12:58.119 --> 00:13:00.599
Now we find in verse number 5 that it says,

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:03.759
then sent Sanballat his servant unto Me

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:08.399
in like manner the fifth time with an open letter

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:11.879
in his hand, desiring that others

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:14.360
within the city of Jerusalem would read this

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.159
and they would have the opportunity

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:18.440
to influence other people.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.759
And look at what the letter says.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.599
Verse 6, wherein was written,

00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:26.959
it is reported among the heathen,

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:30.919
and Gashemus saith it, that thou and the Jews

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:35.080
think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.519
notice this, that thou mayest be their king,

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.039
according to these words.

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:43.479
So what are they saying?

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:46.360
Nehemiah, you want to be the king.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.720
You have selfish motives.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.239
You're coming in there and you want to be the king.

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:52.599
You want to be the leader.

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.559
And you want to be the king in verse number 7.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:58.519
And thou hast also appointed prophets

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:01.399
to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:03.599
there is a king in Judah.

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:08.080
And so this is the attempt, the way in which the enemy is

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.399
going to try to deal with this now in this open letter

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:14.639
and seeking to influence others to rebel against Nehemiah

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:20.000
and seeking to undermine the character of this man.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.679
There is a king in Judah, verse 7,

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.799
and now shall it be reported to the king according

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:24.359
to these words.

00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:26.679
Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together.

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.679
So here's what they do.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:29.639
They say, we know this is what you want to do.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:31.839
And they're trying to influence, but not only

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:34.399
in influencing the others, but they're now saying,

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.119
we're going to go to the king, Artaxerxes.

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:38.639
And we're going to tell him that you

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.919
are going to rebel against him and you want to be the king.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.880
Now, Nehemiah had a good relationship with Artaxerxes.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.720
He was his cupbearer.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.639
In chapter number 2, you see the interaction.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:53.239
And we find that the enemy is seeking,

00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:55.839
through various levels of deception,

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:56.720
as they would elevate.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.880
It's not now just Sanballat and Tobiah that are coming

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.119
and trying to attack Nehemiah.

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:06.279
They give these invitations, and now they send this open letter.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.399
Let's get some other people riled up against them.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:11.600
Let's have the influence of the people

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.359
so that he would not be able to continue the work.

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:18.440
We find that not only that, the third level of deception

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.239
that we find is recorded for us in verses 10 through 14.

00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:22.600
Look at what happens now.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.239
Again, the enemy continues to elevate

00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:26.559
the level of deception.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.720
It says afterward, in verse number 10,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.079
I came unto the house of Shemaiah, the son of Deliah,

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:35.519
the son of Mehedabiel, who was shut up.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:42.000
And he said, let us meet together in the house of God,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.839
within the temple.

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.519
And let us shut the doors of the temple.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.799
Why?

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:50.959
For they will come to slay thee.

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:56.760
Yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.239
So now this fellow says to Nehemiah,

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:02.160
Nehemiah, they're going to come kill you.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.799
The only place that you can find refuge is in the temple.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.720
Now that would've been a problem for Nehemiah

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.440
to go into the temple.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.000
It seems very obvious through the passage of scripture

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.919
that the recommendation was to go into the holy place.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:19.479
He wasn't permitted to go into the holy of holies.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:24.359
And it was as if the enemy now, notice what the Bible says,

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.239
that Nehemiah replies and says, look at verse number 11.

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:30.119
Should such a man as I flee, and who

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:32.479
is there that being as I am, would go into the temple

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:33.239
to save his life?

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:35.119
I will not go in.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:38.679
And lo, notice this word, circle it, underline it,

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:46.600
I perceived, I perceived that God had not sent him,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.519
but that he pronounced this prophecy against me,

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:53.760
notice this, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.160
What level of deception.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.079
The influence that they had these enemies,

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:03.519
the way in which, and we'll notice

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.679
at the end of the passage, they infiltrate.

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:08.279
And they now get this man, according

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.919
to what we see in verse number 10,

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:15.639
to come and to say to Nehemiah that he, this is Shemiah,

00:17:15.639 --> 00:17:18.160
as we notice in verse number 10, Shemiah says, hey listen,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.239
they're going to come and kill you,

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:21.320
and so you need to go over here and hide yourself,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.119
protect yourself.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.639
It's where you'd find refuge.

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:26.720
And we find that really their intent,

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.660
as Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.380
notice what it says in verse number 13,

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.779
therefore was he hired that I should be afraid and do so.

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:35.299
Do what?

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:38.500
Go into that place that he was not permitted to go into

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:47.179
and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:50.059
that they might reproach me.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.979
Oh, the enemy is, he's crafting.

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:56.059
Hey listen, Nehemiah, they're going to kill you.

00:17:56.059 --> 00:17:56.979
They're going to come at night and they're

00:17:56.979 --> 00:17:57.419
going to kill you.

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:58.859
The only place you can find refuge

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:01.820
is in the place where you're not permitted to go.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.859
But if you go in that place, then you'll have refuge.

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:06.619
You'll have safety.

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:10.100
But in going to that place, they then

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.100
are going to say, oh, you went to where

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.220
you weren't supposed to go.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.579
You sinned.

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:16.779
Now they can bring up an evil report

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:20.519
and they can bring reproach against Nehemiah.

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:23.540
It's crazy, but that's how the enemy works.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.579
We see it right here in Nehemiah chapter number 6.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:30.260
Notice how they, at the end of the passage in verses 17

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.739
through 19, notice their approach of infiltration,

00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:34.380
as I have referred to it as.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.460
We find that verse 17 says, moreover, in those days,

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.900
the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.339
The nobles of Judah.

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:46.779
They're sending letters to Tobiah.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:47.419
Who's Tobiah?

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.900
He's the enemy.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.260
Notice what it says.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.979
And the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:55.779
So these fellows are corresponding one

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:58.059
with another.

00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:04.859
Verse 18, for there were many in Judah, many, sworn unto him.

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:05.460
Why?

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.460
Because he was the son-in-law of Shekeniah, the son of Arah.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.099
And his son, Johanan, had taken the daughter of Meshulam,

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:17.299
the son of Berechiah.

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:21.580
So through these relationships, through his wife

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.779
and his daughter-in-law, he's now infiltrated.

00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:27.940
And he has the ear of the nobles of Judah.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.539
And they're corresponding one with the other.

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.020
It tells us in verse number 19, also,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.099
they reported his good deeds before me

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:39.059
and uttered my words to him.

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:42.940
And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.339
The enemy is tricky.

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:48.460
He's deceitful.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.299
And he has no morals.

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:54.979
He's relentless, and he's ruthless.

00:19:54.979 --> 00:19:59.859
And he will do whatever is necessary to hinder

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:01.900
the work of God.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:11.140
of God. Whatever. Because He's evil. And this enemy, these enemies, we see that

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.940
when they were not able to be successful in the end of chapter number two, the

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.540
first approach was, hey, let us join you. Verses chapters four and five, all of the

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.380
ways in which they sought to cause the work of God to hinder, and now in chapter

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:34.020
six we see the level of deception rise exponentially. They hire a man that's

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.740
supposed to be a priest. They infiltrate the ranks of the nobles of Judah

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.620
through relationship so that they can have influence. Wow. And I want you to pay

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:53.600
particular attention to how the enemy would use fear. It's very interesting in

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.560
this passage of Scripture how the enemy will use fear. Notice in verse number

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.560
nine. Verse eight, I didn't read verses eight and nine, we'll get to that in just a

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.880
moment, but it says in verse eight, Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.360
things done as thou sayest, but thou faintest them out of thine own heart. For

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.800
they all, notice what it says, made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.560
weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.520
hands. So the first reference to fear or being afraid is in verse number nine,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:32.240
They all made us afraid. Notice verse number 13, Therefore was he hired that I

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:40.160
should be afraid and do so. So we find in verse number nine this thing of fear, we

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.000
find in verse number 13 this thing of fear, and at the end of verse number 18,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.200
19, excuse me, it says, Also that reported his good deeds before me and uttered my

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:55.720
words to him, and Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. You know why the enemy

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.640
uses fear? Because the enemy uses fear, and I believe that when he can make the

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:09.520
people of God afraid, he can cause us to do things that otherwise we would not do.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.600
Don't keep doing this work because here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.960
kill you, we're gonna imprison you, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, and

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.760
I'm afraid, right? They said in verse number 13, He was hired to tell me that

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.480
they were gonna come and kill me so that I would be afraid and do so, go into the

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.400
place where I was not permitted to go. And so the enemy is gonna use fear, the

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.740
enemy continues to use fear, and the enemy uses fear, and I believe that as he

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.280
would make people afraid, that he can be successful, at least in his

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:44.980
objective, to hinder the work of God. To hinder the work of God. I'm afraid to do

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.520
this, I'm afraid to do that, I'm afraid to go here, I'm afraid to go there. And the

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.320
work of God is hindered because of fear. And here in Nehemiah chapter number six,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.540
on three occasions we find that the enemy specifically, the four methods are

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.000
outlined, I would submit to you that even though the Bible doesn't say in the

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.560
first four verses of chapter number six that they were trying to make him afraid

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.080
in that meeting as well. I mean, when he says that they thought to do mischief to

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.880
me, or they thought to do to me mischief, obviously they were trying to make him

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:22.160
afraid. So the enemy wants to cause the people of God to be fearful so that the

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.720
work of God would be hindered, so the work of God would cease from going

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.040
forward. And so this morning, I believe that as we look at Nehemiah chapter

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.680
number six, the first reality, the first thing that we need to learn is we need

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.520
to learn how to recognize the enemy. And I submit to you this morning that it's

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.240
not always easy to recognize the enemy. Look at the methods that are used in

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.960
this portion of Scripture, the extent in which the enemy would go to deceive you,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:57.600
to deceive me. We find that we need to learn to recognize the enemy. Number two,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.600
we need to learn to resist the enemy. We need to learn to resist the enemy. Notice,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.880
you can hold your place here Nehemiah, but I want you to be mindful of what

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:12.360
James says in James 4 and verse number 7. In James 4 and verse number 7, the

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.120
Bible says this, submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil, and he

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.560
will flee from you. That's a great promise of God's Word, is it not? Listen,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.320
before you resist the enemy, you need to submit to God. That's the formula. Submit

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.880
to God, submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.360
from you. As we submit ourselves to God and we're filled with the power of the

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.800
Holy Spirit of God, then we have the ability to be able to resist the enemy,

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.120
and we have the promise that the enemy is going to flee. See, the devil don't

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:53.200
want to mess with the Lord. He wants to mess with you, in your flesh, because he

00:24:53.200 --> 00:25:00.600
can be successful. Amen? I want you to notice on the four methods that were

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.080
employed in Nehemiah chapter number 6, I want you to notice how Nehemiah

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.200
responds to each of those situations, but before we look at that specifically in

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.240
Nehemiah chapter number 6, I want you to note that Nehemiah was a man of prayer.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.720
Nehemiah is a man of prayer, and I believe that that's such a key for us to

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.320
see how that he had the level of perception and discernment to be able to

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:29.160
recognize the enemy in chapter number 6, because he was a man of prayer. He's

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.560
submitting to God. He's a man of prayer. Notice in Nehemiah chapter number 1, we

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.120
don't have time to read the entirety of it, but in verse number 4 is when you

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.440
begin to see where Nehemiah prays. It goes all the way through the end of

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.180
chapter number 1, there in verse number 11, but notice what it says in Nehemiah 1

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.700
in verse 4, and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:54.820
wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:00.540
Listen, I'm glad that he wept and I'm glad that he mourned, but had he not

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.340
fasted and prayed, we may not see the same results that we see here in Nehemiah.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.220
We find that, yes, we can weep for our nation, we can mourn for the report that

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:17.900
we hear, but we better seek the face of God. We need a revival of prayer. We find,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.100
again, I don't have time to read the entirety of the next verses, read it

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.500
later, but through the end of verse number 11, we find that Nehemiah is

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.460
praying, and what a great prayer it is. A prayer of intercession, a prayer of

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:36.220
confession, the sins of the people. I mean, he's serious in his prayer. We find

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:41.540
that in Nehemiah chapter number 2, after Artaxerxes sees that he has nothing

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.420
more but sorrow of heart, and he says to him, you know, what do you want? And look

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.940
at verse number 4, then the king said unto me, for what dost thou make request?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.580
And then notice the last part of verse number 4, so I prayed to the God of

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:02.420
heaven, and I said unto the king, to start verse number 5, can I tell you that it's

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:08.220
not always the length of your prayer? Notice the scene in Nehemiah chapter

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.020
number 2. Artaxerxes says, hey, I notice your countenance. This is nothing more

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.740
than sorrow of heart. What is it that you request? And before he answered the king,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:23.660
it says that he prayed to God. What a great truth. Nehemiah's a man of prayer.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.540
Not only there, notice in chapter number 4. Chapter number 3 deals with the work

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.140
being assigned and all of the people that were there, and chapter number 4,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.900
again, the work being attacked and all that's going on. Notice in verse number

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.140
8 of Nehemiah 4, the Bible says, and conspired all of them together to come

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.100
and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it. Nevertheless, verse number 9 of

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:52.220
Nehemiah 4, we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch against them day and

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:58.580
night because of them. What's the response? Pray. He's a man of prayer. In our

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.460
chapter, in Nehemiah chapter number 6, the chapter in which we're studying this

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:06.220
morning, we find that in verse number 9, the last phrase of the verse says,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:12.260
Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. I mean, that's a short prayer, is it not?

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:18.980
But he was a man that communed with the Lord. He was a man of prayer. And so when he's

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.860
facing this situation and they're trying to weaken their hands, they're trying to

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.780
discourage them and cause them to be feared so that the work would be hindered, we find

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:35.260
that Nehemiah prays, Strengthen my hands. In verse number 14, we find that he

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.900
prays, it says, My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sandalit, according to these

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.940
their works, and on the prophets Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.500
have, the prophetess Noadiah, excuse me, and the rest of the prophets that would

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:56.619
have put me in fear. Another reference to fear. We find that Nehemiah was a man of

00:28:56.619 --> 00:29:01.540
prayer, but how did he deal with the methods? How did he deal with the attack? Well, number

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.420
one, they invited him to go to one of the villages in the plain of Ono, and I would

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:12.540
say this, that Nehemiah rejected the invitation. He rejected the invitation. Sometimes we ought

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.220
to say no. I've often said from Nehemiah chapter number 6, they invited him to Ono,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.220
and he said, Oh no, amen. I ain't going there. I'm not leaving the work. Why should

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:29.820
the work cease? Why should it be hindered? No, I'm not going. We've got to learn how

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:36.300
to say no. Amen? Well, but they invited me, and they're going to think I'm going to...

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:47.619
Learn to say no. Amen? Honestly. No appearance of evil. Sometimes they're inviting you to

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:55.300
go to that place so they can slander you, like they were trying to do to Nehemiah. Right?

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.660
Not only did he reject the invitation, he refuted the claim. In the claim of verse 6

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.940
and 7, in that open letter...

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.140
was that Nehemiah wanted to be the king.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.980
He refuted that.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.220
V. 8, he says,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.800
"...then I sent unto them, saying,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.560
there are no such things done as thou sayest,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.340
but thou faintest them out of thine own heart."

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.700
You're just making this stuff up.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.840
No truth to what you're claiming whatsoever.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.240
He refuted the claim.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.440
He resisted the suggestion.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.060
When the man comes, Shemaiah,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.660
and says, hey, you need to go into the temple.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.460
These are going to come and kill you, slay you.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.820
He resisted that suggestion.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.340
He was able to have perception.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.180
And I believe that in v. 12

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.620
when he says, lo, I perceived,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.340
it's that level of having that discernment

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.660
that only God gives.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.700
And say, no, I'm not permitted to do that.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.780
And notice what he says in v. 11.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.980
I mean, think about it.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.460
He's saying they're going to come.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.340
In the night will they come to slay thee?

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.380
At the end of v. 10.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.380
And notice what Nehemiah says in v. 11.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.180
Should such a man as I flee?

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.860
Think about what he just prayed in v. 9.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.660
Oh God, strengthen my hands.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.220
Nehemiah, they're going to come kill you,

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.180
and then I run in fear.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.139
No, no, no.

00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:15.740
I just prayed that God would strengthen me.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.180
Should such a man as I flee?

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.420
And who is there that being as I am

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.620
would go into the temple to save his life?

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.819
I will not go in.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.540
I like his resolve.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.660
I believe that Nehemiah remained steadfast.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.459
As we think about that infiltration

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:38.779
that was mentioned in v. 17-19

00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:40.779
and the relationship of Tobiah

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:42.620
with the nobles of Judah

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.580
through his wife and his daughter-in-law,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.779
and all of the letters that would go back and forth,

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:51.540
I believe that Nehemiah, he remained steadfast.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.180
I mean, no doubt it was a constant bombardment.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.580
No doubt it was a regular thing.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.340
I mean, they're sending letters back and forth

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.139
and they're seeking to cause him to be afraid,

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:03.700
but I find that Nehemiah was a man

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.900
that remained steadfast.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.420
For us as New Testament believers,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.419
get our eyes on the Lord

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:13.300
and just continue to march forward

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.300
to do the work that God has called us to do.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.500
We find that number one,

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.660
we need to learn to recognize the enemy,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.619
to be able to identify the enemy.

00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:26.900
And it's not always easy.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.059
We need discernment

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.500
to try the spirits, as John says.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.619
To know that we're engaged

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:37.260
in spiritual wickedness in high places,

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.779
the spiritual warfare that is taking place

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:43.100
in our society still even today.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.260
It is raging.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.740
Oh, how we need the discernment of God

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.900
to be able to recognize, identify the enemy.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.460
And then we need to learn how to resist the enemy.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.419
It starts with submitting ourselves to God.

00:32:59.419 --> 00:33:02.699
Being a man of prayer like Nehemiah.

00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:05.020
Seeking the face of God.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.540
Praying daily,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.380
God, would You help me to have

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.260
the discernment as I go throughout my day

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.260
to be able to identify,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.540
to recognize the enemy

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.540
and to see how the enemy would like

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.419
to hinder the work that You're doing in and through me.

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:23.660
We learn how to resist.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.940
Number three this morning,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.860
I believe that we need to learn how to rejoice

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.580
in the work of the Lord.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.100
We notice verses 15 and 16.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.860
I would say this as we would look at these verses.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.380
Thinking about the truth of rejoicing,

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.740
I am so thankful for the truth

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.139
that greater is He that is in you

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:46.059
than he that is in the world.

00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:48.699
We are on the winning side.

00:33:48.699 --> 00:33:50.860
Have you read the book of Revelation?

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.020
We win! Amen?

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.580
You say, it's not looking so good.

00:33:54.619 --> 00:33:56.460
Look to Jesus.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.059
Don't worry about all this craziness.

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:00.380
They're trying to hinder you.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.419
They're trying to stop you.

00:34:01.419 --> 00:34:04.380
They're trying to hinder the work of God.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.380
Say, listen, we're on the winning side.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.460
We win!

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.860
Jesus is the victor.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.900
Amen?

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.260
Satan is already defeated.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.100
He already knows his demise.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.899
Revelation 20 and verse 10,

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:21.380
that old serpent,

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.179
he's cast in the lake of fire

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.299
and he will suffer and be tormented

00:34:25.299 --> 00:34:30.899
day and night forever and ever.

00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:31.700
Amen?

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.299
Curtis Hudson used to sing often.

00:34:33.299 --> 00:34:35.380
I never had the privilege of meeting

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.980
or being in a meeting with Dr. Curtis Hudson.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.540
In fact, he went home to be with the Lord

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.779
when I was just a little infant.

00:34:43.779 --> 00:34:45.260
But I read many things about him

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.500
and often he would preach

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.100
and he would preach and he would sing.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.940
I'm on the winning side.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.019
Amen?

00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:56.140
Rejoicing.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.260
Notice the first four or five words here

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.339
of verse number 15.

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:03.540
So the wall was finished.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.500
Isn't that good?

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.700
Isn't that good?

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:11.019
The wall was finished.

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:13.420
In the twenty and fifth day

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.019
of the month Elu,

00:35:16.019 --> 00:35:19.059
in fifty and two days.

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:22.459
Of course, those that would like to attack

00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:24.260
the authenticity and the accuracy

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.140
of the Word of God

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.260
would say of this verse,

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.739
it's impossible that it could be done

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:30.140
in fifty-two days.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.540
Listen, with God,

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.459
nothing shall be impossible.

00:35:33.459 --> 00:35:34.540
Amen?

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.540
They had a lot of people.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.019
If you go back and read through

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:40.459
the entirety of chapter number three

00:35:40.459 --> 00:35:41.619
and you read of all of the people

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:42.619
that were working

00:35:42.619 --> 00:35:43.860
and all the things that were going on

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.140
and you think about the size of the work,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.739
you also understand that the Babylonians

00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:49.580
did not utterly take down

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.700
every single piece of the wall.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.019
And you understand, listen,

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:54.660
you put God into the equation,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.500
it changes everything.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.619
Amen?

00:35:57.619 --> 00:36:00.059
And they finished the wall.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:01.660
Not only did they finish the wall,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.420
and I understand you don't really see

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.540
much rejoicing here,

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.299
but I think that there was rejoicing

00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:08.820
on the part of the people of God

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.580
as they finished the wall.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.179
But when we're rejoicing in the work of the Lord,

00:36:13.179 --> 00:36:15.019
we know in verse number 16

00:36:15.019 --> 00:36:17.420
that even the enemies had to recognize

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.019
that the work was wrought of God.

00:36:20.019 --> 00:36:21.940
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 16.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.540
And it came to pass

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.059
that when all our enemies heard thereof

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:29.100
and all the heathen that were about us

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.220
saw these things,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.980
that they were much cast down in their own eyes,

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.059
for they perceived that this work

00:36:38.059 --> 00:36:40.380
was wrought of our God.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.380
Listen, when even the enemy recognizes

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.140
this is the work of God,

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.380
that's what I want to see.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.220
Amen?

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.980
I want to just be a church

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.339
that's so submitted to God,

00:36:54.339 --> 00:36:57.500
that's so just steadfast

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.540
in the work that God has called us to do,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.860
that even the enemy would say,

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:05.059
that's the work of God.

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:07.899
Do you remember when Moses and Aaron

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:10.019
were dealing with Pharaoh?

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:11.339
The plagues?

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:13.220
The book of Exodus?

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.660
And I mean, the land of Egypt

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.019
was just tattered and torn.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.739
It was just destroyed through those plagues.

00:37:21.299 --> 00:37:22.299
In the beginning,

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.500
what is it that Pharaoh did?

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.380
Well, after they saw a miracle by Moses and Aaron,

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.100
he called his magicians.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.140
Said, hey guys, you do the same thing they just did.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.980
And they do.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.220
I never could understand

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.220
when Pharaoh has his cronies bring more frogs.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.059
Does that make any sense to you?

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:46.299
They had frogs everywhere.

00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:48.500
In the bed chamber, in the oven,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.339
and they were everywhere.

00:37:50.339 --> 00:37:52.580
And he's gonna have his boys bring more frogs?

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.019
It don't even make sense.

00:37:56.339 --> 00:37:57.500
But that's what he did.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.500
But eventually,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.100
you go through that passage of scripture,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.940
those chapters in the book of Exodus,

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.140
and even the magicians come to Pharaoh and say,

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.500
this is the finger of God.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.980
This is the finger of God.

00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:17.980
These enemies.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.700
Do you think the enemies wanted to recognize

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.860
that God did this?

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.220
No, but there was no other explanation.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.380
They came to this place

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.940
where they're cast down in their own eyes.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.779
They're defeated.

00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:33.899
We did everything we could do.

00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:36.859
I mean, it was a full court press.

00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:38.979
We pulled out all the stops, all the tricks.

00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:41.140
We hired people and we tried to deceive

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.140
and we did everything.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.460
And the work was finished.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.419
The work was finished.

00:38:46.419 --> 00:38:48.539
Let me share with you this morning

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:50.739
a few promises from the Word of God

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:52.140
for us as the people of God.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.500
Go to the book of Matthew, if you will.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.059
In Matthew chapter number 16.

00:38:56.059 --> 00:38:57.780
You believe the Bible this morning?

00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:01.260
Every word, amen?

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.820
Every word of God is pure.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.900
So thankful for the Word of God.

00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:09.099
We sing, we didn't sing it this morning,

00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:12.900
but we sing standing on the promises, amen?

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.419
Peter says they're exceeding great and precious promises.

00:39:16.419 --> 00:39:18.859
Paul says that we can be confident

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:20.179
in the promises of God.

00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:22.700
In Him, they're yay, amen?

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.419
Listen, what God says, He will do.

00:39:25.419 --> 00:39:26.859
Notice Matthew 16.

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.739
It's right in the midst of the portion

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:31.380
in which Jesus asked the disciples,

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.140
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man am?

00:39:35.659 --> 00:39:38.419
Then He says, but whom say ye that I am?

00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:40.380
See, because the answer that they say

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.500
that you're John the Baptist,

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.260
you're one of the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah, someone else,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.340
that wasn't the right answer.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.020
So Jesus says, whom say ye that I am?

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.099
And Peter stands up in boldness and declares,

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:53.539
thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:54.380
He's the Messiah.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.220
He's the promised one.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.419
He's God in flesh.

00:39:56.419 --> 00:39:58.979
And we find that Jesus then gives a promise

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:00.900
in verse number 18.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.260
I say also unto you,

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.059
that thou shalt not be deceived by any man,

00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:06.500
but by the Son of Man,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.659
and by the Son of Man,

00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:08.659
and by the Son of Man,

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:09.500
and by the Son of Man,

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:18.380
to thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:24.140
of hell shall not prevail against it."

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.739
Now we know that verse.

00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:31.579
I want you to turn there and look at it because I want it to impact us today.

00:40:31.579 --> 00:40:33.700
Jesus said, I will build my church.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.260
It's not our church, it's His church.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.239
And He said, I will build my church.

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:42.959
And He said, furthermore, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:45.680
Does that mean they're not even going to try?

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.759
They've been trying from the beginning.

00:40:47.759 --> 00:40:52.479
In Acts chapter number 3 and 4, you see the persecution intensify.

00:40:52.479 --> 00:40:57.080
In chapter number 8, it goes to a whole other level.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:04.759
And you find the promise though of God Almighty that the gates of hell shall not prevail against

00:41:04.759 --> 00:41:05.759
it.

00:41:05.759 --> 00:41:06.959
I'm so thankful for that.

00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:11.759
Listen, there's going to be a day when God's done with the church.

00:41:11.759 --> 00:41:16.480
And that's when we get to go to be with Him, amen?

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.760
The church is the organism that God is using during this particular time of history.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.440
And He's using the church and He says, I'm going to build it and the gates of hell shall

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.680
not prevail against it.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.440
Look here at the book of Romans in chapter number 8.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.739
I just want to share a few promises with you to encourage you this morning.

00:41:35.739 --> 00:41:40.860
As we think about the enemy, even as Nehemiah would face an enemy, and even still today

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:46.779
as we face an enemy that would seek to, yes, their ultimate desire is to destroy the work,

00:41:46.779 --> 00:41:49.059
but they want to hinder the work.

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:54.379
They want to do anything they can to hinder the work of God.

00:41:54.379 --> 00:42:01.180
Romans chapter number 8 and verse number 31, what shall we then say to these things?

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:07.940
If God be for us, who can be against us?

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.980
I want to be on God's side, amen?

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.260
If God be for us, who can be against us?

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.539
Notice what he says in verse number 37, nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:24.539
through Him that loved us.

00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:25.539
More than conquerors.

00:42:25.539 --> 00:42:28.259
I've already said we're on the winning side.

00:42:28.259 --> 00:42:33.259
What a joy, what a blessing to be victorious, to be conquerors.

00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:40.020
Listen, for too long now the church has acted as if we have no power.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.419
The church has laid down and allowed the enemy to just keep on marching.

00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:49.059
The church has said we shouldn't get involved with these things, we shouldn't talk about

00:42:49.059 --> 00:42:51.259
these things, we're going to keep it to ourselves.

00:42:51.259 --> 00:42:56.860
No, no, we're to go forth and make a difference, amen?

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.179
We're on the winning side.

00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:03.139
We go in the power of the Lord God Almighty.

00:43:03.139 --> 00:43:06.940
And if God be for us, who can be against us?

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.059
You say, well I have a whole list of people that are against us.

00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:13.419
Yeah, I do too.

00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:18.500
But with God, we're a majority, amen?

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.539
Look at 1 Corinthians 15.

00:43:21.539 --> 00:43:28.619
We mentioned that one of the ways in which Nehemiah resisted the enemy was that he remained

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:31.139
steadfast.

00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:36.820
We find in 1 Corinthians 15 in verse number 58.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.899
Another familiar verse of Scripture.

00:43:40.899 --> 00:43:44.979
Verse 57 says, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

00:43:44.979 --> 00:43:45.979
Christ.

00:43:45.979 --> 00:43:53.740
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.740
the Lord.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.740
Why?

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.740
Why?

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.460
For as much as ye know.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.460
Every word of God is for you.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:07.300
He didn't say for as much as you think, for as much as we hope, for as much as you know

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:13.220
that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:21.580
Listen, when we go in the power of God Almighty and we're going forth into the battlefield

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.500
and we're giving the truth of the Word of God and we're battling over the souls of men,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.859
you can understand that our work is not in vain in the Lord.

00:44:30.859 --> 00:44:32.500
God is working.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.619
God uses His Word.

00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:36.779
He promises to do so.

00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:39.739
You say, well I just don't see how God is working.

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:42.019
You just remain steadfast.

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:50.040
See, sometimes what we know has to supersede what we think.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.619
We look at the surface and we say, I think this isn't working.

00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:55.019
I think I'm not making any progress.

00:44:55.019 --> 00:45:00.299
I think it's just, no, no, we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:45:00.299 --> 00:45:03.619
I think about what Paul said in Romans chapter number 8.

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:07.019
You don't need to turn there, but when we talk about all things work together for good

00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:12.980
to them that love God, it starts out with, and we know, because sometimes when we're

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:18.459
in the midst of something, we might sit there and say, how is this going to work for good?

00:45:18.459 --> 00:45:22.940
What we know has to supersede what we think.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:29.100
And he says here that we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:41.739
Philippians chapter number 1, Paul is writing to this church, he's in prison.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:45.619
This church had communicated with him many times.

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:52.140
They gave, they were a precious group of people to Paul.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.619
Paul says they're a precious group of people to him, prayed for them.

00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:01.179
I mean, the beginning of chapter number 1 of the book of Philippians is just powerful

00:46:01.179 --> 00:46:06.380
to see the relationship that they had, the love.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.940
And notice what Paul says to these believers in Philippians 1 and verse number 6, being

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940
confident.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.459
Don't you like that word?

00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:17.019
That's a good word.

00:46:17.019 --> 00:46:27.220
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.380
it until the day of Jesus Christ, being confident.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:40.339
Listen, this morning, as we look at Nehemiah chapter number 6, and it happened 2,500 years

00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:50.220
ago, just about, and you think about the events and the situation that Nehemiah dealt with,

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:56.299
do you see that things have changed somewhat, but the basics of the spiritual warfare that

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:01.380
we deal with, it remains the same, 2,500 years.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:10.100
Oh, we have different technology now, thankfully we have some modern conveniences now, right?

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:17.019
But the enemy, still working today in the same way that he was 2,500 years ago, and

00:47:17.019 --> 00:47:23.579
he wants to deceive you, and he wants to deceive me, and one thing that he uses is fear, fear.

00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:28.700
When we look at these promises of God that we've looked at in the New Testament, and

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:39.619
we are mindful that over and over that God says to his people, fear not, be not afraid.

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:46.179
Over and over and over we read those words in this precious book.

00:47:46.179 --> 00:48:00.899
I'm mindful of the truth of Hebrews 13, in verses 5 and 6, the Bible says in Hebrews

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:07.339
13 verse 5, let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things

00:48:07.339 --> 00:48:15.019
as you have, completely different message in that portion of verse number 5, but notice

00:48:15.019 --> 00:48:19.619
what he says at the end of verse number 5, for he hath said, I will never leave thee

00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:22.820
nor forsake thee, isn't that precious?

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:32.299
But you know what the result of that understanding is, is verse number 6, so that we may boldly

00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:44.299
say the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:48:44.299 --> 00:48:46.960
Why is it that you do not have any fear?

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.179
Because the Lord is my helper, the Lord is my helper, and he said I'll never leave thee

00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:52.940
nor forsake thee.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.580
Remember Psalm 121, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help?

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:03.979
My help cometh from the Lord, notice this, which made heaven and earth.

00:49:03.979 --> 00:49:05.520
Now how did he make it?

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.179
He spoke and it was so, amen?

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:13.380
The wonder of creation, God said and it was so.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:24.340
The power of creation, and he's my helper, he's your helper, he's Nehemiah's helper.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.219
How could Nehemiah continue with all that was going on?

00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:32.419
I mean day after day after day, the work being opposed and all of the adversity, he's a man

00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:33.419
of prayer.

00:49:33.419 --> 00:49:36.659
He learned how to recognize the enemy.

00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:41.460
He learned how to resist the enemy, and I believe that as we look at the completion

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.820
of the wall, we rejoice in the work of God.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:54.099
This morning I pray that God would help us to recognize the enemy and to resist the enemy

00:49:54.099 --> 00:49:58.059
and to keep on keeping on.

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:04.820
One day it's all going to be over, whether it's by death or by rapture, it's going to

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.500
be over.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.460
But until then, oh that God would help us.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:16.180
to just press on and say, look, I'm not looking for some cave to run to and hide in.

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.180
I'm not.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:23.460
People want to move to Idaho and wherever else they want to move to, we're 16 miles

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.460
from the White House.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:30.260
Oh, man, we're in the thick of it, amen?

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.580
Come on.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:37.700
They're legislating all kinds of wickedness, but we are on the winning side.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.700
And we say, we want to, we want to recognize the enemy.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.420
Sometimes it's real easy.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:50.460
Other times it takes great levels of discernment that only God can give us, and oh, that we

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:55.660
would resist and see God work and do what only He can do, amen?

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.380
I'm glad Nehemiah didn't give up.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.140
Can you imagine?

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.100
Well, it's just too hard.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.140
We just kind of, boys go home, close down shop, we're not going to continue this.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.980
They don't want us to do it.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.980
No.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.980
They were persistent.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.380
They just kept on, kept on, keeping on.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.380
Let's pray.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.060
Father, we love You.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.100
Thank You for loving us.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:24.660
Thank You for this passage, and though the events occurred over 2,000 years ago, we see

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.900
such similarities of what we deal with today.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:38.060
Oh, how we need perception, discernment, to be able to recognize and identify the enemy.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.620
We understand the truth that You have given to us in Your Word with regard to resisting

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:48.540
the enemy, and I trust that You would help us to follow the pattern, the discipline of

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:53.080
Nehemiah that we see in Nehemiah chapter 6.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.920
Help us this morning to leave this place encouraged because of the promises that You've

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.040
given us in Your Word.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.880
We're thankful for the good work that You have started.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.320
We know that You will complete it.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.880
We know that You said that You would build Your church, and the gates of hell shall not

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.960
prevail against it.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:18.080
Lord, I pray You'd help us to be a people that are fully surrendered to You, a people

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:25.040
that are yielded, that would allow You to do what only You can do, that even the enemy

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.000
would have to look at it and say, the Lord did that.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.160
Oh, God, we pray that You'd work in that way.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:39.680
Use this time of invitation as only You can to convict and to convince and to change we,

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680
Your people.

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:50.960
That we might go out of here with a revived focus and a resolve to serve You faithfully.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.320
It's in Christ's name we pray.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.080
Would you stand with me?

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.280
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:03.200
Jared's going to play quietly on the piano, and as he is playing, the altar is open.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.000
Come to this old-fashioned altar, make your seat an altar.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.240
Would you submit to God, surrender to God?

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.040
Let God use you.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.840
Ask Him to help you to have that ability, that discernment to recognize and identify

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.960
the enemy.

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.680
As Jared plays, the altar is open.
