1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
Revelation chapter number 2, be looking at verses 12 through 17 as we deal with the church

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,380
in Pergamos.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,880
And we'll be looking here at these few verses of scripture.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,720
The city of Pergamos was located about 45 miles north of Smyrna.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,840
Of course, it's been a few weeks since we've been here on a Sunday night looking at the

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
book of Revelation.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,760
We've had a couple of other evenings and different things going on on Sunday nights, but it's

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,280
been almost a month actually since we've been in the book of Revelation.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,680
And so the last study was on the church in Smyrna, verses 8 through 11, and this city

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,840
of Pergamos is located at 45 miles or so north of Smyrna.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,439
The city was known for pagan polytheistic religion, including emperor worship.

12
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,000
And so it was a real exciting place to live.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,080
All sorts of idolatry and wickedness and lots of religion, quote unquote.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:06,919
Of course, no true, the lack of true gospel preaching was limited.

15
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:12,120
Obviously the church in Pergamos is there, but there's much false teaching, false religion

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,519
and all that was going on.

17
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,879
The city was known, it's believed that parchment type paper was first used here in the city

18
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,879
of Pergamos.

19
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,080
That's just kind of an interesting thought or fact.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,160
It's also reported, if you were to study through history, that this city had a library

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,519
quite extensive that had about 200,000 volumes.

22
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,440
And so we're going to think about this as in the first century, we're going to think

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,279
about a library with 200,000 volumes.

24
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,120
It's pretty significant.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,839
And so we find that as we look at this text of scripture, we see a little bit about what's

26
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:47,559
going on in the city and what they would be aware of.

27
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,800
But we understand as we're looking at the book of Revelation and these letters that

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,319
are written to the churches, the idea is not so much to study the cities and know too

29
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,000
many things about them specifically, but to look at the evaluation that God gives of the

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
individual churches.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,800
It's his church and he loved the church and gave himself for it.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,320
He purchased it with his own blood according to Acts chapter 20.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,699
And we find that he is the head of the church and he's writing, having John write these

35
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,300
letters to the church as he's giving an evaluation.

36
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,899
And we know immediately as we have with the previous two letters, how the Lord is described

37
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:31,899
for us.

38
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:37,160
We noticed in the first letter to the church at Ephesus that it talked about the Lord Jesus

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,419
Christ, that he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst

40
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,259
of the seven golden candlesticks.

41
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,619
And then to Smyrna, these things saith the first and the last, which was dead and is

42
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,619
alive.

43
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:57,820
But notice now in verse number 12, the Bible says, and to the angel of the church in Pergamos

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:06,419
write, these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

45
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,820
We mentioned in chapter number one, as we looked at the great description that is given

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,240
of the Lord Jesus Christ, about the fact that he's described in so many amazing ways

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,979
and understanding that he has a name, the word of God.

48
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,940
We looked at Revelation 19 and we looked at a number of those things.

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,300
And now we find that it says, he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,020
Immediately my mind goes to Hebrews chapter four and verse number 12.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,119
If you want to just very quickly look at that verse of scripture and notice what the Bible

52
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:42,160
says in Hebrews 4 and verse number 12, as we consider this introductory statement.

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,520
And here in Hebrews 4 and verse 12, the Bible says this, for the word of God is quick.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,600
It means it's alive.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,759
I'm thankful that God's word is a living book.

56
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,240
The Bible says, for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,600
sword.

58
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,800
And notice it says, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,740
and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,040
That's a powerful verse of scripture.

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,279
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's having John pen this letter to the church

62
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:29,119
in Pergamos, he says, he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

63
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,119
It's not dull.

64
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,119
It's sharp.

65
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,480
The word of God is quick.

66
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
It's powerful.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,399
It's a living book.

68
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,760
And the Lord Jesus Christ has a name according to Revelation 19, the word of God.

69
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,079
And so we look here and begin to look at this evaluation of the church.

70
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,760
I want you to note number one, how they flourished.

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,320
Notice as we look at that familiar statement, I know thy works.

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,959
We've read that of the church at Ephesus.

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,959
We've read of the church in Smyrna.

74
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,160
We'll read it in each of the churches.

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,480
And we see here that in verse number 13, the Lord says, I know thy works.

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,480
You understand this evening that there's nothing that you can hide from God.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,119
There's absolutely nothing that you can hide from God.

78
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,559
Adam and Eve tried to hide from God.

79
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,160
How'd that work for them?

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,720
It didn't work.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,239
David tried to hide some stuff from God.

82
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,239
How'd that work?

83
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,959
Well, he told Nathan all about it.

84
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,679
And Nathan stood before David and said, thou art the man, right?

85
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:29,880
And we can go on and on and we can understand this evening that God knows everything.

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,119
Listen, he knows your motives.

87
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:37,480
He knows the thoughts that you have, that he knows everything about us.

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,720
He knows our works.

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,799
He knows why we do the things that we do.

90
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:48,540
And it says here, I know thy works and where thou dwellest.

91
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:57,540
That's how he describes the place Pergamos, even where Satan's seat is.

92
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,859
And thou notice, as we look at this verse of scripture and look at how they flourished,

93
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:10,660
it says, and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith.

94
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,380
Even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you, where

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Satan dwelleth.

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,579
As we look at verse 13 and begin to think about how they flourished, I want you to consider

97
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:28,339
a few thoughts here with regard to the church in Pergamos and what they were doing and how

98
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,779
they were being used of the Lord.

99
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,079
Number one, they were a light in a dark place.

100
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,540
They were a light in a dark place.

101
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,339
It says that where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is.

102
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,940
Sometimes we can get sideways over the place where God has us, maybe being a wicked place,

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,899
an ungodly place, but the reality is that God has put us in this world, though we're

104
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:57,820
not of the world, and he's called us to be a light.

105
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,619
The book of Philippians in chapter two and verse number 15, the Bible says that you may

106
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,480
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,540
perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,619
Jesus said that we're to let our light shine.

109
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:18,899
We understand, we sing the song with the kids, this little light of mine, I'm gonna

110
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,540
let it shine.

111
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,179
I'm not gonna let Satan blow it out, I'm not gonna hide it in a bushel, no, I'm gonna let

112
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:28,940
it shine till Jesus comes, and we sing all those verses with the little kids and we understand

113
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,859
the importance of being that light.

114
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:39,779
And here, the church in Pergamos, they were living in a wicked, pagan, idolatrous, polytheistic

115
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,320
society, and yet they were shining as a light.

116
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,760
What a great example for us, what a great reminder of the importance to continue to

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,519
shine the light of the gospel.

118
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,059
We find that not only were they a light in a dark place, but the Bible says that they

119
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:07,920
held fast his name, notice it says, and thou holdest fast my name.

120
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm thankful that even in the midst of a pagan society, even in the midst of idolatrous

121
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,320
worship that we can hold fast the name of Jesus.

122
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,200
Jesus indeed is the sweetest name I know, and we ought to lift high the name of the

123
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Lord Jesus Christ, we ought to not be ashamed of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,500
He's my savior, and I love him, and he says to this church that thou holdest fast my name,

125
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,799
verse number three, and hast not denied my faith.

126
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,820
Can you understand just for a moment as we begin to think about this church in Pergamos

127
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,460
and the city and the idolatry and the wickedness and the emperor worship and how if you did

128
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,700
not follow their religious practices, they would literally make your life miserable.

129
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,299
They would try to make it so that you cannot survive.

130
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,380
Not so that you cannot thrive, but literally so that you cannot even survive.

131
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,219
You must follow their rules.

132
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:16,979
You must do as they tell you to do, and yet we find that this church, they did not deny

133
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:18,979
the faith.

134
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,219
They did not deny the faith.

135
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,840
Can you imagine the pressures?

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,179
The overwhelming pressures that they would face in society, but yet we find that here

137
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,979
the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's giving this evaluation, he says that you're shining in

138
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:42,059
this dark place, that you're holding fast my name, that you've not denied my faith,

139
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:51,559
and then notice he says, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who

140
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,020
was slain among you where Satan dwelleth.

141
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,020
It's interesting that he said at the beginning of the verse, even where Satan's...

142
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,100
C is, and at the end, where Satan dwelleth.

143
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,220
But he talks about this fact that they were faithful

144
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,460
in the midst of great persecution.

145
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,180
He says in those days, can you imagine

146
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,360
the church in Pergamos?

147
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,740
I mean, they obviously knew the events

148
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,880
surrounding the death of Antipas.

149
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,420
They would be familiar with all that had transpired,

150
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,220
and as the Lord says that even in those days

151
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,700
where in Antipas, my faithful martyr

152
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,300
who was slain among you,

153
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,660
could it be that some within the church,

154
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,260
not only brothers and sisters in Christ,

155
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,360
but perhaps even family members,

156
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,380
they're being reminded of being faithful unto death,

157
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,900
being faithful unto death.

158
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,220
And here the church was flourishing in these ways,

159
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,220
and we can rejoice in that, and we can take note,

160
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,620
and we can say, okay, God knows our works,

161
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,100
and it's good that God would acknowledge

162
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,500
and God would recognize that here's some things,

163
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,800
here's some areas where you're doing

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,180
what you're supposed to be doing,

165
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,500
but we understand as we continue through the text,

166
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,340
not only how they flourished, but number two,

167
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,700
we know how they faltered.

168
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,700
We see in verse 14 and 15 in these two verses,

169
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,580
and in verse number 14 specifically,

170
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,980
notice the Bible begins,

171
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,180
but I have a few things against thee.

172
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,180
These are words that are no doubt difficult to receive.

173
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,040
These are words that given an evaluation,

174
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,060
you do not wanna hear.

175
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,260
I have a few things against thee.

176
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,460
Remember as we looked at the church in Ephesus,

177
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,460
the Bible said, nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee

178
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,900
because thou hast left thy first love.

179
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
And we find here that he says,

180
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,540
but I have a few things against thee.

181
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,500
Notice what he mentioned specifically.

182
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,100
The first thing that he mentioned specifically

183
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,580
is the doctrine of Balaam.

184
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,260
It says this in verse number 14,

185
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,860
because thou hast there them that hold

186
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,440
the doctrine of Balaam,

187
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,540
who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block

188
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,900
before the children of Israel

189
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,700
to eat things sacrificed unto idols

190
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,540
and to commit fornication.

191
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,500
Now it's kind of interesting

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,140
because here in Revelation chapter two

193
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
in verse number 14,

194
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,620
it refers to this situation

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,260
as being the doctrine of Balaam.

196
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,120
In second Peter chapter two in verse number 15,

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,660
the Bible refers to it as being the way of Balaam.

198
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,500
And in Jude verse number 11,

199
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,440
the Bible refers to it as being the error of Balaam.

200
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,880
But here we find that God refers to this teaching,

201
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,660
this doctrine, and he refers to it

202
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,740
as being the doctrine of Balaam.

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,940
And there were some there that held,

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,320
it says that thou hast there

205
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,900
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam.

206
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,620
So if we find that Jesus is referencing

207
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,100
to this church in Revelation,

208
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,720
this church in Pergamos about this doctrine of Balaam,

209
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,700
we ought to know what that is.

210
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,780
Begin to read about that in Numbers chapter 22 through 25.

211
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,660
We won't read all of that obviously,

212
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,800
but turn back if you will to Numbers chapter 25.

213
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,820
Numbers chapter 25, and I want you to notice some things.

214
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,460
In beginning in chapter 22,

215
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,280
we won't have time to go through it,

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,900
but we find that Balaam is called

217
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,220
in order to curse the people of God.

218
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,620
We find that he blesses the people of God,

219
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,140
he does not curse them.

220
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,940
And there's some very important things

221
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,700
that we learn through that process.

222
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,640
But we come to chapter 25,

223
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,960
and it's here in chapter 25

224
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,400
that God tells us what the children of Israel did.

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,220
And then it's not until chapter 31

226
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,320
that the Bible gives us the reason

227
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,160
by which they did what they did in chapter 25.

228
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
So we're gonna read in chapter 25

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
what the children of Israel did,

230
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,240
then we're gonna go over to chapter 31

231
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,600
and understand the counsel that Balaam gave.

232
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,280
In chapter 25, in verse number one,

233
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,100
the Bible says,

234
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,360
and Israel abode in Shittim,

235
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,960
and the people began to commit whoredom

236
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,280
with the daughters of Moab.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,760
And they called the people

238
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,720
unto the sacrifice of their gods,

239
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,420
and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods.

240
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,040
And Israel joined himself unto Baal Peor,

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,040
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.

242
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,440
Now those are interesting verses of scripture

243
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,120
when you're reading through the dialogue

244
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,960
and you're reading about Balaam being called by Balak

245
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,560
to curse the people of God,

246
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,840
and he cannot curse them, and he blesses them,

247
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,520
and Balak is beside himself.

248
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,600
And you go through chapter 22 and 23 and 24,

249
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,860
and you're reading all of these iterations

250
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,880
of what's going on,

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
and you're reading even in chapter 24,

252
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,560
in verse number 10,

253
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,800
it says that Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam.

254
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,640
Why?

255
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Because this was not what he brought them here for.

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,560
And then all of a sudden,

257
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,040
you start reading chapter 25,

258
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,900
and you say, what happened?

259
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,440
What is going on?

260
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,860
How is it that they committed whoredom

261
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,080
with the daughters of Moab?

262
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,400
How is it that they're eating the sacrifice of their gods,

263
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,900
and they ate, and they're bowing down to their gods?

264
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,340
What in the world?

265
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,860
And you look at chapter 31,

266
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,120
and God gives us insight here in verses 15 and 16

267
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,640
with regard to the counsel of Balaam.

268
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
And notice what the Bible says

269
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
in numbers 31 in verse 15,

270
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,240
"'And Moses said unto them,

271
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,640
"'Have you saved all the women alive?

272
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,040
"'Behold, these caused the children of Israel,

273
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,260
"'through the counsel of Balaam,

274
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,460
"'to commit trespass against the Lord

275
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,800
"'in the matter of Peor.'"

276
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,560
And there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

277
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,520
In verse 16 of numbers 31,

278
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,920
it's referring to that event that we just read

279
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,640
in chapter 25, verses one through three.

280
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,920
And we find that God reveals to us

281
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,220
that it was through the counsel of Balaam.

282
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,680
Let me share something with you

283
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
that I think is vitally important

284
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
that we understand this evening.

285
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,580
You understand tonight that the enemy, our enemy,

286
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,700
he cannot curse us.

287
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,180
God has blessed us.

288
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,120
We are blessed.

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,300
We are the people of God.

290
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,340
We are the children of God.

291
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,960
He cannot curse us.

292
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,260
But you know what he can do?

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,460
He can do the same thing that Balaam did

294
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,060
in giving this counsel.

295
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,660
Since the enemy cannot curse the people of God,

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,280
he sought to corrupt the people of God through compromise.

297
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,940
And here's what happens.

298
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,860
Because of the corruption and the compromise,

299
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,380
the curse comes.

300
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,260
Because of the compromise and the corruption,

301
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,780
the curse comes.

302
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,440
Balaam could not curse the people of God.

303
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Why?

304
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,420
Because they had been blessed by God.

305
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,320
But he gives them counsel to do something

306
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,860
that was in violation to God's law

307
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,200
that would bring forth the judgment of God.

308
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,060
Do you get that tonight?

309
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,720
He could not curse them.

310
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,180
What did Balaam want?

311
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,500
Balaam wanted them to be destroyed.

312
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,920
Balaam says, I can't do it because God's blessed them.

313
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,060
But you know what?

314
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,940
If you corrupt them,

315
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,300
because notice what the Bible says at the end

316
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,860
of verse number three in chapter 25,

317
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,780
the Lord was kindled,

318
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,460
the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.

319
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,620
Why was God's anger kindled against his people?

320
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,900
Because they corrupted themselves.

321
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,220
Because they violated the truth of God's word.

322
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,000
You know, no one can make you sin.

323
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,500
But when you sin, you forfeit the blessing of God.

324
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,860
And you deal with judgment.

325
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,980
And so there's this doctrine of Balaam

326
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,240
that's going on here in the church in Pergamos.

327
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,360
There were some that held to this doctrine of Balaam.

328
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,520
And it all has to do with compromise and corruption.

329
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,980
And as we look at the connection between verse 14 and 15,

330
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,440
we see what's happening here in Pergamos

331
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,020
as we begin to understand how they began to falter.

332
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,119
And there's compromise and there's corruption

333
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,980
because not only the doctrine of Balaam,

334
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
but in verse 15 of Revelation two, the Bible says,

335
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,260
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine

336
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,520
of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

337
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,619
Now, in the city of Ephesus,

338
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,460
according to chapter two in verse number six

339
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,580
here in Revelation,

340
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,880
we read of the deeds of the Nicolaitans.

341
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,580
But now we're reading of the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

342
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,260
And I understand that it's a different city,

343
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,400
it's a different place.

344
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
But I want to remind you of the biblical truth

345
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
from Galatians five, nine,

346
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,679
that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

347
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
You know, sin is a slippery slope and so is compromise.

348
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
You begin to just compromise a little bit here

349
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,520
and a little bit there,

350
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,480
and you change and blur the line here and there.

351
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,600
And before long, it just kind of spirals out of control.

352
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,340
Compromise is a dangerous thing.

353
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,200
And so we find as we begin to think about

354
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
this sect, if you will,

355
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,040
that were referred to as the Nicolaitans,

356
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,320
it's believed that this was a sect of individuals there

357
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,160
that advocated.

358
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,540
for this thought of what we refer to as antinomianism.

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,040
This idea of antinomianism is really this idea

360
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,880
that we have a license to live however we wanna live.

361
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
That we're saved by grace

362
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,200
and therefore we can just do whatever.

363
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,900
I mean, forget about the standards.

364
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,720
Not only do we lower the standards,

365
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,380
but man, we should just eliminate the standards altogether.

366
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,040
But I wanna remind you what Paul said in Romans chapter six.

367
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,120
He said, should we sin that grace may abound?

368
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
What's the answer?

369
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,760
God forbid.

370
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,440
Is that not what Paul says

371
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,980
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

372
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,600
in Romans chapter six?

373
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,200
And so we find that here when we look at this situation

374
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,760
of the faltering church in Pergamos

375
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,440
and we find that they were flourishing.

376
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,680
I mean, they did some things good,

377
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,960
but there were some people within the church.

378
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,160
There were some in verse number 14,

379
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,880
because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam

380
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
in verse number 15,

381
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,720
so has now also them that hold

382
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

383
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
And so there were some within the congregation,

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,540
not all of them,

385
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
but there were some within the congregation

386
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,620
that were holding to this doctrine of Balaam,

387
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,000
that were holding to this doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
And can I share with you this evening

389
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
that they don't just hold it to themselves,

390
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,240
they begin to influence other people.

391
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,720
They begin to peddle their doctrine.

392
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,880
They begin to try to find others to share this with.

393
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,920
And we find that as we're looking at this church

394
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,200
in Pergamos and we're looking at what's happening,

395
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,480
that we have to be so careful

396
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,820
when it comes to this idea of compromise.

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,480
It's absolutely imperative that we resist compromise.

398
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,220
It doesn't mean that we do not seek to do various things

399
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,520
just because maybe something's new or whatever it may be,

400
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,280
but the reality is that we do not wanna forfeit

401
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,820
the blessing of God in order to appease

402
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,280
some group of people.

403
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,240
And as we look here at this text of scripture

404
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,880
and begin to think about where they were located,

405
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,640
and then even beginning to try to make some application

406
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
for us this evening,

407
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,000
we understand that the temptation

408
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,260
will always exist to compromise.

409
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,800
The temptation will always exist to compromise.

410
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
I have followed up with visitors

411
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,640
that have come to our church over the years.

412
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,320
I've been here for 13 and a half years.

413
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,560
I've followed up with countless visitors.

414
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,780
And there's been some visitors that I've gone to

415
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,840
and we've sat with and we visited with,

416
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,480
and they say, well, if you just change that position

417
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,960
on the King James Bible, we'd come back to your church.

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,880
Sorry, we're not gonna change our position

419
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,500
on the King James Bible so that you would come

420
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,340
to our church.

421
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,740
If you just get some different music,

422
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,140
if you just do this, if you just do that,

423
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,980
the reality is that there's always a temptation

424
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,860
to compromise.

425
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,760
And here's what happens, it can almost become pragmatic

426
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,780
where we get that idea that, well, if we do this,

427
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,300
if we just kind of lower this,

428
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,900
if we change this a little bit,

429
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,140
then we'll be able to reach more people.

430
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,020
And so we wanna reach more people,

431
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,620
and so therefore we're going to falter on this area here

432
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,300
because we wanna reach more people.

433
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,300
And there's always a temptation to compromise.

434
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,380
It always exists.

435
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,780
It exists in your home.

436
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,860
It exists with your family.

437
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,060
It exists with your children.

438
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,060
There's always a temptation to compromise.

439
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,140
How do we resist compromise?

440
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,320
How do we avoid compromise?

441
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,120
Not that we just wanna stay in some era

442
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
of we're just not willing to be up with the times

443
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
or whatever it may be.

444
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,440
No, we don't wanna compromise.

445
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
There's a difference.

446
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,640
I'll use the word relevant.

447
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,460
I use it appropriately this evening.

448
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,720
There's a difference between being relevant

449
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,040
and compromising.

450
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,080
We put electricity in our building

451
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
because it's actually kind of comfortable.

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,960
It's not really a compromise.

453
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,440
By the way, that was done well before any of us were here,

454
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,120
but I'm thankful that it was done, aren't you?

455
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,360
Come on.

456
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm thankful for indoor plumbing, right?

457
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,460
Aren't you?

458
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,520
Especially on a night like tonight.

459
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
You gotta, yeah, come on.

460
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,320
I mean, just be, that's not the same as compromise.

461
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,900
So how do we resist it?

462
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,280
How do we avoid it as a church, as a family?

463
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,580
What do we do?

464
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,380
We have to know the truth of God's word.

465
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,900
And we have to be students of the word of God.

466
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,800
We have to commit ourselves to following the principles

467
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,540
that are contained within God's word.

468
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,320
Here's what God's word says,

469
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,840
and here's how we're gonna go.

470
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,260
And here's the reality is that you'll be pushed

471
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,020
and I'll be pushed.

472
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,980
And there are times in which we look to the truth

473
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,340
of God's word and we desire that we want to stay true

474
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,020
to God's word.

475
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,860
We make that commitment that I wanna be true

476
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,540
to the principles that God has laid forth in his word,

477
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,740
and we wanna follow the way of the Lord.

478
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,400
But there's always gonna be a temptation to compromise.

479
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,300
In a city like Pergamos, with all that was going on

480
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,860
and all the pressures that a church would face

481
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,620
and all of the tribulation that they were dealing with,

482
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,060
the persecution that they were facing,

483
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,220
I think it could kind of be easy to be like,

484
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,300
yeah, let's just kind of bend a little bit right here.

485
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,120
Let's just kind of, but no, we don't wanna do that.

486
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,980
And here the Lord says, I have a few things against thee.

487
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,480
Why?

488
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,540
Well, because there are some that have,

489
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,500
they hold to the doctrine of Balaam.

490
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,300
There are some there that hold the doctrine

491
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
of the Nicolaitans.

492
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,060
And so he gives, as he's evaluating the church,

493
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,640
and even as we've mentioned for our own church this evening,

494
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,100
though Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton

495
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
is not in Revelation two or three,

496
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,460
we take these passages of scripture and we say,

497
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,720
what would God say of us?

498
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,760
How would God evaluate us?

499
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Well, in each of the churches that God corrects,

500
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,680
he also gives them counsel

501
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
to be able to correct their course.

502
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I've termed it this way, number three tonight,

503
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,040
the formula for revival, the formula for revival.

504
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,440
The Lord exposes our failures,

505
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,200
those areas where we're faltering

506
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,560
as we see in verse 14 and 15.

507
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,000
So that we would address it, so that we deal with it.

508
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,560
See, because we can deceive ourselves.

509
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,200
We can sit back and say, man, everything's going great.

510
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,400
But no, the Lord steps in and he gives an evaluation.

511
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,400
He provides the truth with regard to where we stand.

512
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,320
And then he provides the formula for revival.

513
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,400
Notice in one word in verse 16, repent.

514
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960
Repent.

515
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,400
You know what every church

516
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,600
and what every believer needs to do is agree with God.

517
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,240
To agree with God.

518
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,400
We're not gonna argue with God.

519
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,300
We're not gonna say, no, that's not how it is.

520
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,720
No, that's not true.

521
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
That's a bad evaluation.

522
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,000
No, God's way is true and God's word is true.

523
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,800
And what God says is fact.

524
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
And he says, repent.

525
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,740
You must change your mind,

526
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,960
which will result in a change of direction.

527
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,920
You must return to the Lord's way and refuse compromise.

528
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,520
There's no middle ground here.

529
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
It's repent.

530
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,540
It's repent.

531
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,820
God's way is always right.

532
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
100% of the time.

533
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,240
God's way is perfect.

534
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,520
And so what we must do is align our thinking

535
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,020
with God's thinking.

536
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,000
The pragmatic approach says, but we're trying,

537
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
look, we're trying to reach more people

538
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
or we're trying to do this or we're trying to do that.

539
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
And God says, repent.

540
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,080
Do God's work God's way.

541
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,380
No compromise.

542
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,440
Notice the or else in verse number 16.

543
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,440
He says, repent or else I will come unto thee quickly

544
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,440
and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

545
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,360
You think God is serious about his church?

546
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,320
I believe he is.

547
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,760
He loved the church and he gave himself for it.

548
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,680
The church is the bride of Christ.

549
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,820
The church is the greatest organism.

550
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,840
I like to use that word, not organization

551
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,540
because it's living.

552
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,580
The church is the greatest organism on the planet earth.

553
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,820
It's the pillar and ground of the truth.

554
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,220
And the Lord Jesus Christ is serious.

555
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,180
And he says, repent.

556
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,940
And if not, or else I will,

557
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,760
notice he says, I will come unto thee quickly.

558
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
God will give us a little space to repent.

559
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,980
I'm thankful for God's grace and his mercy

560
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,240
and his long suffering.

561
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,060
But he says, here's the evaluation.

562
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,120
Change your way.

563
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,780
He doesn't say, here's the evaluation

564
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,580
and we'll come back in a year and reevaluate.

565
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,620
No.

566
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:09,420
here's the evaluation, repent, get it straight, get it right. And he says this

567
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,140
or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the

568
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:22,460
sword of my mouth. I begin to think about that. So often we rejoice in the

569
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,260
promises that God gives, if God be for us who can be against us. Aren't you

570
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,580
thankful for that wonderful promise? But I'm reminded this evening that as

571
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:39,140
Jeremiah was prophesying to the people of Judah and they send and they say

572
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,580
will God fight for us? He says no, God's gonna fight against us. Why was God

573
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,820
gonna fight against his own people? Because of their disobedience, their sin,

574
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,580
their idolatry. And I don't want to be in a place where where it would be that

575
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,940
God would fight against with the sword of his mouth. Those people, those groups

576
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,300
that were in the church that held to the doctrine of Balaam, to the doctrine of

577
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,260
the Nicolaitans, they had to be dealt with. It had to be addressed. There needed

578
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,700
to be repentance. These letters that God gives to these churches, they're serious.

579
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:30,380
Why? Because God's church is precious and God is concerned about the holiness of

580
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:39,020
his people and the holiness of his church. The church is not a club. It's the body of

581
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:49,060
Christ and we're to follow God's way. And the Bible says in verse 17 as we

582
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:55,060
end each of these letters in the similar fashion, the consistency in each

583
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:04,060
of them, I know thy works. But also as we read in verse 17, he that hath an ear, let

584
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:11,940
him hear what the Spirit saith unto, remember, the churches, plural. I believe

585
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,060
that these seven churches that are addressed, this letter would go and they

586
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,940
would read not only their own evaluation, but they would read the evaluations of

587
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,820
the others. Why? Because he that hath an ear, let him hear. Listen, I can learn

588
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,220
from the evaluation that God gives us, but we can learn from the evaluation that God

589
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,420
gives another church. And here, as we have Revelation 2 and 3, there are seven

590
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,300
churches that we can learn from. And God has preserved it for all of church history

591
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,860
so that we could have these letters, so that we could learn the lessons that we

592
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,620
need to learn, that we could be aware of the danger of compromise, that we could

593
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,460
understand how that the enemy wants us to corrupt, he wants us to disobey so that

594
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,980
we would be judged, so that we would lose the good hand of God's favor in our

595
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:11,100
lives, in our ministry. And he says this, to him that overcometh. I've mentioned in

596
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,500
the previous lessons, as we look at that phrase in these particular letters, that

597
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,300
that's the one that is victorious. I'm thankful even for the truth, and we sang

598
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,940
about this the other night in 1 John chapter number 5, where the Bible says in

599
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,100
verse number 4, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the

600
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,020
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. I'm thankful that we are more

601
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,340
than conquerors through Christ. I'm thankful that we are on the winning side,

602
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:49,140
that we're victorious. But we understand that as we look here at this thought of

603
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,660
being victorious and dealing with the instruction, the counsel that God has

604
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,740
given, that he provides here. Remember to the church in Smyrna, he said, he that

605
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,420
overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death. What a blessing to know that I'm

606
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,700
saved by the grace of God. I'm on, I'm born again, I'm on the winning side, and

607
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,820
the second death hath no power over me, according to Revelation 20. But here I

608
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:19,060
want you to notice that God says three things to the one that's victorious, that

609
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:26,100
overcomes. It says that I will give to eat of the hidden manna, of the hidden

610
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,540
manna. It's kind of interesting phraseology. We're familiar with manna in

611
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,740
the Old Testament. We're familiar with how God miraculously sent bread from

612
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:43,260
heaven to feed his people, and how if they took up too much on a particular

613
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,540
day, that it would breed worms, and it would stink, and it would spoil. But then

614
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,940
on a particular day, because they would not go out on the Sabbath, they would

615
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,660
have to gather twice as much. And even in so doing, it did not spoil, it did not

616
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:06,540
rot, it did not stink, did not breed worms. And so we're familiar with the manna of

617
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,340
that God sent from heaven to feed his people, but now we look here and the

618
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,740
Bible says that I will give to eat of the hidden manna. I believe that

619
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:25,260
God is referring here to the spiritual provision through his word. Let me say it

620
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:32,300
this way, I believe what God is telling us is that his word is sufficient. His

621
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,420
word is sufficient. Let me say it this way, because he's dealing with compromise,

622
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,180
he's dealing with the the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,

623
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:50,460
and there's this idea that there is something that I might gain through

624
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,860
compromise. But can I tell you that you're not going to gain anything

625
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:01,620
through compromise. God's word is sufficient, and God has given to us his

626
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,900
word, and we must follow what he's given to us. We must take the truth that he's

627
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:16,060
provided to us, and we must stand on the truth, and we must live the truth. I don't

628
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:22,660
need, I am not going to gain anything through compromise, and neither will you.

629
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:31,260
I think the result of compromise in most cases would be regret, would be

630
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,300
regret. Because you know when you compromise, it doesn't take too long

631
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,020
before you start seeing the fruit of the compromise. When we begin to see the

632
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,260
fruit of the compromise, that's when the regret sets in. So this evening he says

633
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,020
to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna. Notice this, and

634
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:59,180
we'll give him a white stone. It's kind of interesting, and there's not any clear

635
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:05,020
100% dogmatic kind of position here, but I believe that this white stone, you look

636
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:09,660
at some historical things, and there's really a number of ideas with regard to

637
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,740
the significance of a white stone. But I think what really makes the most sense

638
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,020
as you look here, and you see what the Lord is saying, is it would represent

639
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:25,180
pardon and forgiveness. Oftentimes someone that was acquitted of a crime in

640
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,260
this era, they would be given a white stone to show that they were pardoned.

641
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,540
I'm thankful this morning, this evening, excuse me, that I have been

642
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:40,220
pardoned. I've been forgiven. Think about the truth of being forgiven. I'm

643
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:49,140
forgiven forever. I don't have the guilt, the weight of that guilt of my sin. Why?

644
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,420
Because I've been forgiven. And if you've been forgiven this evening, you

645
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,700
understand as well the significance of that, and what a blessing it is. And he

646
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:04,140
says that I'll give him a white stone. But then he says this, and in the

647
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:13,820
stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. I

648
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,220
know that we sing that song, there's a new name written down in glory, and it's

649
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,580
mine, oh yes it's mine. We begin to look at this phraseology and thinking about

650
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,980
that white stone representing pardon and forgiveness, but then also noticing where

651
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,500
the Bible says that, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth,

652
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,060
saving he that receiveth it. You know that in some parts of the world, even

653
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,260
still today, but certainly throughout history, when someone came to Christ, they

654
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,300
would literally change their name. And it still happens today, especially in

655
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:56,540
some countries of certain religious, world religions, where they have names

656
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,020
that are associated very closely with their particular world religion. They

657
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:06,940
come to Christ and they'll change their name. Why? Because it's a new identity.

658
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,180
Begin to think about this, and of course in our culture, most of us would not ever

659
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,860
consider having a change of name because of coming to Christ, but the

660
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:24,020
reality is that we do have a new name. I now belong to Jesus. God is now my

661
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,180
Father. Amen? But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons

662
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,380
of God. Listen, I've been adopted into the family of God. Aren't you thankful for

663
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,540
the truth of adoption? Now here's something that's amazing. I've never gone

664
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,660
through the process of adoption personally, but I know people that have

665
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,100
personally. You know what happens after they go through the process of adoption?

666
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:57,620
There comes a day. You know what happens in that day? They get a new name. Yeah? They

667
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,620
get a new name. And I know some folks that

668
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,020
that the process is lengthy.

669
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,840
And unfortunately in America today,

670
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,400
the process is expensive, that process of adoption.

671
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,620
But I know folks, relatives and a close pastor friend,

672
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,020
even here in Virginia,

673
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,340
that have gone through this process of adoption

674
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,780
and they get so excited about that day

675
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,340
that they'll go to the courthouse

676
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,020
and everything will be made official

677
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,300
because there's this lengthy period of time.

678
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,740
And yes, we've had our daughter in our home

679
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,620
for however long we have,

680
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,140
but now it's the day that it's gonna be official

681
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,080
and the name has changed.

682
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,920
To what name?

683
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,780
Well, to the name of the parents,

684
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,220
the new parents, the adopted parents.

685
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,020
And I think about the truth that God gives us in his word

686
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,660
when he talks about being adopted in the family of God.

687
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,920
He's given us a new name, a new identity.

688
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,240
I think this evening about the wonderful truth

689
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,240
that as believers, as Christians,

690
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,520
our identity is in Christ.

691
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,540
Our identity is in Christ.

692
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,320
Yes, we can talk about our family name.

693
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,600
Yes, we can talk about our citizenship

694
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
and so on and so forth.

695
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,420
But the reality is that first,

696
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,740
the primary identity for each child of God

697
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,620
is that I'm a Christian.

698
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,120
I belong to Christ.

699
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,700
And he says,

700
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,300
not only will I give him to eat of the hidden manna,

701
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,580
I'll give him a white stone

702
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,180
and then the stone a name written,

703
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,380
which no man knoweth,

704
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,580
saving he that receiveth it.

705
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,260
I wonder if you remember when you first got saved

706
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,980
and maybe somebody said something like this to you,

707
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,840
now you're a Christian.

708
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,380
Now you're a Christian.

709
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,420
And I don't know if that was said to you

710
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,660
or what significance it would have had immediately.

711
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,180
But as you look back and you begin to understand that,

712
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,740
it's significant.

713
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,380
I'm a Christian.

714
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,180
What does it mean to be a Christian?

715
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,220
We use the word in the New Testament, saint.

716
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,280
One who is in Christ and whom Christ dwells.

717
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,880
Wow, it's amazing.

718
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,640
I remember when my dad got saved.

719
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,040
Here's what some of the people said.

720
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,640
Well, Chris got religion, it will wear off.

721
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,480
No, he got a new name.

722
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,080
He got saved, he got born again.

723
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
And you know what?

724
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,480
Other people may not have understood

725
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,280
that new name Christian, but he understood.

726
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,520
And tonight, when we acknowledge the fact

727
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,640
that we've been saved by the grace of God

728
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,960
and we've been pardoned and we have forgiveness

729
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,320
and we have a new name that's written,

730
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,480
that I am a Christian and the world may not understand that.

731
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,880
The world might think, oh, that just means you're religious.

732
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,080
No, it doesn't mean I'm religious.

733
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,760
I told a man I was knocking on his door

734
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,680
and he answered the door.

735
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,040
I think Tim, maybe Ronnie was with me knocking door.

736
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,880
And he said, oh, I don't like religion.

737
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,520
I said, neither do I.

738
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,400
And he looked at me like I was crazy

739
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,440
because I had just announced

740
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,520
that I was from Fellowship Baptist Church.

741
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,800
I don't like religion, why?

742
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,680
Because religion condemns.

743
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,960
It's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ

744
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,680
that gives life and purpose.

745
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,840
And we understand it tonight,

746
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,040
but notice it says, which no man knoweth saving he

747
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,880
that receiveth it.

748
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,720
You try to explain to lost relatives and lost coworkers

749
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,960
what Christ did for you and they don't get it

750
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,920
because they don't have it.

751
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,000
Does that make sense?

752
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,640
And we get it because we have it.

753
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,680
And we can rejoice tonight.

754
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,440
Listen, the church in Pergamos, they were doing some things.

755
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
They were a light in a dark place.

756
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,600
They were faithful.

757
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,560
But there was some compromise that was creeping in.

758
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,160
There was some corruption that was coming in.

759
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,480
And Jesus says, hey, listen, repent.

760
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,800
It's there.

761
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,720
I know it.

762
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
I see it.

763
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,440
I'm telling you, there are some that are there

764
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,520
that hold the doctrine of Balaam

765
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,360
and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

766
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,160
And if you don't repent, I'm gonna come and judge.

767
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,440
This evening, as we evaluate the church in Pergamos,

768
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
we can take this admonition in charge

769
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,440
and we can say, hey, listen, we need to keep on doing right

770
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,520
and we need to know the principles of God's word

771
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,940
so that we can resist and avoid compromise

772
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,000
so that we can continue to have the blessing of God

773
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,680
upon our lives individually, in our families

774
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,100
and in our church so that God would be glorified.

775
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,940
Let's pray.

776
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,760
Father, we love you.

777
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,600
We thank you for loving us.

778
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,120
Thank you for your word.

779
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,120
I thank you for this letter, the church in Pergamos.

780
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,480
I thank you, God, for what you have revealed

781
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,560
to us through it.

782
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,760
And I pray that you'd help us to take heed.

783
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,320
I pray that tonight, Lord, you would help us

784
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,600
to evaluate and examine our own lives

785
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,440
in light of this letter to the church in Pergamos.

786
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,000
Lord, help us as we acknowledge tonight

787
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,280
that the temptation for compromise will always exist,

788
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,960
but God, help us to stay true to you and to your word.

789
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,560
Help us, Lord, to resist and avoid compromise

790
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,320
so that we might continue to have the blessing of God

791
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,360
upon our lives.

792
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,820
Well, thank you for every decision made

793
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,280
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
