00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
Revelation chapter number 2, be looking at verses 12 through 17 as we deal with the church

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380
in Pergamos.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.880
And we'll be looking here at these few verses of scripture.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.720
The city of Pergamos was located about 45 miles north of Smyrna.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.840
Of course, it's been a few weeks since we've been here on a Sunday night looking at the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.840
book of Revelation.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.760
We've had a couple of other evenings and different things going on on Sunday nights, but it's

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.280
been almost a month actually since we've been in the book of Revelation.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.680
And so the last study was on the church in Smyrna, verses 8 through 11, and this city

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
of Pergamos is located at 45 miles or so north of Smyrna.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.439
The city was known for pagan polytheistic religion, including emperor worship.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:51.000
And so it was a real exciting place to live.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.080
All sorts of idolatry and wickedness and lots of religion, quote unquote.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:06.919
Of course, no true, the lack of true gospel preaching was limited.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:12.120
Obviously the church in Pergamos is there, but there's much false teaching, false religion

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.519
and all that was going on.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:19.879
The city was known, it's believed that parchment type paper was first used here in the city

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.879
of Pergamos.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.080
That's just kind of an interesting thought or fact.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.160
It's also reported, if you were to study through history, that this city had a library

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.519
quite extensive that had about 200,000 volumes.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:35.440
And so we're going to think about this as in the first century, we're going to think

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.279
about a library with 200,000 volumes.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.120
It's pretty significant.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.839
And so we find that as we look at this text of scripture, we see a little bit about what's

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:47.559
going on in the city and what they would be aware of.

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:50.800
But we understand as we're looking at the book of Revelation and these letters that

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.319
are written to the churches, the idea is not so much to study the cities and know too

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.000
many things about them specifically, but to look at the evaluation that God gives of the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
individual churches.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.800
It's his church and he loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.320
He purchased it with his own blood according to Acts chapter 20.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.699
And we find that he is the head of the church and he's writing, having John write these

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.300
letters to the church as he's giving an evaluation.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.899
And we know immediately as we have with the previous two letters, how the Lord is described

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:31.899
for us.

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:37.160
We noticed in the first letter to the church at Ephesus that it talked about the Lord Jesus

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.419
Christ, that he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.259
of the seven golden candlesticks.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:51.619
And then to Smyrna, these things saith the first and the last, which was dead and is

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:52.619
alive.

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:57.820
But notice now in verse number 12, the Bible says, and to the angel of the church in Pergamos

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.419
write, these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.820
We mentioned in chapter number one, as we looked at the great description that is given

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.240
of the Lord Jesus Christ, about the fact that he's described in so many amazing ways

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.979
and understanding that he has a name, the word of God.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.940
We looked at Revelation 19 and we looked at a number of those things.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.300
And now we find that it says, he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.020
Immediately my mind goes to Hebrews chapter four and verse number 12.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.119
If you want to just very quickly look at that verse of scripture and notice what the Bible

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:42.160
says in Hebrews 4 and verse number 12, as we consider this introductory statement.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.520
And here in Hebrews 4 and verse 12, the Bible says this, for the word of God is quick.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.600
It means it's alive.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.759
I'm thankful that God's word is a living book.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:04:00.240
The Bible says, for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.600
sword.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.800
And notice it says, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.740
and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.040
That's a powerful verse of scripture.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.279
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's having John pen this letter to the church

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:29.119
in Pergamos, he says, he which hath the sharp sword with two edges.

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:30.119
It's not dull.

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:31.119
It's sharp.

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.480
The word of God is quick.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
It's powerful.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.399
It's a living book.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:42.760
And the Lord Jesus Christ has a name according to Revelation 19, the word of God.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.079
And so we look here and begin to look at this evaluation of the church.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:49.760
I want you to note number one, how they flourished.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.320
Notice as we look at that familiar statement, I know thy works.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.959
We've read that of the church at Ephesus.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.959
We've read of the church in Smyrna.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.160
We'll read it in each of the churches.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.480
And we see here that in verse number 13, the Lord says, I know thy works.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.480
You understand this evening that there's nothing that you can hide from God.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.119
There's absolutely nothing that you can hide from God.

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:13.559
Adam and Eve tried to hide from God.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.160
How'd that work for them?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.720
It didn't work.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.239
David tried to hide some stuff from God.

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:19.239
How'd that work?

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:20.959
Well, he told Nathan all about it.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.679
And Nathan stood before David and said, thou art the man, right?

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:29.880
And we can go on and on and we can understand this evening that God knows everything.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.119
Listen, he knows your motives.

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:37.480
He knows the thoughts that you have, that he knows everything about us.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.720
He knows our works.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.799
He knows why we do the things that we do.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:48.540
And it says here, I know thy works and where thou dwellest.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:57.540
That's how he describes the place Pergamos, even where Satan's seat is.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.859
And thou notice, as we look at this verse of scripture and look at how they flourished,

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:10.660
it says, and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.380
Even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you, where

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500
Satan dwelleth.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.579
As we look at verse 13 and begin to think about how they flourished, I want you to consider

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:28.339
a few thoughts here with regard to the church in Pergamos and what they were doing and how

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.779
they were being used of the Lord.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.079
Number one, they were a light in a dark place.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.540
They were a light in a dark place.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.339
It says that where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.940
Sometimes we can get sideways over the place where God has us, maybe being a wicked place,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.899
an ungodly place, but the reality is that God has put us in this world, though we're

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:57.820
not of the world, and he's called us to be a light.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.619
The book of Philippians in chapter two and verse number 15, the Bible says that you may

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:06.480
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.540
perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.619
Jesus said that we're to let our light shine.

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.899
We understand, we sing the song with the kids, this little light of mine, I'm gonna

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.540
let it shine.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.179
I'm not gonna let Satan blow it out, I'm not gonna hide it in a bushel, no, I'm gonna let

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:28.940
it shine till Jesus comes, and we sing all those verses with the little kids and we understand

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.859
the importance of being that light.

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:39.779
And here, the church in Pergamos, they were living in a wicked, pagan, idolatrous, polytheistic

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:45.320
society, and yet they were shining as a light.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.760
What a great example for us, what a great reminder of the importance to continue to

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.519
shine the light of the gospel.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.059
We find that not only were they a light in a dark place, but the Bible says that they

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:07.920
held fast his name, notice it says, and thou holdest fast my name.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.540
I'm thankful that even in the midst of a pagan society, even in the midst of idolatrous

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.320
worship that we can hold fast the name of Jesus.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.200
Jesus indeed is the sweetest name I know, and we ought to lift high the name of the

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.000
Lord Jesus Christ, we ought to not be ashamed of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.500
He's my savior, and I love him, and he says to this church that thou holdest fast my name,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.799
verse number three, and hast not denied my faith.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.820
Can you understand just for a moment as we begin to think about this church in Pergamos

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:52.460
and the city and the idolatry and the wickedness and the emperor worship and how if you did

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:58.700
not follow their religious practices, they would literally make your life miserable.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.299
They would try to make it so that you cannot survive.

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:08.380
Not so that you cannot thrive, but literally so that you cannot even survive.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.219
You must follow their rules.

00:09:10.219 --> 00:09:16.979
You must do as they tell you to do, and yet we find that this church, they did not deny

00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:18.979
the faith.

00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:21.219
They did not deny the faith.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:24.840
Can you imagine the pressures?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:31.179
The overwhelming pressures that they would face in society, but yet we find that here

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:35.979
the Lord Jesus Christ, as he's giving this evaluation, he says that you're shining in

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:42.059
this dark place, that you're holding fast my name, that you've not denied my faith,

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:51.559
and then notice he says, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:56.020
was slain among you where Satan dwelleth.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.020
It's interesting that he said at the beginning of the verse, even where Satan's...

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.100
C is, and at the end, where Satan dwelleth.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.220
But he talks about this fact that they were faithful

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.460
in the midst of great persecution.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.180
He says in those days, can you imagine

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.360
the church in Pergamos?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.740
I mean, they obviously knew the events

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.880
surrounding the death of Antipas.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.420
They would be familiar with all that had transpired,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.220
and as the Lord says that even in those days

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.700
where in Antipas, my faithful martyr

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.300
who was slain among you,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.660
could it be that some within the church,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.260
not only brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.360
but perhaps even family members,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.380
they're being reminded of being faithful unto death,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.900
being faithful unto death.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.220
And here the church was flourishing in these ways,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.220
and we can rejoice in that, and we can take note,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.620
and we can say, okay, God knows our works,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.100
and it's good that God would acknowledge

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.500
and God would recognize that here's some things,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.800
here's some areas where you're doing

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.180
what you're supposed to be doing,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.500
but we understand as we continue through the text,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.340
not only how they flourished, but number two,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.700
we know how they faltered.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.700
We see in verse 14 and 15 in these two verses,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.580
and in verse number 14 specifically,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.980
notice the Bible begins,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.180
but I have a few things against thee.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.180
These are words that are no doubt difficult to receive.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.040
These are words that given an evaluation,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.060
you do not wanna hear.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.260
I have a few things against thee.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.460
Remember as we looked at the church in Ephesus,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.460
the Bible said, nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.900
because thou hast left thy first love.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.560
And we find here that he says,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.540
but I have a few things against thee.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.500
Notice what he mentioned specifically.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.100
The first thing that he mentioned specifically

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.580
is the doctrine of Balaam.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.260
It says this in verse number 14,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.860
because thou hast there them that hold

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.440
the doctrine of Balaam,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.540
who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.900
before the children of Israel

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.700
to eat things sacrificed unto idols

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.540
and to commit fornication.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.500
Now it's kind of interesting

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.140
because here in Revelation chapter two

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.140
in verse number 14,

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.620
it refers to this situation

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.260
as being the doctrine of Balaam.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.120
In second Peter chapter two in verse number 15,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.660
the Bible refers to it as being the way of Balaam.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.500
And in Jude verse number 11,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.440
the Bible refers to it as being the error of Balaam.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.880
But here we find that God refers to this teaching,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.660
this doctrine, and he refers to it

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.740
as being the doctrine of Balaam.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.940
And there were some there that held,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.320
it says that thou hast there

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.900
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.620
So if we find that Jesus is referencing

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.100
to this church in Revelation,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.720
this church in Pergamos about this doctrine of Balaam,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.700
we ought to know what that is.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.780
Begin to read about that in Numbers chapter 22 through 25.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.660
We won't read all of that obviously,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.800
but turn back if you will to Numbers chapter 25.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.820
Numbers chapter 25, and I want you to notice some things.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.460
In beginning in chapter 22,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.280
we won't have time to go through it,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.900
but we find that Balaam is called

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.220
in order to curse the people of God.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.620
We find that he blesses the people of God,

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.140
he does not curse them.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.940
And there's some very important things

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.700
that we learn through that process.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.640
But we come to chapter 25,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.960
and it's here in chapter 25

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.400
that God tells us what the children of Israel did.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.220
And then it's not until chapter 31

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.320
that the Bible gives us the reason

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.160
by which they did what they did in chapter 25.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.000
So we're gonna read in chapter 25

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.760
what the children of Israel did,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.240
then we're gonna go over to chapter 31

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.600
and understand the counsel that Balaam gave.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.280
In chapter 25, in verse number one,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.100
the Bible says,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.360
and Israel abode in Shittim,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.960
and the people began to commit whoredom

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.280
with the daughters of Moab.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.760
And they called the people

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.720
unto the sacrifice of their gods,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.420
and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.040
And Israel joined himself unto Baal Peor,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.040
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.440
Now those are interesting verses of scripture

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.120
when you're reading through the dialogue

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.960
and you're reading about Balaam being called by Balak

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.560
to curse the people of God,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.840
and he cannot curse them, and he blesses them,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.520
and Balak is beside himself.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.600
And you go through chapter 22 and 23 and 24,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.860
and you're reading all of these iterations

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.880
of what's going on,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.720
and you're reading even in chapter 24,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.560
in verse number 10,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.800
it says that Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.640
Why?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.720
Because this was not what he brought them here for.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.560
And then all of a sudden,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.040
you start reading chapter 25,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.900
and you say, what happened?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.440
What is going on?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.860
How is it that they committed whoredom

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.080
with the daughters of Moab?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.400
How is it that they're eating the sacrifice of their gods,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.900
and they ate, and they're bowing down to their gods?

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.340
What in the world?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.860
And you look at chapter 31,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.120
and God gives us insight here in verses 15 and 16

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.640
with regard to the counsel of Balaam.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840
And notice what the Bible says

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.880
in numbers 31 in verse 15,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.240
"'And Moses said unto them,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.640
"'Have you saved all the women alive?

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.040
"'Behold, these caused the children of Israel,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.260
"'through the counsel of Balaam,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.460
"'to commit trespass against the Lord

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.800
"'in the matter of Peor.'"

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.560
And there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.520
In verse 16 of numbers 31,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.920
it's referring to that event that we just read

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.640
in chapter 25, verses one through three.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.920
And we find that God reveals to us

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.220
that it was through the counsel of Balaam.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.680
Let me share something with you

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.680
that I think is vitally important

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.680
that we understand this evening.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.580
You understand tonight that the enemy, our enemy,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.700
he cannot curse us.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.180
God has blessed us.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.120
We are blessed.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.300
We are the people of God.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.340
We are the children of God.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.960
He cannot curse us.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.260
But you know what he can do?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.460
He can do the same thing that Balaam did

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.060
in giving this counsel.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.660
Since the enemy cannot curse the people of God,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.280
he sought to corrupt the people of God through compromise.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.940
And here's what happens.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.860
Because of the corruption and the compromise,

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.380
the curse comes.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.260
Because of the compromise and the corruption,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.780
the curse comes.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.440
Balaam could not curse the people of God.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.280
Why?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.420
Because they had been blessed by God.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.320
But he gives them counsel to do something

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.860
that was in violation to God's law

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.200
that would bring forth the judgment of God.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.060
Do you get that tonight?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.720
He could not curse them.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.180
What did Balaam want?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.500
Balaam wanted them to be destroyed.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.920
Balaam says, I can't do it because God's blessed them.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.060
But you know what?

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.940
If you corrupt them,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.300
because notice what the Bible says at the end

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.860
of verse number three in chapter 25,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.780
the Lord was kindled,

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.460
the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.620
Why was God's anger kindled against his people?

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.900
Because they corrupted themselves.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.220
Because they violated the truth of God's word.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.000
You know, no one can make you sin.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.500
But when you sin, you forfeit the blessing of God.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.860
And you deal with judgment.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.980
And so there's this doctrine of Balaam

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.240
that's going on here in the church in Pergamos.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.360
There were some that held to this doctrine of Balaam.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.520
And it all has to do with compromise and corruption.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.980
And as we look at the connection between verse 14 and 15,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.440
we see what's happening here in Pergamos

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.020
as we begin to understand how they began to falter.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.119
And there's compromise and there's corruption

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:49.980
because not only the doctrine of Balaam,

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.980
but in verse 15 of Revelation two, the Bible says,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.260
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.520
of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.619
Now, in the city of Ephesus,

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:10.460
according to chapter two in verse number six

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.580
here in Revelation,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.880
we read of the deeds of the Nicolaitans.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.580
But now we're reading of the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.260
And I understand that it's a different city,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.400
it's a different place.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.600
But I want to remind you of the biblical truth

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.040
from Galatians five, nine,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.679
that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:35.600
You know, sin is a slippery slope and so is compromise.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.600
You begin to just compromise a little bit here

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.520
and a little bit there,

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.480
and you change and blur the line here and there.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.600
And before long, it just kind of spirals out of control.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.340
Compromise is a dangerous thing.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.200
And so we find as we begin to think about

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.200
this sect, if you will,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.040
that were referred to as the Nicolaitans,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.320
it's believed that this was a sect of individuals there

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.160
that advocated.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.540
for this thought of what we refer to as antinomianism.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.040
This idea of antinomianism is really this idea

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.880
that we have a license to live however we wanna live.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.160
That we're saved by grace

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.200
and therefore we can just do whatever.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.900
I mean, forget about the standards.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.720
Not only do we lower the standards,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.380
but man, we should just eliminate the standards altogether.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.040
But I wanna remind you what Paul said in Romans chapter six.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.120
He said, should we sin that grace may abound?

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.480
What's the answer?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.760
God forbid.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.440
Is that not what Paul says

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.980
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.600
in Romans chapter six?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.200
And so we find that here when we look at this situation

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.760
of the faltering church in Pergamos

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.440
and we find that they were flourishing.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.680
I mean, they did some things good,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.960
but there were some people within the church.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.160
There were some in verse number 14,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.880
because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.120
in verse number 15,

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.720
so has now also them that hold

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.360
the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.000
And so there were some within the congregation,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.540
not all of them,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600
but there were some within the congregation

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.620
that were holding to this doctrine of Balaam,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.000
that were holding to this doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.760
And can I share with you this evening

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.560
that they don't just hold it to themselves,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.240
they begin to influence other people.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.720
They begin to peddle their doctrine.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.880
They begin to try to find others to share this with.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.920
And we find that as we're looking at this church

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.200
in Pergamos and we're looking at what's happening,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.480
that we have to be so careful

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.820
when it comes to this idea of compromise.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.480
It's absolutely imperative that we resist compromise.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.220
It doesn't mean that we do not seek to do various things

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.520
just because maybe something's new or whatever it may be,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.280
but the reality is that we do not wanna forfeit

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.820
the blessing of God in order to appease

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.280
some group of people.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.240
And as we look here at this text of scripture

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.880
and begin to think about where they were located,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.640
and then even beginning to try to make some application

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.920
for us this evening,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.000
we understand that the temptation

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.260
will always exist to compromise.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.800
The temptation will always exist to compromise.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.560
I have followed up with visitors

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.640
that have come to our church over the years.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.320
I've been here for 13 and a half years.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.560
I've followed up with countless visitors.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.780
And there's been some visitors that I've gone to

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.840
and we've sat with and we visited with,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.480
and they say, well, if you just change that position

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.960
on the King James Bible, we'd come back to your church.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.880
Sorry, we're not gonna change our position

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.500
on the King James Bible so that you would come

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.340
to our church.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.740
If you just get some different music,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.140
if you just do this, if you just do that,

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.980
the reality is that there's always a temptation

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.860
to compromise.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.760
And here's what happens, it can almost become pragmatic

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.780
where we get that idea that, well, if we do this,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.300
if we just kind of lower this,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.900
if we change this a little bit,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.140
then we'll be able to reach more people.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.020
And so we wanna reach more people,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.620
and so therefore we're going to falter on this area here

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.300
because we wanna reach more people.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.300
And there's always a temptation to compromise.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.380
It always exists.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.780
It exists in your home.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.860
It exists with your family.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.060
It exists with your children.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.060
There's always a temptation to compromise.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.140
How do we resist compromise?

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.320
How do we avoid compromise?

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.120
Not that we just wanna stay in some era

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.880
of we're just not willing to be up with the times

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.720
or whatever it may be.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.440
No, we don't wanna compromise.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.880
There's a difference.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.640
I'll use the word relevant.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.460
I use it appropriately this evening.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.720
There's a difference between being relevant

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.040
and compromising.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.080
We put electricity in our building

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.000
because it's actually kind of comfortable.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.960
It's not really a compromise.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.440
By the way, that was done well before any of us were here,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.120
but I'm thankful that it was done, aren't you?

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.360
Come on.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.620
I'm thankful for indoor plumbing, right?

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.460
Aren't you?

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.520
Especially on a night like tonight.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.560
You gotta, yeah, come on.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.320
I mean, just be, that's not the same as compromise.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.900
So how do we resist it?

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.280
How do we avoid it as a church, as a family?

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.580
What do we do?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.380
We have to know the truth of God's word.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.900
And we have to be students of the word of God.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.800
We have to commit ourselves to following the principles

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.540
that are contained within God's word.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.320
Here's what God's word says,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.840
and here's how we're gonna go.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.260
And here's the reality is that you'll be pushed

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.020
and I'll be pushed.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.980
And there are times in which we look to the truth

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.340
of God's word and we desire that we want to stay true

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.020
to God's word.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.860
We make that commitment that I wanna be true

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.540
to the principles that God has laid forth in his word,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.740
and we wanna follow the way of the Lord.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.400
But there's always gonna be a temptation to compromise.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.300
In a city like Pergamos, with all that was going on

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.860
and all the pressures that a church would face

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.620
and all of the tribulation that they were dealing with,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.060
the persecution that they were facing,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.220
I think it could kind of be easy to be like,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.300
yeah, let's just kind of bend a little bit right here.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:56.120
Let's just kind of, but no, we don't wanna do that.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.980
And here the Lord says, I have a few things against thee.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.480
Why?

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.540
Well, because there are some that have,

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.500
they hold to the doctrine of Balaam.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.300
There are some there that hold the doctrine

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.300
of the Nicolaitans.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.060
And so he gives, as he's evaluating the church,

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.640
and even as we've mentioned for our own church this evening,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.100
though Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.500
is not in Revelation two or three,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.460
we take these passages of scripture and we say,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.720
what would God say of us?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.760
How would God evaluate us?

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.200
Well, in each of the churches that God corrects,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.680
he also gives them counsel

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.240
to be able to correct their course.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.040
I've termed it this way, number three tonight,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.040
the formula for revival, the formula for revival.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.440
The Lord exposes our failures,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.200
those areas where we're faltering

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.560
as we see in verse 14 and 15.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.000
So that we would address it, so that we deal with it.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.560
See, because we can deceive ourselves.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.200
We can sit back and say, man, everything's going great.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.400
But no, the Lord steps in and he gives an evaluation.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.400
He provides the truth with regard to where we stand.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.320
And then he provides the formula for revival.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.400
Notice in one word in verse 16, repent.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.960
Repent.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.400
You know what every church

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.600
and what every believer needs to do is agree with God.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.240
To agree with God.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.400
We're not gonna argue with God.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.300
We're not gonna say, no, that's not how it is.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.720
No, that's not true.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.720
That's a bad evaluation.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.000
No, God's way is true and God's word is true.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.800
And what God says is fact.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.000
And he says, repent.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.740
You must change your mind,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.960
which will result in a change of direction.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.920
You must return to the Lord's way and refuse compromise.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.520
There's no middle ground here.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.720
It's repent.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.540
It's repent.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.820
God's way is always right.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.680
100% of the time.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.240
God's way is perfect.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.520
And so what we must do is align our thinking

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.020
with God's thinking.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.000
The pragmatic approach says, but we're trying,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.880
look, we're trying to reach more people

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.280
or we're trying to do this or we're trying to do that.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.800
And God says, repent.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.080
Do God's work God's way.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.380
No compromise.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.440
Notice the or else in verse number 16.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.440
He says, repent or else I will come unto thee quickly

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.440
and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.360
You think God is serious about his church?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.320
I believe he is.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.760
He loved the church and he gave himself for it.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.680
The church is the bride of Christ.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.820
The church is the greatest organism.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.840
I like to use that word, not organization

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.540
because it's living.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.580
The church is the greatest organism on the planet earth.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.820
It's the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.220
And the Lord Jesus Christ is serious.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.180
And he says, repent.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.940
And if not, or else I will,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.760
notice he says, I will come unto thee quickly.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.900
God will give us a little space to repent.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.980
I'm thankful for God's grace and his mercy

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.240
and his long suffering.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.060
But he says, here's the evaluation.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.120
Change your way.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.780
He doesn't say, here's the evaluation

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.580
and we'll come back in a year and reevaluate.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.620
No.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:09.420
here's the evaluation, repent, get it straight, get it right. And he says this

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:14.140
or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:22.460
sword of my mouth. I begin to think about that. So often we rejoice in the

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.260
promises that God gives, if God be for us who can be against us. Aren't you

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:33.580
thankful for that wonderful promise? But I'm reminded this evening that as

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:39.140
Jeremiah was prophesying to the people of Judah and they send and they say

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.580
will God fight for us? He says no, God's gonna fight against us. Why was God

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:49.820
gonna fight against his own people? Because of their disobedience, their sin,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:56.580
their idolatry. And I don't want to be in a place where where it would be that

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:02.940
God would fight against with the sword of his mouth. Those people, those groups

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.300
that were in the church that held to the doctrine of Balaam, to the doctrine of

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:13.260
the Nicolaitans, they had to be dealt with. It had to be addressed. There needed

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:19.700
to be repentance. These letters that God gives to these churches, they're serious.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:30.380
Why? Because God's church is precious and God is concerned about the holiness of

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:39.020
his people and the holiness of his church. The church is not a club. It's the body of

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:49.060
Christ and we're to follow God's way. And the Bible says in verse 17 as we

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.060
end each of these letters in the similar fashion, the consistency in each

00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:04.060
of them, I know thy works. But also as we read in verse 17, he that hath an ear, let

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:11.940
him hear what the Spirit saith unto, remember, the churches, plural. I believe

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.060
that these seven churches that are addressed, this letter would go and they

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.940
would read not only their own evaluation, but they would read the evaluations of

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.820
the others. Why? Because he that hath an ear, let him hear. Listen, I can learn

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.220
from the evaluation that God gives us, but we can learn from the evaluation that God

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.420
gives another church. And here, as we have Revelation 2 and 3, there are seven

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.300
churches that we can learn from. And God has preserved it for all of church history

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.860
so that we could have these letters, so that we could learn the lessons that we

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.620
need to learn, that we could be aware of the danger of compromise, that we could

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.460
understand how that the enemy wants us to corrupt, he wants us to disobey so that

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.980
we would be judged, so that we would lose the good hand of God's favor in our

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:11.100
lives, in our ministry. And he says this, to him that overcometh. I've mentioned in

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:17.500
the previous lessons, as we look at that phrase in these particular letters, that

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:23.300
that's the one that is victorious. I'm thankful even for the truth, and we sang

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.940
about this the other night in 1 John chapter number 5, where the Bible says in

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.100
verse number 4, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:39.020
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. I'm thankful that we are more

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.340
than conquerors through Christ. I'm thankful that we are on the winning side,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:49.140
that we're victorious. But we understand that as we look here at this thought of

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.660
being victorious and dealing with the instruction, the counsel that God has

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.740
given, that he provides here. Remember to the church in Smyrna, he said, he that

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.420
overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death. What a blessing to know that I'm

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.700
saved by the grace of God. I'm on, I'm born again, I'm on the winning side, and

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.820
the second death hath no power over me, according to Revelation 20. But here I

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:19.060
want you to notice that God says three things to the one that's victorious, that

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:26.100
overcomes. It says that I will give to eat of the hidden manna, of the hidden

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.540
manna. It's kind of interesting phraseology. We're familiar with manna in

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:36.740
the Old Testament. We're familiar with how God miraculously sent bread from

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:43.260
heaven to feed his people, and how if they took up too much on a particular

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.540
day, that it would breed worms, and it would stink, and it would spoil. But then

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.940
on a particular day, because they would not go out on the Sabbath, they would

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:59.660
have to gather twice as much. And even in so doing, it did not spoil, it did not

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:06.540
rot, it did not stink, did not breed worms. And so we're familiar with the manna of

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:12.340
that God sent from heaven to feed his people, but now we look here and the

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:18.740
Bible says that I will give to eat of the hidden manna. I believe that

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:25.260
God is referring here to the spiritual provision through his word. Let me say it

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:32.300
this way, I believe what God is telling us is that his word is sufficient. His

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.420
word is sufficient. Let me say it this way, because he's dealing with compromise,

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:43.180
he's dealing with the the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:50.460
and there's this idea that there is something that I might gain through

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.860
compromise. But can I tell you that you're not going to gain anything

00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:01.620
through compromise. God's word is sufficient, and God has given to us his

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:07.900
word, and we must follow what he's given to us. We must take the truth that he's

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:16.060
provided to us, and we must stand on the truth, and we must live the truth. I don't

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:22.660
need, I am not going to gain anything through compromise, and neither will you.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:31.260
I think the result of compromise in most cases would be regret, would be

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.300
regret. Because you know when you compromise, it doesn't take too long

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:42.020
before you start seeing the fruit of the compromise. When we begin to see the

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:48.260
fruit of the compromise, that's when the regret sets in. So this evening he says

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.020
to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna. Notice this, and

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:59.180
we'll give him a white stone. It's kind of interesting, and there's not any clear

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:05.020
100% dogmatic kind of position here, but I believe that this white stone, you look

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.660
at some historical things, and there's really a number of ideas with regard to

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.740
the significance of a white stone. But I think what really makes the most sense

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:19.020
as you look here, and you see what the Lord is saying, is it would represent

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:25.180
pardon and forgiveness. Oftentimes someone that was acquitted of a crime in

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:29.260
this era, they would be given a white stone to show that they were pardoned.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:34.540
I'm thankful this morning, this evening, excuse me, that I have been

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:40.220
pardoned. I've been forgiven. Think about the truth of being forgiven. I'm

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:49.140
forgiven forever. I don't have the guilt, the weight of that guilt of my sin. Why?

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.420
Because I've been forgiven. And if you've been forgiven this evening, you

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.700
understand as well the significance of that, and what a blessing it is. And he

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:04.140
says that I'll give him a white stone. But then he says this, and in the

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:13.820
stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. I

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.220
know that we sing that song, there's a new name written down in glory, and it's

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.580
mine, oh yes it's mine. We begin to look at this phraseology and thinking about

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.980
that white stone representing pardon and forgiveness, but then also noticing where

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:34.500
the Bible says that, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth,

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.060
saving he that receiveth it. You know that in some parts of the world, even

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:44.260
still today, but certainly throughout history, when someone came to Christ, they

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.300
would literally change their name. And it still happens today, especially in

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:56.540
some countries of certain religious, world religions, where they have names

00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.020
that are associated very closely with their particular world religion. They

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:06.940
come to Christ and they'll change their name. Why? Because it's a new identity.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:12.180
Begin to think about this, and of course in our culture, most of us would not ever

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.860
consider having a change of name because of coming to Christ, but the

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:24.020
reality is that we do have a new name. I now belong to Jesus. God is now my

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:29.180
Father. Amen? But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.380
of God. Listen, I've been adopted into the family of God. Aren't you thankful for

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:39.540
the truth of adoption? Now here's something that's amazing. I've never gone

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.660
through the process of adoption personally, but I know people that have

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.100
personally. You know what happens after they go through the process of adoption?

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:57.620
There comes a day. You know what happens in that day? They get a new name. Yeah? They

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.620
get a new name. And I know some folks that

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.020
that the process is lengthy.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.840
And unfortunately in America today,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.400
the process is expensive, that process of adoption.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.620
But I know folks, relatives and a close pastor friend,

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.020
even here in Virginia,

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.340
that have gone through this process of adoption

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.780
and they get so excited about that day

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.340
that they'll go to the courthouse

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.020
and everything will be made official

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.300
because there's this lengthy period of time.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.740
And yes, we've had our daughter in our home

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.620
for however long we have,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.140
but now it's the day that it's gonna be official

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.080
and the name has changed.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.920
To what name?

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.780
Well, to the name of the parents,

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.220
the new parents, the adopted parents.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.020
And I think about the truth that God gives us in his word

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.660
when he talks about being adopted in the family of God.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.920
He's given us a new name, a new identity.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.240
I think this evening about the wonderful truth

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.240
that as believers, as Christians,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.520
our identity is in Christ.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.540
Our identity is in Christ.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.320
Yes, we can talk about our family name.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.600
Yes, we can talk about our citizenship

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.800
and so on and so forth.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.420
But the reality is that first,

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.740
the primary identity for each child of God

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.620
is that I'm a Christian.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.120
I belong to Christ.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.700
And he says,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.300
not only will I give him to eat of the hidden manna,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.580
I'll give him a white stone

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.180
and then the stone a name written,

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.380
which no man knoweth,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.580
saving he that receiveth it.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.260
I wonder if you remember when you first got saved

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.980
and maybe somebody said something like this to you,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.840
now you're a Christian.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.380
Now you're a Christian.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.420
And I don't know if that was said to you

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.660
or what significance it would have had immediately.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.180
But as you look back and you begin to understand that,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.740
it's significant.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.380
I'm a Christian.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.180
What does it mean to be a Christian?

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.220
We use the word in the New Testament, saint.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.280
One who is in Christ and whom Christ dwells.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.880
Wow, it's amazing.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.640
I remember when my dad got saved.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.040
Here's what some of the people said.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.640
Well, Chris got religion, it will wear off.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.480
No, he got a new name.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.080
He got saved, he got born again.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080
And you know what?

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.480
Other people may not have understood

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.280
that new name Christian, but he understood.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.520
And tonight, when we acknowledge the fact

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.640
that we've been saved by the grace of God

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.960
and we've been pardoned and we have forgiveness

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.320
and we have a new name that's written,

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.480
that I am a Christian and the world may not understand that.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.880
The world might think, oh, that just means you're religious.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.080
No, it doesn't mean I'm religious.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.760
I told a man I was knocking on his door

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.680
and he answered the door.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.040
I think Tim, maybe Ronnie was with me knocking door.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.880
And he said, oh, I don't like religion.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.520
I said, neither do I.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.400
And he looked at me like I was crazy

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.440
because I had just announced

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.520
that I was from Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.800
I don't like religion, why?

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.680
Because religion condemns.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.960
It's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.680
that gives life and purpose.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.840
And we understand it tonight,

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.040
but notice it says, which no man knoweth saving he

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.880
that receiveth it.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.720
You try to explain to lost relatives and lost coworkers

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.960
what Christ did for you and they don't get it

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.920
because they don't have it.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.000
Does that make sense?

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.640
And we get it because we have it.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.680
And we can rejoice tonight.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.440
Listen, the church in Pergamos, they were doing some things.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.440
They were a light in a dark place.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.600
They were faithful.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.560
But there was some compromise that was creeping in.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.160
There was some corruption that was coming in.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.480
And Jesus says, hey, listen, repent.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.800
It's there.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.720
I know it.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.720
I see it.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.440
I'm telling you, there are some that are there

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.520
that hold the doctrine of Balaam

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.360
and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.160
And if you don't repent, I'm gonna come and judge.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.440
This evening, as we evaluate the church in Pergamos,

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.440
we can take this admonition in charge

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.440
and we can say, hey, listen, we need to keep on doing right

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.520
and we need to know the principles of God's word

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.940
so that we can resist and avoid compromise

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.000
so that we can continue to have the blessing of God

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.680
upon our lives individually, in our families

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.100
and in our church so that God would be glorified.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.940
Let's pray.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.760
Father, we love you.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.600
We thank you for loving us.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.120
Thank you for your word.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.120
I thank you for this letter, the church in Pergamos.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.480
I thank you, God, for what you have revealed

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.560
to us through it.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.760
And I pray that you'd help us to take heed.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.320
I pray that tonight, Lord, you would help us

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.600
to evaluate and examine our own lives

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.440
in light of this letter to the church in Pergamos.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.000
Lord, help us as we acknowledge tonight

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.280
that the temptation for compromise will always exist,

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.960
but God, help us to stay true to you and to your word.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.560
Help us, Lord, to resist and avoid compromise

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.320
so that we might continue to have the blessing of God

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.360
upon our lives.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.820
Well, thank you for every decision made

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.280
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
