00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
Timothy chapter 1 verses 18 through 20 will be our text of Scripture this morning.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.180
The first chapter of this letter ends with a charge.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.979
We see that in verse number 18, this charge, and we find that the charge that is given

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:19.459
would have been understood by Timothy as being an urgent command.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:27.180
In fact, the language that is used here would often be used within the context of military

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.099
conversation and giving some commands and what have you.

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:38.500
And so the language that's used would refer to the command that would be handed down from

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.860
a superior officer.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.200
And so Timothy would have understood the usage of this particular word, and we understand

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.380
even as we look at these few verses of Scripture that Paul had a special relationship with

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.380
Timothy.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.020
We see that noted in this text where the Bible talks about this charge, I commit unto thee

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.299
son Timothy.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.779
We find that there was a special relationship between Paul and Timothy.

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:05.019
He often would refer to him as being his son in the faith.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.540
But we find that Paul, having an understanding that his course, his ministry, would soon

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.540
come to an end, that he sought to encourage Timothy, and his encouragement here as we

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.339
find at the end of verse number 18 is that he might war a good warfare.

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:30.180
I've used that for the text or for the title of our message this morning, War a Good Warfare.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.980
Ask this question, is it even possible?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.260
Well, of course it is if the charge would be given from Paul to Timothy, and we know

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.540
that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
Is it possible that we could war a good warfare?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.339
The answer is yes, but then we must understand how it is that we can accomplish this.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:51.660
And I hope this morning that through these three verses of Scripture that we'd have the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:00.099
opportunity to be encouraged as we too are given this charge to war a good warfare.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:05.779
Notice the Bible says this in verse 18, this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy, according

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:12.740
to the prophecies which went on before on thee, it says that thou by them mightest war

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.860
a good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some having put away concerning faith

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.860
have made shipwreck, of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.020
Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.940
It's interesting even in the beginning of verse number 18 as we begin to look at this

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.860
charge that God would give through Paul to Timothy, he reminds him of his calling and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.820
when we spoke about the beginning of this study through 1 Timothy, we said how can we

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.779
be equipped to continue?

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:49.020
One of the factors that we mentioned that God gives us to equip us for continuing is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.820
that reminder of the calling that God has placed upon our lives.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.020
The purpose that God has for us, Paul revealed in the opening statements of this letter his

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.820
understanding of his call, his purpose, that he was an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.820
of God.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.779
He says in the second letter, by the will of God, and we made note that God's command

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:20.899
is God's will and God's will is God's command, and we find that Timothy, he too was called

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:26.820
of God and we found that as we studied through the beginning portions of the scripture of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.100
chapter number one, the calling that God placed upon the life of Timothy, and then Paul says

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.979
according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:39.979
good warfare.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:46.339
Paul mentions in the second epistle, 2 Timothy chapter number one, he talks about how he

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:52.139
was called, Timothy was called and ordained for the ministry where he was equipped by

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.619
God, and we find here in this text of scripture that God gives us insight, I believe, with

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.779
how we, how Timothy could war a good warfare.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:08.899
Remember, he's left in Ephesus, and in Ephesus we find that there's this introduction of

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:15.339
false teaching, we find that Timothy was left there and he had been given the responsibility

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:23.100
that he would charge some, according to verse number three, that they teach no other doctrine,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.100
and we find that here Paul encourages Timothy to continue on, to not give up in the face

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.100
of adversity when things were challenging and things were difficult, that he was called

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.940
of God and he had a purpose and God would equip him and he must continue here, he says

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.559
war a good warfare.

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:50.779
I think this morning as we consider this thought, I want you to consider with me first of all

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:56.100
if you're taking notes, number one, we must understand the battle.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.339
We must understand the battle.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:03.299
Paul says very clearly, war a good warfare.

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:08.299
Now think about the usage, we understand that God has given, the Bible tells us of itself

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:12.899
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God, we believe that God gave every word,

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.420
and we find that here as we look at this text of scripture that Paul was communicating to

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.739
Timothy, the fact that this is battle, this is a war.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.420
We understand this morning that we are engaged in spiritual warfare and it's important that

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.260
we understand the battle.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.880
Paul, no doubt in his life and his ministry, he clearly understood the battle.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.579
In just a little while we would read in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 7 how he says this,

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:42.299
I have fought a good fight.

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:46.459
We find that it was Tozer that said this, that the Christian life is best described

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:51.140
not as a playground but as a battleground, and we find this morning that it is necessary

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.980
for every child of God to understand that we are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.739
We find that Paul would say this to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter number 2 if you hold

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:05.420
your place there in 1 Timothy and look over at what Paul will tell him in this second

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.179
epistle, he tells him in chapter number 2 with regard to this thought of understanding

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.820
the battle.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.980
Far too many, I believe, do not understand the spiritual battle that we are engaged in

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.059
and therefore we cannot war a good warfare because we do not understand that we're engaged

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.059
in battle.

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:32.899
And he says in chapter number 2 of 2 Timothy in verse number 3, thou therefore endure hardness

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:38.059
notice as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:42.619
Know man that wareth and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:47.420
please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.100
You know when you trust that Christ is your Savior you became a soldier of the cross.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.940
And we understand that Paul will say to the believers in Philippi that there are those

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.339
that are the enemies of the cross.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:04.540
And there is a spiritual battle, there is a spiritual warfare that is taking place.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.459
Come back to Ephesians 6 if you will, a familiar passage of scripture, but we must be mindful

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:15.940
of the truth that Paul is writing to Timothy and as he's giving this charge to Timothy,

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.100
remember Timothy was left at Ephesus.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.619
This is the place where he was left and we find that Paul says to him that I besought

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:29.500
thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.579
And so Paul, we compare scripture with scripture and as we look at the book of Ephesians we

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:41.059
get insight with regard to this truth of the spiritual battle that would be, Timothy would

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:42.059
be engaged in.

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:46.940
In verse number 10 of Ephesians 6 the Bible says this, finally my brethren, now Paul here

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.100
is writing to the church at Ephesus.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.459
But he says to these believers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:03.660
Notice verse number 11, put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.660
against the what?

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.619
The wiles of the devil.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:13.619
That word is interesting in the fact that it means the craftiness, the trickery, the

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:19.619
deceit of the enemy and he says that you might be able to stand or to put on the whole armor

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:20.619
of God.

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:26.299
Obviously the image of a Christian soldier is on full display in Ephesians chapter number

00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:31.540
6 and then Paul would say to Timothy that you might war a good warfare.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.979
In verse number 12 notice the Bible says, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:43.059
but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.659
world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:53.460
It is absolutely essential that the child of God understands who the true enemy is.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.419
It's absolutely essential that we, as we're engaged in this warfare, as we understand

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:04.780
the battle that we are engaged in, that we understand who the enemy is, that we are fighting,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.419
that we're engaged in this spiritual warfare and we're fighting not against flesh and blood

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:13.380
but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.020
He says in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.580
No, they're spiritual.

00:09:20.619 --> 00:09:27.099
You notice in verse 13 of Ephesians 6 he says, wherefore, based on the fact that we're engaged

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.659
in this spiritual warfare, that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:36.140
spiritual wickedness in high places, take unto you the whole armor of God that you may

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.299
be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand.

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:46.380
Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.500
righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.140
all taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.979
darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of God.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:05.099
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:10.979
in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all

00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:12.979
saints."

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:18.699
The church at Ephesus had been given the instruction with regard to the spiritual battle that they

00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:20.019
would be engaged in.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:25.179
In fact, the church leaders at Ephesus, according to Acts chapter number 20, Paul calls for

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:26.459
those church leaders.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.459
He dealt with this several weeks ago, and as he calls for those church leaders from

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:35.619
the church at Ephesus to come and to meet with him before he would head to Jerusalem,

00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:41.579
he tells them that he knew that there would be some grievous wolves that would enter in.

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:43.699
They would not spare the flock.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:48.579
He said not only that, but there'd be some men that would creep up of their own selves,

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:51.199
and so Paul had given warning.

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:56.259
God had used the apostle Paul to warn the leaders of the church at Ephesus to give the

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:01.939
instruction to the believers at the church at Ephesus, and we find now that as he's writing

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:07.819
to Timothy, he says to Timothy, this is the plan that God has for your life.

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:13.399
Timothy, you're to stay there in Ephesus, and you're to charge some that they teach

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:20.299
no other doctrine, and as you're engaged in this ministry that God has placed you in,

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:27.179
remember Paul just finished, as we looked at last week, verses 12-17, this great passage

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:33.619
of praise, God put me in the ministry and all of this truth and worshiping the Lord

00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:39.179
because of salvation, and we find here that Paul is going to tell Timothy, listen, it's

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:47.059
spiritual battle, but God's put you here, and you're going to, the challenge, the charge

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:50.739
is to war a good warfare.

00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:55.539
Well, in order to do that, I must first understand that it's a battle.

00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:56.699
It's a battle.

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:57.779
There's spiritual wickedness.

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:59.899
There are those that are the enemies of the cross.

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:02.379
You say, pastor, we understand.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.339
You don't have to say a whole lot more.

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:09.039
We live in this world, and we understand the spiritual battle that we're engaged in.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:13.499
Number two, as you look at the text of Scripture, not only what must we understand the battle,

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:18.179
but number two, we must be unwavering in our belief.

00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:20.499
We must be unwavering in our belief.

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:23.339
Notice what Paul says in verse number 19.

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:27.739
These two words to begin the verse of Scripture, he says, holding faith.

00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:32.459
Now, think about when you hold something, it means that you have it, you possess it,

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:37.559
you're holding it, and Paul tells Timothy here to be really, I believe, as you look

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:43.259
at the text of Scripture, to have this perspective of being unwavering in our belief.

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:44.259
Holding faith.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:49.539
He tells him that he's to charge some, that they teach no other doctrine, and we find

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:54.779
here that it's absolutely imperative that we are sound in faith.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:00.059
Remember that Paul mentions in verse number 11 about the glorious gospel.

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:04.819
In verse number 10, he talks about the sound doctrine, and we said that verse number 10,

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:08.419
when he refers to sound doctrine, he's talking about that which is healthy, that which is

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:11.779
right, that which is sound.

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:17.819
We must be unwavering in our belief, and when we understand the truth of God's Word,

00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:21.299
we must stand on the truth of God's Word.

00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:25.299
Notice in Ephesians chapter 4, I keep going back to Ephesians throughout this message

00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:32.579
today, because this is the place where Paul says that Timothy was left to minister.

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:37.939
And in Ephesians chapter number 4, I want you to notice about this truth of being sound

00:13:37.939 --> 00:13:41.939
in faith, and notice what the Bible says.

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:46.739
In Ephesians 4 and verse number 11, the Bible says, and he gave some apostles and some prophets

00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:51.539
and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers, and so what is the purpose that

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:57.539
God gave these to the church, it says in verse number 12, for the perfecting of the saints,

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:02.379
for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:07.139
the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:09.819
the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:16.739
But notice verse 14, that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:23.979
about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they

00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:27.459
lie in wait to deceive.

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:33.219
You know, the battle that we're in, but we must be unwavering in our belief, why?

00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:38.059
Because there are those that lie in wait to deceive.

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:43.419
They do it through the slight of hand, it says the slight of men, it talks about the

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:50.099
cunning craftiness, the witty use and beguiling, Paul talks about that in the book of Colossians,

00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:52.619
be not beguiled, let no man beguile you.

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:56.699
And we find that in verse 14, it's a great picture, he says that we henceforth be no

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:01.619
more children, and obviously he's talking about that maturation process, the fact that

00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:03.939
we come to spiritual maturity.

00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:10.499
And notice what he says, that we be not tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind

00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:11.499
of doctrine.

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:17.879
You ever see a tree in a storm as it's tossed to and fro and it's just moving back and forth?

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:23.419
And there are some people that are just, they just kind of waver, they're just not settled,

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:28.659
they're not grounded, they're not sure, they're not unwavering as we see here.

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:32.579
And Paul says to Timothy, hold, holding faith.

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:39.059
Notice what it says in verse 15, but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:42.419
all things which is the head, even Christ.

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.659
We find that we're to be settled and grounded.

00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:50.139
We understand this morning that we're to be unwavering in our belief.

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:54.779
You say, pastor, aren't we to be open-minded?

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:59.899
So often people say, oh, you're just too closed-minded, you're too narrow-minded.

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:00.899
You need to be more open-minded.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:04.739
No, no, we have to just know the Bible.

00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:10.579
And when we can establish the truth of God's Word, when we can understand the teaching

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:16.399
that God has given to us, and we study the Scriptures, and we come to the conclusion

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:22.739
that God has given us in His Word, we must be unwavering in our belief.

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:25.779
We must not be tossed to and fro with every wind and doctrine.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:31.099
We must not be open to, let's have open discussion, you know, what do you think about this?

00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:32.979
And what do you believe about that?

00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:37.619
And let's just have other people from other denominations and other groups come in and,

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:43.199
no, no, no, we must be students of this Word, and we must be unwavering in faith.

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:51.579
He says this back in 1 Timothy 1, notice in verse 6, he said that some have swerved.

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:52.579
Some have swerved.

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:53.819
And what do they do?

00:16:53.819 --> 00:16:59.139
They turned aside into vain jangling, and said that that was useless talk.

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:03.259
They had a desire to teach the Word, but they weren't qualified to teach the Word, to teach

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:06.499
the law, and they did not have the qualification.

00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:09.459
They did not understand what they said.

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:13.459
And we find that there were some that had swerved, but then notice as we look in our

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:17.979
text of Scripture this morning, notice what some, not only some have swerved according

00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:22.539
to verse number 6, but notice in verse 19, he says, holding faith in a good conscience,

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:28.499
which some having put away concerning faith.

00:17:28.499 --> 00:17:35.639
Now that word put away literally carries with it the idea of to thrust something, really

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:36.779
to throw it away.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:38.659
They've put it away.

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:43.179
Now think about the truth that Paul is communicating to Timothy.

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:45.339
He's saying, Timothy, you need to war a good warfare.

00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:48.979
Timothy, I've left you there so that you could charge some, they would teach no other

00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:49.979
doctrine.

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:53.179
Timothy, yes, there are some that have swerved and they've turned to vain jangling.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:55.419
Timothy, it's a battle.

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:58.379
There are some that have put away concerning the faith.

00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:00.659
They have thrust it away.

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:05.819
But Timothy, be unwavering in your belief.

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:08.819
Be settled and grounded.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:13.739
You know it's not popular today to say that Jesus is the only way to heaven.

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:14.939
You understand that, right?

00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:18.179
You know that that's not popular today.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:22.259
We can be called all sorts of words and names and things because we say that Jesus is the

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:24.099
only way.

00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:32.500
But the reality is that my Bible says that Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.500
life.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:41.699
No man, that means there's no exceptions, cometh unto the Father, but by me.

00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:42.699
Amen?

00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:46.979
I don't need to be open-minded about that.

00:18:46.979 --> 00:18:50.419
I don't need to take a perspective that, well, as long as you're sincere in what you believe.

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:51.419
No, no, no.

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:53.260
Jesus said, I am the way.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.260
He didn't say, I am a way.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.299
He said, I am the way.

00:18:56.299 --> 00:19:03.339
By the way, that gives us great responsibility to go forth and preach the gospel of Jesus

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:05.979
Christ because how can they hear?

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.299
How are they going to believe in Him of whom they've not heard?

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:12.699
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:13.699
Amen?

00:19:13.699 --> 00:19:16.739
We're to be unwavering in our belief.

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:22.260
Notice these that have put away, they've thrust away concerning faith according to verse 19.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.419
Notice what the Bible says, have made shipwreck.

00:19:25.419 --> 00:19:31.940
That's kind of an interesting picture that Paul paints here with regard, and he's going

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.959
to name two people by name in verse 20, we'll get to it in just a moment.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.559
But I want you to think about the result of having put away, of thrusting away this sound,

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:47.279
this correct teaching, this, as he says in verse number 10, sound doctrine, the truth

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:53.839
that God has given that they teach no other doctrine, that they are just swerving and

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:57.079
thrusting away, turning away, putting away.

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.639
He says that they've made shipwreck.

00:19:58.639 --> 00:19:59.839
Now think about being shipwrecked.

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:07.519
It's probably, at this particular time in history, the worst thing that could happen

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:14.079
to someone as far as travel is concerned, to be shipwrecked.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.359
And what Paul is saying is that's what they've done with their life.

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:20.999
You ever hear somebody say that somebody's made shipwreck of their life?

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:28.239
And here we find that Paul says because they have put away, literally thrusting away faith,

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:34.279
the teaching, the belief that they, this picture, this painting, the result, that they've

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:36.479
made shipwreck.

00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:42.319
He names two people in verse number 20, of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:47.119
Now we find that in 2 Timothy 2, in verse 17 and 18, Paul gives further insight with

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:52.119
regard to Hymenaeus with regard to what his false teaching was and what was going on.

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:56.799
In verse 17 of 2 Timothy 2, it says, And the word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is

00:20:56.799 --> 00:21:01.479
Hymenaeus and Philetus, who concerning the truth have erred.

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:05.359
Were they saying that the resurrection has passed already, and notice, and overthrow

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:06.359
the faith of some?

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:08.559
I said this a couple of weeks ago.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.599
It's amazing how false teachers can get such a following.

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:17.159
It's amazing how so many people can believe the lies.

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:21.319
And it says that they've overthrown the faith of some.

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:26.519
So Paul mentions in the second letter about this character Hymenaeus.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:30.239
Now some think that Alexander might be Alexander the coppersmith that's mentioned at the end

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:33.999
of chapter number 4 there in 2 Timothy.

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:37.079
Whether that's the truth or not, he refers to him as Alexander the coppersmith in the

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:38.279
second letter.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:42.119
Whether this is the same character or not, we do not know for certainty.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:46.039
The name is actually a pretty popular name, so it could have been a different individual.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:52.859
But what we know is that these have thrust away, they've put away concerning faith.

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:54.279
And so what happens?

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:58.839
Well as we look in verse number 20, a verse of Scripture that some have really struggled

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:04.199
with, notice what Paul says at the end, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:07.639
learn not to blaspheme.

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:11.959
Now I believe as you look at this portion of Scripture that what Paul is dealing with

00:22:11.959 --> 00:22:17.319
is that of church discipline, and really the last step of church discipline.

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:21.959
When you look through the process of church discipline, we find that the process is that

00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:27.119
as you go to the individual, that if there is repentance, there's to be restoration.

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:32.679
I made the statement last week that the goal on Wednesday evening, warn them that are unruly,

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:38.719
was our text on Wednesday evening, that the goal of church discipline is not excommunication.

00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:42.759
The goal of church discipline is restoration.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:48.319
And we find though that there are some, when you go through the process of church discipline,

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:51.439
that they do not respond.

00:22:51.439 --> 00:22:52.439
So what's the end result?

00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:53.439
You put them out of the church.

00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:56.079
What's the end result of church discipline?

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:58.639
The last step of church discipline.

00:22:58.639 --> 00:23:03.359
And I believe that's what Paul is speaking of here, this last step of church discipline

00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:07.199
whereby these individuals were put out of the church.

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:08.199
Guess what that means?

00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:12.999
By the way, whose domain and dominion is the world?

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:14.359
It's Satan's.

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:19.319
The God of this world, 2 Corinthians, right, hath blinded the minds of them which believe

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:20.319
not.

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:25.639
And so notice what he says, that I've delivered them unto Satan, that they may learn not to

00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:27.839
blaspheme.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:33.479
So they were blasphemous, and we find that when he says learn, that idea of learning

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:36.279
is to learn by discipline.

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:41.079
Did you ever say to a child, did you learn your lesson?

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:46.359
You disciplined them so that they would learn, and the goal is that there would be correction

00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:48.519
of behavior.

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:50.879
And Paul says that they might learn not to blaspheme.

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:55.039
Note, hold your place here and turn over to Matthew chapter 18 quickly this morning as

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:59.479
we look at this truth with regard to church discipline and understanding the teaching

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.959
that Jesus gave with regard to church discipline.

00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:11.319
In chapter number 18 of the Gospel of Matthew, in verse 15, down through verse number 17,

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:15.159
we see three steps of church discipline.

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:20.439
The Bible says in verse 15, moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and

00:24:20.439 --> 00:24:25.599
tell him his fault between thee and him alone.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:30.799
If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:37.119
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, then in the mouth of

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:41.039
two or three witnesses every word may be established.

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:44.819
And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church.

00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:52.279
But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:57.039
That's the last step of church discipline, put him out of the church.

00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:00.959
With regard to these individuals that are mentioned, you could jot down maybe 1 Corinthians

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:04.359
5 in verse 5, we're not going to take the time to go there this morning, but if you

00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:08.719
look there, Paul deals with that as well at the church in Corinth in the last step of

00:25:08.719 --> 00:25:12.399
church discipline with that offender that is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5, you might

00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:16.119
want to jot it down and look there later on your own.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:20.159
But here as we come back to 1 Timothy chapter number 1, when he's speaking about these two

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:26.959
individuals, notice what they're doing, they're teaching false doctrine and they are influencing

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:28.919
some.

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:31.479
So Paul says, they need to be dealt with.

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:36.799
It seems as if as we look here, Paul tells Timothy, I've delivered them, we've gone through

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.639
the process, they're out.

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:39.639
Why?

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:44.279
Because we can't leave them in to affect the body, they need to be dealt with.

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:48.119
I had a situation years ago here, and the person hasn't been in church here for years,

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:51.799
in fact they're with the Lord now, but they were here and they were trying to peddle some

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:55.039
false teaching.

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.039
You know how they were trying to do it?

00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.479
They were trying to hand out books to people.

00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:04.919
And I got aware of it, and so I went and I told that individual, I said, listen, I said,

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:08.199
you're not permitted to pass out any of those books here.

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:11.199
If there's anything you want to distribute here, you've got to give it to me first, and

00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:14.279
if I approve of it, I can let you pass it out.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.999
And they looked at me and they said, who do you think you are?

00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:21.079
I said, well, honestly, I don't think I'm anyone, but God put me here as the pastor

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.579
and I have a responsibility.

00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:27.419
And what you're distributing is not how we believe, and if you want to go somewhere else

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:32.659
and peddle that stuff, that's up to you, but you're not going to peddle it here.

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:36.459
And then he invoked God's judgment on me, but that's okay.

00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:39.299
But he never passed it out to my knowledge ever again.

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:40.299
Why?

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:47.659
Because we have a responsibility to be unwavering in our belief.

00:26:47.659 --> 00:26:52.099
If God said it, that settles it, amen?

00:26:52.099 --> 00:26:56.419
It's not meaning that we're trying to be contradictory just to be contradictory.

00:26:56.419 --> 00:27:00.779
It's not that we're trying to be ugly to be ugly to be, no, no, no, we just got to believe

00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:01.779
what God said.

00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:04.779
We're going to believe what God said.

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:10.099
Not only must we understand the battle, not only must we be unwavering in our belief,

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:15.459
but number three this morning, if we're going to war a good warfare, we must be upright

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:17.099
in our behavior.

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:19.099
We must be upright in our behavior.

00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:24.419
Notice what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1, in verse number 19, he says, holding faith.

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:32.019
That's unwavering in your belief, but he says this, and a good conscience.

00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:37.739
Being upright in our behavior, Paul said some things with regard to his conscience personally.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:42.899
He makes this statement, Acts 23, as he's speaking about his ministry and his life.

00:27:42.899 --> 00:27:47.299
And in Acts 23, in verse number one, he says this, he says, and Paul earnestly beholding

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:54.019
the counsel said, men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until

00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:55.139
this day.

00:27:55.139 --> 00:28:00.499
He says in chapter 24, in verse number 16, when he's standing there before Felix at this

00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:08.819
point, he says, and herein do I exercise myself to always, to have always a conscience void

00:28:08.819 --> 00:28:13.579
of offense toward God and toward men.

00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:20.699
And now Paul says to Timothy, holding faith and a good conscience.

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:26.459
We see that Paul makes those statements of his own self and his own ministry and his

00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:29.299
own life in Acts 23 and Acts 24.

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:33.699
We find that Paul gives this charge with regard to upright behavior.

00:28:33.699 --> 00:28:37.459
He says here in 1 Timothy 1, in verse 19, a good conscience.

00:28:37.459 --> 00:28:45.299
It's interesting, in chapter 3, in verse number 9, he speaks about a pure conscience.

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:53.099
So a good and a pure conscience, in my understanding of Scripture, is the result of righteous living.

00:28:53.099 --> 00:28:55.819
It's the result of righteous living.

00:28:55.819 --> 00:29:00.979
Why does Paul say I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense before

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:02.979
God and before men?

00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:07.659
It's that idea of righteous living that we're to be upright in our behavior that we could

00:29:07.659 --> 00:29:13.499
have, as Paul says, holding faith and a good conscience.

00:29:13.499 --> 00:29:18.619
It's the opposite of having a seared conscience.

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:24.819
In 1 Timothy 4, in verse number 2, Paul speaks about those false teachers, that they're speaking

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:31.339
lies and hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron.

00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:35.619
Paul says this in Titus, chapter number 1, in verse number 15, that there were some that

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:39.499
had a defiled conscience.

00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:43.539
It says, unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:50.499
is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

00:29:50.499 --> 00:29:58.059
We find here this morning that Paul says to Timothy, we're a good warfare.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:29:59.259
It's a battle.

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:05.739
Be unwavering in your belief, but Timothy, be upright in your behavior.

00:30:05.739 --> 00:30:11.239
Live a life that's pure, righteous living.

00:30:11.239 --> 00:30:16.859
This morning there are many in our society today that have sought to criticize righteous

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:19.999
living.

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:24.199
No one's allowed to have fun anymore, I don't know.

00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:26.479
Seeking to please God.

00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:31.459
Seeking to live in a manner by which God is honored and glorified.

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:36.819
We find here that as we consider the truth of this good conscience that is spoken of

00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:41.619
in verse 19, that it is possible for you, it's possible for me, just as it was possible

00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:46.939
for Timothy, to hold faith, to be unwavering in our belief, but also to have a good conscience,

00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:49.099
to be upright in our behavior.

00:30:49.099 --> 00:30:53.679
I would say that it's absolutely essential that we understand that we, as the ministers

00:30:53.679 --> 00:31:00.219
of God, as those that are called of the Lord to carry His truth, to be His representatives,

00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:03.099
that we ought to be upright in our behavior.

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:08.379
It doesn't mean that we're going to ever be perfect, to have no sin in our lives, but

00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:13.659
the reality is that we must be living in such a way that we're seeking to please, honor,

00:31:13.659 --> 00:31:16.019
and glorify our God.

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:20.779
That we'd understand that as Peter says, as he's referring back to even the truth of the

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:26.479
book of Leviticus, where God says to His people, be holy, for I am holy, and Peter

00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:32.179
says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation, that in your life and in my

00:31:32.179 --> 00:31:37.559
life that we're to live righteously, that we're to live godly.

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:41.359
Notice what the Bible says in Titus chapter number 2.

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:45.519
In Titus chapter number 2, now understand today that this thought, this teaching of

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:51.499
grace has been really twisted up, and it's not just today because we find that Jude speaks

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:58.619
about those that would just seek to be false teachers, and they were denying the truth

00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:05.059
of God's Word, and Jude is writing to get them to earnestly contend for the faith, but

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:10.219
he says that they've turned the grace of our God into lasciviousness, unbridled lust, just

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.499
do what you want to do.

00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:16.079
Today there's a term antinomianism, right?

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:20.839
You might never have heard of that term, and if you have people today that use this terminology,

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:24.519
oh, you can just do whatever you want to do, you're under grace.

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:26.759
That's foreign to God's Word.

00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:29.639
That is foreign to God's Word.

00:32:29.639 --> 00:32:32.639
God says that we're not to use our liberty as an occasion of the flesh in the book of

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:34.599
Galatians.

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:39.199
Here in Titus chapter number 2, notice what the Bible says about the grace of God.

00:32:39.339 --> 00:32:44.979
In verse number 11 it says, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation, notice, hath

00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:46.299
appeared to how many men?

00:32:46.299 --> 00:32:47.979
To all men.

00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:49.739
But notice what that grace teaches us.

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:51.059
It tells us in the next verse.

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:53.699
We don't have to just kind of try to figure it out on our own.

00:32:53.699 --> 00:33:02.499
It says, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live how?

00:33:02.499 --> 00:33:08.699
Soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:09.699
Why?

00:33:09.699 --> 00:33:15.799
Because Jesus is coming, looking, notice verse 13, for that blessed hope and the glorious

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:20.679
appearing of the great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:27.719
John says this in 1 John, that whoever has this hope in him, that he purifies himself

00:33:27.719 --> 00:33:29.079
even as he is pure.

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:30.079
What is the hope?

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:32.599
That Jesus is coming again.

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:37.599
The end of 1 John chapter 3 and the beginning of chapter number 4 deals with that truth.

00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:41.739
And this morning, I keep saying this evening, I'm not sure why, but this morning as we

00:33:41.739 --> 00:33:46.699
look at this text of scripture and we see that Paul is giving this charge, we must be

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:49.739
upright in our behavior, this good conscience.

00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:54.179
You ever find somebody, we might use the phrase that they have a guilty conscience, you ever

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:55.499
have somebody like that?

00:33:55.499 --> 00:33:59.779
I remember talking to some folks that are in law enforcement and every time they'd get

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:05.459
behind somebody that had some guilt, they'd be doing weird things and kind of just telling

00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:11.039
everybody else that they're guilty by their behavior, by the things that they start doing,

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:13.159
getting antsy and all that kind of stuff.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:19.439
Listen, we can have a good conscience, a pure conscience, but it's the result of righteous

00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:21.599
living.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.879
It's the result of righteous living.

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:29.439
I ask this question, does my behavior align with the principles contained within this

00:34:29.439 --> 00:34:31.099
book?

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:36.239
Does my behavior, does your behavior align with the principles that we find in God's

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.299
Word?

00:34:38.299 --> 00:34:40.759
God speaks much to His people in the Old Testament.

00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:44.559
We find too in the New Testament, there's much instruction given to us with regard to

00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:50.239
godly living, but it's amazing as you look at the Old Testament and consider as God is

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:55.679
giving His moral law to His people and explaining to them the importance of their behavior and

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.999
their living and to be holy.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:02.559
He says to them that you're not to behave like you saw there in Egypt, you're not to

00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:07.719
behave like you'll see of the peoples of the land, no, you're to behave, you're to live

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:12.159
according to my precepts, according to my principles.

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:16.839
I've said this from the pulpit before, the book of Exodus reveals to us how God gets

00:35:16.839 --> 00:35:18.959
His people out of Egypt.

00:35:18.959 --> 00:35:24.959
The book of Leviticus reveals to us how God gets Egypt out of His people.

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:32.639
All of us understand the importance of righteous living.

00:35:32.639 --> 00:35:34.519
I believe that this morning.

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:36.759
We understand the importance.

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:39.679
Sometimes it's the practice.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:45.639
And here this morning we find that I have to believe what's right, but I also have to

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:47.679
live right.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:52.759
I have to believe right and I have to live right.

00:35:52.759 --> 00:35:57.799
And this morning, if we're going to war a good warfare, if Timothy is going to war a

00:35:57.799 --> 00:36:04.399
good warfare, we have to understand it's a battle, it is a battle.

00:36:04.399 --> 00:36:13.199
We are soldiers of the cross, onward, forward, we sing the song, we're soldiers of the cross.

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:17.879
But there are those that are the enemies of the cross and we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

00:36:17.879 --> 00:36:23.519
we are fighting not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:28.379
Number two, we must be unwavering in our belief.

00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:30.319
Be settled and grounded.

00:36:30.319 --> 00:36:32.879
Know what you believe and why you believe it.

00:36:32.879 --> 00:36:35.439
Be able to defend it biblically.

00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:36.439
Why do you believe that?

00:36:36.439 --> 00:36:37.879
Because my pastor said it.

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:39.839
Well, that's what our church believes.

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:40.839
No, no, no.

00:36:40.839 --> 00:36:43.799
It has to go far deeper than that.

00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:46.439
You have to be able to have verses of Scripture.

00:36:46.439 --> 00:36:51.919
You've got to be able to turn to God's Word and say, here's why I believe that, unwavering.

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:56.299
And that's the only reason that we would be unwavering in our belief is because it's founded

00:36:56.299 --> 00:37:01.019
on God's Word and God alone is true.

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:06.759
That's why we're to be unwavering in our belief, but we must be upright in our behavior, that

00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:12.179
we would live, that we would walk as children of the light, that we would live lives that

00:37:12.179 --> 00:37:18.939
are pleasing to God, that we would be that vessel that's meat for the master's use.

00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:25.019
He's given us sound doctrine, but we're to live righteously as we deliver that message

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:27.059
to a lost and dying world.

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:32.419
So often, I'm sure you've heard it just as I have, people will attack and criticize Christians

00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:38.659
and churches, and one of the attacks that they make is this, they're full of hypocrites.

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:41.619
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:45.259
I've heard it so many times.

00:37:45.259 --> 00:37:50.939
The reality is that there are times in our lives that we give occasion to the enemy,

00:37:50.939 --> 00:37:54.139
and we may live hypocritical lives.

00:37:54.139 --> 00:38:00.539
Just reading this morning in 2 Samuel, how David and his behavior gave occasion to the

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:04.339
enemy to speak against God.

00:38:04.339 --> 00:38:08.219
Listen, we must be upright in our behavior.

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.979
We got to believe right, but we got to live right.

00:38:10.979 --> 00:38:11.979
Let's pray together.

00:38:11.979 --> 00:38:12.979
Father, we love You.

00:38:12.979 --> 00:38:14.499
We thank You for loving us.

00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:17.579
We thank You for the privilege of having Your Word.

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:22.619
God, we've been enlisted in a fight.

00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:30.259
Lord, we're thankful that You've given us Your Word, and in Your Word, You have revealed

00:38:30.259 --> 00:38:34.259
to us that we're engaged in a spiritual battle.

00:38:34.259 --> 00:38:40.019
God, we thank You that we can have victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:50.899
I pray that You'd help us to have an understanding of Your Word, to be settled and grounded,

00:38:50.899 --> 00:38:55.939
to be unwavering in our belief, Lord, that we'd know why we believe what we believe,

00:38:55.939 --> 00:38:58.739
that we'd be ready to give an answer.

00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:01.379
I pray, Father, that You'd help us to be upright in our behavior.

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:06.979
Lord, help us to live in a manner which is pleasing to Thee.

00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:10.579
Help us to be holy in all manner of conversation.

00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:14.259
I pray, Lord, that You would help us to be able to war a good warfare.

00:39:14.259 --> 00:39:15.459
Thank You for the instruction.

00:39:15.459 --> 00:39:17.499
Thank You for the equipping.

00:39:17.499 --> 00:39:19.699
I pray, Lord, that You'd work in hearts and lives.

00:39:19.699 --> 00:39:24.219
Maybe this morning one is not saved, or they need to trust Christ as their Savior this

00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:25.219
morning.

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:32.699
Maybe, God, there's some that some way through the message, You've just touched on an area

00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:33.699
of their lives.

00:39:33.699 --> 00:39:39.019
God, I pray that You'd help us to be responsive.

00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:43.219
Just as we've been ready to receive, that we'd be ready to respond, that we'd be obedient,

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:46.379
that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:50.659
Help us, Lord, to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ.

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:53.619
I pray that You'd move and work in the moment of invitation, that through all that's said

00:39:53.619 --> 00:39:55.459
and done, that You alone would be glorified.

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.299
It's in Christ's name we pray.
