WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Genesis chapter 47, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 12, and then we'll skip down and look at verses 28 through 31.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.500
And next Sunday evening we'll deal with verses 13 through 27.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.299
Next Sunday evening, and so we'll be looking at this passage at the end of chapter 46, you'll recall with me

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.500
that in Genesis 46, the Lord chose, He recorded for us

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.799
the sweet reunion between Jacob and Joseph.

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:30.100
And of course, we had mentioned as we've studied through this book of the Bible, the book of Genesis,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.900
and over the last several weeks in particular, looking at the life of Joseph in these chapters,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.400
we've mentioned that it's been over 20 years since the last time Jacob and Joseph

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.599
had had the opportunity to see each other.

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.799
Joseph, of course, was sent out to check on his brothers.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.099
He was obedient to the instruction of his father to go and to check on his brothers,

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.799
and he never came home.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:02.000
The brothers, of course, allowed, really led Jacob, and then allowed Jacob to believe that Joseph had been killed,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.599
that he'd been devoured by an evil beast.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:10.900
And for all these years, Jacob lived believing that his son, Joseph, was dead.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.099
And of course, we know that when the brothers first arrive in Egypt because of the famine

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.400
that Joseph is in charge, and he immediately recognizes his brothers,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.900
but the brothers do not know that it's Joseph, no doubt.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.900
The Bible tells us he spoke through an interpreter.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.099
He would have been dressed in a certain manner and what have you,

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.500
and his identity was not known by his brothers.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.099
But then we find on subsequent visit that he, Joseph, reveals his identity

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.800
each time he inquires about the welfare of dad.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.699
And you can see his heart and his desire to see how his dad was doing.

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:52.699
And we find that as Joseph was there, he had this perspective,

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:57.099
and we found this in the last couple of chapters as we've studied through the book of Genesis.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.400
He understood that God was at work.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.599
He understood that God had a plan.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:08.800
And I'm thankful this evening that God's at work in our lives and God has a plan for us today.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.399
And though his plan for us this evening is different than it was for Joseph,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.600
we can rest assured that the almighty, sovereign God knows who we are and where we are,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.300
and he has a plan for us.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.800
And Joseph testifies in Genesis 45 in verse number 7,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.300
and I just want to mention this verse because it helps us to see the perspective of Joseph.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.000
And he says to his brothers after he reveals himself at the beginning of the chapter,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.399
he says in verse number 7,

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:46.600
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.699
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:56.699
God would graciously allow Jacob to live there in Egypt for 17 years,

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.300
according to what we'll study this evening in Genesis 47.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.300
We find that Jacob, of course, in chapter 46, before he would depart,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.000
he received those promises.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.600
And we focused last Sunday evening on how God gives us promises

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.000
and how those promises give us the hope and the strength

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.300
and the confidence and the faith that we need on this journey called life.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.500
And not only does he give us the promises,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.199
but we mentioned last week that he gives us that protection for the journey

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:33.300
and how blessed we are to serve a sovereign God who is our protection.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.199
He provides us with that safety.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.000
He's our shield, our buckler.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.500
And what a joy to understand that.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.899
And so now as we look at Genesis 47,

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:48.000
and we see the fact that Jacob and Joseph have been reunited at the end of chapter 46,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.399
Joseph gives some instruction with regard to the meeting

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:57.000
that he knew would take place with Pharaoh and some of his brothers.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.600
And we find that he kind of prepped them.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.600
He gave them a little bit of an introduction of what to say and how to handle this.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.000
And we come to chapter 47 and the Bible says in verse number one,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.800
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.699
Notice what Joseph says to Pharaoh,

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.899
my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:20.299
and all that they have are come out of the land of Canaan

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.200
and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.299
And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:34.000
And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, what is your occupation?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.600
And they said unto Pharaoh, thy servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.100
It's kind of interesting, Joseph specifically told them in chapter 46,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.200
do not mention that you're shepherds.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.899
They didn't listen real well.

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.200
It's immediately the answer that they give.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.600
In verse number four, it says, they said moreover unto Pharaoh,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.899
for to sojourn in the land are we come,

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.600
for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.100
for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.200
Now therefore we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Notice with me, if you will skip over and look at verse 28,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.000
the Bible says, and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.500
So the whole age of Jacob was 140 and seven years.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
We'll look through the verses as we get through the message this evening,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.399
but I've titled the message tonight from verse 28,

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.799
Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years.

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:33.299
I want you to notice as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:37.700
if you're taking notes tonight, number one, they received a place.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.600
They received a place. Notice with me, pick it back up with me in verse number five,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.600
as Pharaoh begins to speak in response to what he hears

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.399
from these brothers of Joseph that stand there before him and give this answer.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.100
And Pharaoh speaks in verse number five, and notice what Pharaoh says.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.100
He's speaking to Joseph saying, thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.399
And then in verse number six, the Bible says the land of Egypt is before thee.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.100
Notice this, pay close attention.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:15.100
It says, in the best of the land, make thy father and brethren to dwell.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.100
In the land of Goshen, let them dwell.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.100
And if thou knowest any men of activity among them,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.200
then make them rulers over my cattle.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.299
We find that in verse number five and six,

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.000
that as Joseph is receiving this response from Pharaoh,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.299
after this brief interaction that's recorded for us to begin the chapter,

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.899
that Pharaoh says in the best of the land.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:43.100
Now, I like that because we find that as we look at this place that they received,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.600
that here the Pharaoh says to Joseph, he gives them, he doesn't just say you pick,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.299
he gives the command in the best of the land.

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:57.299
Notice with me in verse number 11, the Bible says that Joseph,

00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:01.200
he then placed his father and his brethren, notice what the Bible says,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.399
and gave them what? He gave them a possession.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:09.399
He gave them a possession in the land of Egypt.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:15.100
And then what does it say? In the best of the land.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.299
In the land of Ramses, as Pharaoh had commanded,

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:21.399
Joseph was following the instruction.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.399
Of course, he is really, if we'd look at him as being prime minister of Egypt,

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:28.899
if we'd use that terminology this evening, he's second in command.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.299
But Pharaoh has given this instruction,

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:35.399
that as your father and your brothers and your family has come,

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.600
then you're to go and let them be in the best of the land.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.299
Let them be in that place.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:45.700
And then Joseph, he puts them, he gives them a possession in the land,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:51.399
and it says that in the best of the land, in the land of Ramses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:55.799
I'm thankful this evening that as we begin to think about the children of Israel here,

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:59.299
and as they would, as a small family at this point,

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:02.299
Jacob, whose name is turned, changed to Israel,

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.799
and we kind of use it interchangeably,

00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:09.000
and we find that Jacob was concerned when he would leave Canaan,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.299
and it's the land that God had promised to his forefathers,

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.299
but we find that God gave him a great promise

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:19.399
that we looked at last week in Genesis 46, in verses 3 and 4,

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:23.299
and we find that God was fulfilling his promise.

00:08:23.299 --> 00:08:26.000
Notice back, if you will, in chapter 46,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.100
where Jacob, before he departs, before he heads to Egypt,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.200
he hears from God, and God says this in Genesis 46, in verse number 3,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.599
I am God, the God of thy father.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.900
Fear not to go down into Egypt.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.200
Notice, for I will there make of thee a great nation.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.000
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.099
And Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.500
And we find that as they arrive into the land,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.200
that Joseph makes the announcement to Pharaoh,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.599
and he says, my father, my brethren, their families, their flocks,

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:03.200
they've come, they've arrived,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.700
and Pharaoh says, put them in the best of the land.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.799
Here's what I want us to understand this evening.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:14.799
God has the best for us.

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:17.700
You know, when we follow the leadership of God,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.799
when we follow the will of God,

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:23.500
when we get close to the Lord and we desire to know his will,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.400
why was Jacob there?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.599
Because God told him to go there.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:30.099
Jacob didn't just make the decision.

00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:32.099
Yes, there were extenuating circumstances.

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:36.599
There was a great famine, a sore famine, that was affecting Canaan.

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:40.599
But we understand that it was not just the idea of Joseph.

00:09:40.599 --> 00:09:44.099
It was not just the idea of Jacob that they go to Egypt.

00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:48.400
No, God Almighty appeared to him and said,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.900
fear not to go down into Egypt.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.400
It's there in that place that I'm going to build of thee a great nation.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.900
And we find that as they arrive, following the will of God,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.440
the best of the land, the best of the land.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.740
Listen, we don't, we serve a great God.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.460
We serve a great God.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.100
And I'm thankful that our God who is supreme,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.980
our God who is sovereign, our God who is gracious,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.980
that he has in store for his children some great things.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.940
And we serve a great God.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.440
And this evening, as we seek the will of God,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.420
I'm so thankful that God loves us

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.720
and as a sovereign, loving God,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.580
he desires to reveal to us his will.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.160
If you earnestly desire to know the will of God

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.300
for your life, I believe that God will reveal it to you.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.020
God is not playing with your life or with my life.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.600
God is not playing some type of game of hide and seek

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.660
of you trying to mysteriously find the will of God.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.420
God, if you earnestly, sincerely wanna know

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.560
what his will is for your life, he will reveal it to you.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.760
And as you follow the steps that God provides in your life,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.440
you'll see that he provides for you.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.820
And he takes good care of his children.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.720
He's able and he does, he fulfills.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.920
It's an encouragement to me as I read Genesis 47

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.040
and I read that terminology both in verse number six

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.520
and again in verse number 11,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.720
that it's in the best of the land, in the best of the land.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.840
Don't just settle for something, be in the will of God.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.120
The preacher was preaching this morning,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.380
Brother Whitfield, about being in the will of God.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.920
It's so important to be in the will of God.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.600
I remember as we were praying some almost 13 years ago now,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.400
as we were praying and seeking God's face

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.480
for where God would want us to be.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.040
And I remember, you're seeking the face of God.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.440
We faithfully, sincerely wanted to know

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.520
where God do you want us to be?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.260
We didn't just wanna be anywhere

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.540
that we could possibly be.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.720
We wanted to be where God wanted us to be.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.780
And I remember as we prayed,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.460
and I was rehearsing this with Brother Whitfield last night,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.900
how that for several months,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.100
it seemed as if God had made it clear

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.060
that it was time to go full-time

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.940
into the ministry, pastor, church.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.980
And after we had fully surrendered and yielded to that,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.800
it was as if there was no more direction provided.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.980
It was just be faithful where you are.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.620
And we were just serving God faithfully.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.480
And then all of a sudden,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.960
the preacher said in Sunday school this morning,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.840
don't ever tell God you're not gonna go somewhere.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.120
He said he wasn't going to Texas,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.600
and he ends up in Texas.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.640
I remember when we received the correspondence

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.140
in May of 2011 with regard to Fellowship Baptist Church

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.520
in Oakton, Virginia.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.600
Had no idea where Oakton, Virginia was.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.120
Never heard of it in my life.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.760
Then I found out it was basically Washington, D.C.,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.360
and I thought there's no way God's calling me there.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.300
Oakton, in my mind, honestly, transparently,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.780
I think, man, it's a town that's named after an oak tree.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.740
I mean, that's pretty awesome, you know?

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.540
And my mind's thinking of southwestern Virginia,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.020
and that's kind of what I was thinking.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.340
And no, it's not.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.060
But we began to pray.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.500
And I remember the night that the church voted,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.460
as we were anxiously anticipating a phone call,

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.100
here's what Brother Abbott said to me

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.180
when he called me that night.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.000
He said, Brother Mann, do you believe God's called you

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.520
to pastor Fellowship Baptist Church?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.420
And I said, I do.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.320
And he said, well, that's good,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.160
because we voted and it was unanimous.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.000
Do you accept?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.820
And I said, I do.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.760
And he said, well, we have a missionary tonight.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.600
I'll call you later.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.000
That was the end of the phone call.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But God gave us a peace.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.320
And he gave us a peace,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.620
and we just desired to be in the will of God.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.840
And this evening, as we look at Jacob,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.540
and we look at the descendants, the brothers, the families,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.500
it's only a small group of people,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.620
but they're in the place where God led them to be.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.740
And God says through, as God is fulfilling his promise,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.580
as God is using people,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.580
he uses Pharaoh to say to Joseph,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.980
give them the best of the land.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.980
It wasn't just Joseph desiring to set apart the best place

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.440
for his family.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.980
No, Pharaoh said, God was at work.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.400
Listen, the Bible tells us in Proverbs,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.560
I'm gonna preach on this on this upcoming Sunday,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.880
the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.160
God is sovereign, and God works.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.820
They received a place.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.100
Not only did they receive a place,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.900
number two, if you're taking notes this evening,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.800
they received provision.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.240
Received provision.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.000
I mentioned last week, as we looked at chapter 46,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.140
how that there were promises given for the journey.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.380
There were, as we examine that passage of scripture,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.180
a number of promises, but then there was protection.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.620
Safety is of the Lord.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.860
Now, as we come to chapter 47 and the journey is over,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.780
as far as traveling from Canaan to Egypt,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.300
and they arrive and they have a place,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.860
but in this place, they also receive provision.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.900
This is an amazing thing,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.420
as you begin to understand what's happening

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.400
at this time in history, and you think about the famine,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.520
the great famine that's taking place,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.200
and Joseph had already explained to his brothers

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.320
that it had been in the land for two years,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.000
but there were five more years.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.960
Now, we know that from the beginning,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.380
that God had given Pharaoh that dream,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.240
and he had allowed Joseph to be able to interpret the dream,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.280
and there'd be seven years of great plenty,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.440
but then seven years of great famine,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.620
and it would be grievous,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.400
and we find that as Joseph was there,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.880
and he was ministering and distributing

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.720
as he would have the responsibility to do,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.020
that people from all over the world were coming to Egypt.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.280
Thus, the brothers come to Egypt,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.080
because the famines affected Canaan as well,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.340
and Joseph says, but it's five more years,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.340
and as they come to Egypt,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.520
we find that even as they stand there before Pharaoh,

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.900
they say in the text of Scripture that we've read already,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.100
they speak about the famine in verse number four,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.760
for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.220
but as they come to Egypt, and as they're given a place,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.340
they don't just receive a place that's the best,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.760
but we find that as they're there, they receive provision.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.620
All of their needs are taken care of.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.460
It's amazing.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.140
God knows what our needs are,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.180
and God's able to provide.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.760
David says, I was young, I'm old,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.640
but you know what he never witnessed was God's people

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.860
lacking provision.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.960
God's a good God.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.880
You know what the shepherd does?

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.680
The shepherd provides.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.520
You know what the shepherd does?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.400
The shepherd protects.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.360
You know what the shepherd does?

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.360
The shepherd leads.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.460
That's what the shepherd does,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.740
and do you know what our God said?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.340
He said, I'm the shepherd,

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.540
so as he takes and he gives us that picture,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.660
and he helps us to understand, and he says, I am.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.180
I'm the good shepherd, he says.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.820
Yes, he's the great shepherd.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.860
David would proclaim the Lord is my shepherd,

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.540
and we find that as our shepherd, he leads us.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.120
As our shepherd, he protects us, but he provides for us.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.480
That sheep is helpless without the shepherd.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.320
It really is in great danger without the shepherd,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.200
but with the shepherd,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.260
the shepherd leads them beside the still waters.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.860
The shepherd takes care of his needs,

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.480
leads them to the green pastures.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.680
Isn't that what Psalm 23 tells us?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.200
And we find that the good shepherd, he's our shepherd,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.260
and as the Jacob and the family, as they arrive in Egypt,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.740
they come to this place,

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.040
and the Bible tells us that as they're there,

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.500
they have the best, they receive this place,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.920
but then they receive provision.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.940
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 12,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.220
and Joseph nourished, notice what it says,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.540
his father and his brethren,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.900
and all his father's household with bread,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.700
according to their families.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.700
Now, don't miss verse number 12.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.820
It's an important verse of Scripture.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.480
We find that Joseph is fulfilling a commitment

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.480
that he made back in Genesis 45, in verse number 11,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.119
after he'd revealed himself

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.680
and made his person known to his brothers,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.200
he gave them instruction, a plan to go back

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.720
and to bring the family,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.240
and he tells them in Genesis 45, 11,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.119
and there will I nourish thee,

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.040
for yet there are five years of famine,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.040
lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.240
come to poverty.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.460
And so Joseph made that commitment.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.540
He made that promise, if you will,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.340
that I will nourish you,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.100
and as we come to Genesis chapter 47,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.880
and we read verse number 12,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.800
the provision that they received,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.820
that Joseph fulfills the promise that he made.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.940
It says that he nourished his father, his brethren,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.040
and all his father's household with bread,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.900
according to their families.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.780
I know in this verse of Scripture,

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.100
not only the fulfillment of a promise

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:29.240
that Joseph made,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.840
but I know in this passage,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.360
in this verse of Scripture,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.240
I know the kindness of Joseph.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.040
The kindness of Joseph.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.640
I believe it's a great example

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.080
of the true forgiveness of an individual.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.559
We know all that Joseph had encountered

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:44.960
at the hands of his brothers.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.300
We understand the hatred of his brothers.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.080
We understand the plot to kill him

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.280
and then to sell him into slavery

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.960
and have no regard for his life whatsoever.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.800
And we understand all of those things,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.700
and we find that as Joseph is then...

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.700
and he sees his brethren, and he's filled with emotion,

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.840
and he eventually reveals himself and he says,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.960
come near.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.120
And we spoke about this in chapter 45,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.760
the picture of forgiveness,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.960
but I want you to understand this evening

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.540
that this, as we look at verse number 12 in chapter 47,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.920
how it just peels back another layer of the onion,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.080
so to speak, to help us see what true forgiveness looks like.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.300
You ever hear somebody say,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.100
I forgive him, but I don't want to see him.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.780
I forgive him, but I'm not going to talk to him.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.260
I forgive him, but you fill in the blank.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.060
No, no, Joseph, he did not just provide for his dad.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.600
Provided for his brothers.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.100
It specifically says that in verse number 12.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.100
It says, and Joseph nourished his father and his brethren.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.120
The people that when he cried out from the pit,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.960
ate a lunch and could have no care or concern whatsoever

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.820
about him being in the pit.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.860
But he nourished them.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.280
He took care of them.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.200
What a great picture of kindness and of forgiveness.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.000
Hold your place here in Genesis 47

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.040
and look in the book of Ephesians, if you will,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.380
and I want you to see what God says

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.300
about the subject of forgiveness here

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.920
in this passage of scripture in Ephesians four.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.500
It's a familiar verse of scripture,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.100
but I want you to turn that.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.920
I don't want to just quote it to you.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.700
I want you to look at it and I want you to see

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.420
and read for yourself what God says in his word

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.180
with regard to forgiveness.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.540
The Bible says in Ephesians four in verse number 32.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.060
Notice, and be kind one to another.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.380
This is a verse that we taught our kids at a young age.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.380
We helped them to memorize this verse of scripture, amen.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.660
If you have more than one child,

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.820
sometimes they like to, man, they get along great sometimes.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.060
And then other times it's like they're cats and dogs,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.260
you understand.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.260
And so we taught our kids this verse of scripture

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.260
at a young age and be kind one to another.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.580
Tenderhearted.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.460
Then notice it says this, forgiving one another.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.460
Forgiving one another.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.460
But notice, even as God, for Christ's sake,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.640
hath forgiven you.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.760
I wonder this evening, how thankful are you to be forgiven?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.740
Years ago, Julianna sang a song, Forgiven Forever.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420
Some of you might know that song.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.600
It's a precious song.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.460
It's a blessing to be forgiven by God.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.720
But you know, it's only because God is gracious

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.340
and merciful.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.480
We really don't deserve God's forgiveness.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.540
Honestly, we don't deserve it.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.920
But you know what's amazing about our God?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.160
He's ready to forgive.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.400
He's ready to forgive.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.400
He's ready to pardon.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.680
As I think about the verbage that is used

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.000
in describing the grace and mercy of our God,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.560
that he's ready to forgive.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.360
And as I've experienced the forgiveness of God in my life,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.240
as you've experienced the forgiveness of God in your life,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.820
who are we to say, nope, I'm not gonna forgive that person?

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.300
No, no, God says, forgiving one another,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.300
even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.280
What keeps us from forgiving people?

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.220
Pride.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.440
I think pride's a big part of it.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.520
You know why there's so much contention in our world?

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.360
Pride.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.360
Hatred, animosity.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.480
Obviously, we understand some of the satanic influences,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.120
which is hatred towards God and his people.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.400
But we find this evening that Joseph gives us

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.480
a beautiful picture here in Genesis 47

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.080
of what forgiveness really looks like.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.760
When his dad and his brothers come,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.800
Joseph, he doesn't just take care of his dad,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.660
he takes care of his brothers.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.120
And he takes care of their families.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.640
He fulfills a commitment.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.760
I'm thankful this evening, and many times,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.080
you look through the book of Genesis and the life of Joseph,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.240
you can see examples and typologies, if you will,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.000
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I'm thankful this evening

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.420
that our God is kind.

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:33.040
I'm thankful that he's a kind and gracious God,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.980
that he has extended kindness toward us.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.140
I'm thankful that he's forgiving.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.840
I mean, he's forgiven us.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.760
It's amazing to think that we're forgiven.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.820
We're forgiven.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.500
We sang about the blood of Jesus.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.700
And if we're not careful, we don't forgive others.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.080
Starts having this thing of bitterness in our hearts.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.840
As we're bitter, it's not gonna make you better.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.080
Someone said years ago, and I read it,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.320
and I've just kind of committed it to memory,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.160
that bitterness will destroy the vessel

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.320
in which it's stored more than the vessel

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.480
in which it's poured.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.300
You know, if you're bitter this evening over anything,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.080
towards someone, likely, it's likely, not always the case,

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.920
but likely, it's possible that that individual

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.880
that you're bitter towards doesn't even know.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.720
They're living life.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.279
They're just enjoying whatever,

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.559
and you're being eaten up and destroyed

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:44.860
because that root of bitterness will destroy.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.920
God's in order to forgive.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.920
What a great picture of the people that hurt him the most.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.480
But why was Joseph able to forgive?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.840
Because he saw God's hand.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.920
He had experienced forgiveness in his own life.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.840
He understood who God was.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.600
He speaks of various aspects of understanding

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.640
the character and nature of God,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.420
and Joseph understood that God had a plan.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.600
Again, as we referenced by way of introduction

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.400
in Genesis 45 and verse seven,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.160
that Joseph boldly proclaims to his brothers

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.960
when he reveals his identity that God sent him

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.600
to preserve you a posterity in the earth.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.360
He saw beyond his brothers, and he saw God at work.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.000
And this evening, we find that here,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.600
they receive provision.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.200
I hope that we can understand as we look

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.040
at these few thoughts and as the place

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.320
and the provision that they received

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.279
during these 17 years while they were there in Egypt.

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:50.380
I hope that we can recognize this evening

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.360
how God was working.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.760
I hope that we can recognize this evening

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.080
how many years before God sent Joseph to Egypt,

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.320
the circumstances by which God sent Joseph to Egypt

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.480
are less than desirable, admittedly.

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:07.860
Not something that I would choose,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.960
but it's how God worked it out,

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.059
and God's way is perfect.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.720
We find that God, through circumstances,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.340
again, less than desirable circumstances

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.360
that I may not choose, God allowed for Joseph

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.120
to meet the chief butler in prison

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.840
after he was falsely accused.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.840
I mean, couldn't I have met the butler some other way?

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.840
That's the way that God ordained it,

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.279
and that's the way that God allowed it.

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:42.620
We find that God gives Pharaoh a dream,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.000
and all the wise men and all of those

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.559
that would interpret that through the time

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:53.559
and life of Pharaoh, experiencing that same scenario

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.680
in previous times of his life,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.680
they were helpless to assist in this particular situation,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.300
and the butler, he remembers.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.400
There was a man that we met.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.360
It was me, and it was also the baker.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.920
I mean, the baker, he ends up dying,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.720
but while we're in prison, we both had a dream,

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.760
and there was a Hebrew, and he interpreted for us

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.160
our dreams, and it came to pass just as he said,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.760
and Pharaoh says, bring him.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.840
I mean, Joseph had to hurry up and shave himself

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.840
and clothe himself and get into the presence of Pharaoh.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.080
Not only did God allow for Joseph to interpret the dream,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.679
but God allowed for Joseph to have an understanding

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:40.160
of the steps that needed to be taken

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.760
to put a plan in place to preserve life.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.600
Why?

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.200
Because during seven years of great plenty,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.000
there's great consumption,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.919
unless you plan for the seven years of great famine.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.000
By the way, I think our land's in trouble.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:01.600
Because we've had more than seven years of great plenty,

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.119
but in the land of great plenty,

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:07.359
there's been great consumption, great consumption.

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:10.480
I read almost every week, side note,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.799
rabbit, I'm gonna kill the rabbit, I'm gonna get back, okay?

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:16.640
Side note, I read every week how that the credit card debt

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.840
amongst Americans is reaching a new milestone

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.119
every single week.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.119
It's terrible, terrible.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.480
We're in trouble.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.200
But God gave Joseph a plan.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.020
And guess what?

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.880
Pharaoh says, yeah, there's no one else as wise

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.000
as this man to do this, we're gonna put him in charge.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.520
Right, that's what God does, through using Pharaoh.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.200
And now Joseph is in this place, he's promoted,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.559
he implements the plan that God gave him,

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:48.919
and now his family comes.

00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:50.239
It's amazing.

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:52.559
20 years earlier.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.200
I'm not sure that Joseph had any idea

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.520
of what God was doing and how God was working.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.760
He didn't have any clue.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.480
The position he would have, the opportunities that he would have, but he had to live day

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:16.840
by day trusting a sovereign God to do what only God could do.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
In living in obedience.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.720
Can you imagine if at any step of the way Joseph decided, you know what, I'm done with

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.320
this.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320
This is too hard.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.760
This is not fair.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.560
You know how many people in America today say life isn't fair.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.840
Get over it already.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.080
Do you ever feel like saying that?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.120
Just get over it.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:48.640
We serve a great God and our God, he's able to do great things in our lives, but don't

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.140
give up.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.880
Don't throw in the towel.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880
Don't say it's too much.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880
I can't.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.880
It's not worth it.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.880
No, no.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.540
But it's been 20 years and here's where we're reading and here's what we're seeing God do.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.900
We see that there's a place.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.640
We see that there's provision.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.000
Notice with me as we conclude the chapter for this message, next week we'll look at

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.320
verses 13 through 27.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.540
Number three, if you're taking notes, Jacob reflects on his pilgrimage.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.020
Jacob reflects on his pilgrimage.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.300
We read in verse number seven that the Bible says,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.340
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.340
Pharaoh.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.420
And then Pharaoh says this to Jacob, How old art thou?

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.820
Jacob says to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are in a hundred and thirty

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.620
years.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.780
Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:50.060
days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.860
Jacob's 130 years old when he arrives in Egypt, according to verse number nine.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.140
Pharaoh asks the question, Jacob gives the answer.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:03.400
He says, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are in a hundred and thirty years.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.440
Notice with me in verse number 28, the Bible says this,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.300
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.580
So the whole age of Jacob was a hundred, forty, and seven years.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.260
The time drew nigh that Israel must die.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.940
That's Jacob again used interchangeably, right?

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.900
Jacob's name was turned to Israel.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.100
And so we see that the Bible says the time drew nigh that Israel must die, and he called

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:32.260
his son Joseph and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.260
thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.660
Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:42.900
But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.900
burying place.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.180
And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.140
And he did, and he said, Swear unto me, and he swore unto him, and Israel bowed himself

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.180
upon the bed's head.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:59.220
After living in Egypt for seventeen years, Jacob would die a physical death.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.820
No, his death is not actually recorded here.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.300
We're going to read in the next couple of chapters the blessings that Jacob bestows

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.780
upon the sons of Joseph in chapter 48 and his sons in chapter 49.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:14.860
But we find as a summary statement at the end of chapter 47, the time of his pilgrimage

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.220
while he was there in Egypt.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.560
So he lives for seventeen years.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.220
We don't know all that Jacob does during those seventeen years.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:26.900
We don't know of all of the interactions that took place, but we know that Jacob comes to

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.980
a place, and the Bible tells us that he is going to die.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.860
His desire is revealed.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.740
We find that his desire is to be buried in Canaan.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.380
He does not desire to be buried in Egypt.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.220
He makes this clear to Joseph, and Joseph makes a promise.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.660
He swears to him in verse number 31 with regard to the request that is made of his

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.780
father, and we find that in chapter 50, it is fulfilled.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.460
In chapter 50, in verse number 12, the Bible says this,

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:02.260
And his sons, speaking of Jacob's sons, did unto him according as he commanded them.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.300
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.500
of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for possession of a burying place of

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.860
Ephraim the Hittite before Mamrein.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.380
So we find that it was fulfilled, and we find that as we look here and see that Jacob, as

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.220
he would make this statement in verse number 9 of the days of the years of my pilgrimage

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.420
are 130 years, notice what he says.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.780
He says, few in evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.540
unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers and the days of their pilgrimage.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.060
Now we understand that verse number 9 is a very, it's a summary statement.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.660
And in that summary statement, I can't help but think of all of the thoughts that flooded

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.860
into Jacob's mind when he speaks about his pilgrimage.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.940
If someone asks you what your age is, and they begin to inquire, and you speak, and

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.500
I'm so on and so forth, here's how old I am, and you mention something about the days of

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.220
your lives, you're thinking very quickly.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.060
Our minds can process things so quickly.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.660
You think about what your life has been like.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.300
You know your life is like a vapor.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:20.380
But during that like a vapor period of time, God allows us to experience certain things.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.740
In Jacob, we find that he reflects on his pilgrimage here.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:30.580
I like the word, really it's meaning his life, but our life, it's like a pilgrimage.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.380
I think about what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11, that we're strangers and we're

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.380
pilgrims.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.580
This world is not my home.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.060
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.220
This world's not my home, I'm just passing through, amen?

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.820
My treasures are laid up, the songwriter said, somewhere beyond the blue.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.460
What a joy.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.660
I'm thankful that one day this mortal shall put on immortality, this corruption shall

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.660
put on incorruption.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.460
We're going to be changed in a moment, hallelujah.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.180
But I want you to think about Jacob for just a moment this evening as he reflects on his

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.180
pilgrimage.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.740
And yes, we can speak about the place and it was the best place and we can think about

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:13.140
the provision and how God used Joseph and how God had orchestrated some 20 years ago

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.700
all of these events to provide for his people.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.220
But then as Jacob would reflect on his pilgrimage, I would tell you this evening that at times

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.260
in your life and at times in my life, we need to reflect on our lives.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.420
We need to do some self-examination.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.460
Where have we been and where are we going?

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:38.180
If God gives us another day, another month, another year, another decade, whatever God

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.420
would choose to give us, where are we going?

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.820
What are we doing for the Lord?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.300
He reflects on his pilgrimage.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.460
I don't know what Jacob did for 17 years in Egypt.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.640
The Bible doesn't tell us.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.100
But I know that we can read many times as we study through the Scriptures where the

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.700
people of God various times will say, I don't know the time of my death.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.700
You know what?

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.500
None of us do.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:09.880
David would say there's but a step between me and death and that's true for each of us.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:15.500
We find this evening that as it is appointed unto man wants to die.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.120
But after this, the judgment.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.020
God tells Hezekiah, you're going to die.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:33.100
Unlike the preparations, Hezekiah weeps and prays and God graciously gives him 15 more

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:38.060
years but we could argue about that it was a terrible 15 years in Hezekiah's life.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.060
Really was.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.060
It was a waste.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.500
It was tragic what happened.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.300
But this evening, I don't know how many days we have left.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.700
There's two very real things.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:58.980
Number one is death is but a step or one breath from eternity.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:05.020
And number two is that the trumpet of the Lord gets out at any moment.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.780
We need to do some reflection on our pilgrimage.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.780
Where have we been?

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.780
What are we doing?

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.740
How are we impacting eternity?

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.700
Are we living for eternity?

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.660
Are we understanding that this world is not my home?

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.660
Just passing through.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.620
I'm just a pilgrim, just a stranger.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.580
I like that it says the years of my pilgrimage.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.820
Solomon would say in the book of Ecclesiastes that man goes to his long home.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.460
I know I've referenced that many times over the years.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.860
I love the terminology.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.420
Someone so adequately as they were referencing our life being like a vapor and going to our

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:46.220
long home that if you were to look at a headstone, a gravestone, a tombstone, whatever you want

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:54.340
to refer to it as, you see one date, that's a date that represents the date of birth.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:00.500
And then you see another date that represents the date of death.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:07.860
And in between those two dates, just a little dash, just a little dash, that's how many

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.860
days we have.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.020
That's what our pilgrimage is.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:20.220
Moses would say in Psalm 90 that we live our days like a tale that is told, like a story.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:28.260
I don't know when the end comes in my story or in your story, but we know about stories,

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.260
there's an ending.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.260
Amen?

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.140
There's a beginning and an ending.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:39.059
I don't know when our story is going to end, but I would say that as we look at Genesis

00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:42.179
47, we ought to reflect on our pilgrimage.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:45.739
God, what do you have for us?

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:47.619
What do you want with us?

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:52.900
If you were to give me more days, weeks, months, years, decades, how will you use me?

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.440
God, I want to be used for your honor and for your glory.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.820
This man this morning, Brother Whitfield.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.060
He told me he was going to start two churches at the same time.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.820
I said, well, that's a lot of work, how are you going to start two churches at the

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.820
same time?

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.620
He said, well, brother, and you heard his voice this morning, it's deep and it's

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.620
southern.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:19.940
He says, brother, we're going to, we believe God wants to start a church in Edinburgh,

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:25.340
and north of Edinburgh is Winchester, and south of Edinburgh is Harrisonburg, and all

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.780
of those places have a large population of Spanish people, no one's reaching them.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:35.900
He said, and so I kind of figured that we could start in Edinburgh, and we could start

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:42.500
at 8.30 in the morning on Sunday, and we can be done by around 10, 10.15, and then we can

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.300
jump in the car and we can either go north or south, depending on how God leads us, and

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.900
we could have another church service from 11 to about 12.30.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.380
Then we're going to have lunch, then we're going to have an afternoon service, then we're

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.980
going to jump in the car and we're going to go back to Edinburgh, so we can have an evening

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.980
service.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.860
And then for the midweek, we're going to do one on Wednesday, and we're going to do one

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.780
on Thursday.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.060
To God be the glory.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.660
We pray that God would give them strength to do that.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:21.940
But that's somebody that says, I want my life to amount to something.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:28.740
I want to impact eternity with my life.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.740
What a perspective.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:35.820
Jacob, he lived in Egypt for 17 years.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.340
They got a place, the best place, because they were in the will of God.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.340
Got provision.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.500
All their needs were taken care of.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:49.380
Last week, when we study what the Egyptians were doing, to have provision, and we see

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.740
and we remember the message from tonight of how God used Joseph to provide for them, absolutely

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.740
amazing.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.740
Phenomenal.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:01.060
But then he reflected on his pilgrimage.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.060
Let us take inventory.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.700
God, what are we doing?

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.180
Why are we here?

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.620
How are we impacting eternity?

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.620
I want my life to count.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.620
Let's pray.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.620
Lord, we love you.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.740
Thank you for loving us.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.460
Thank you for the privilege of being able to be in church again tonight.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.980
Thank you for the opportunity to study through this portion of Scripture, and Lord, we thank

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.580
you for the historical account, but then also the opportunity to make application in our

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.580
lives.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:36.020
And I pray, God, that you would help us to be in the center of your will, God, that we'd

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:43.500
understand that you have the best for us, as we'd follow you, submit ourselves to you.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:52.340
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to recognize that you're a good provider, you take care

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.580
of all our needs.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.820
God, help us to reflect on our lives.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.820
Our life is but a vapor.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:07.660
God, if you'd give us more days, weeks, months, years, decades, and I pray that our life would

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.900
count for eternity, that we make a difference.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:18.140
I pray, Lord, that you'd work in hearts and lives in this moment of invitation.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.460
Maybe somebody's bitter and they need to forgive.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.700
Maybe someone needs to just thank you for your provision.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.180
I'm not sure, Lord, how you would work, but I pray that you will, and we'll thank you

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.380
for what you'll do in the lives of your people.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:39.740
We pray that through all that's said and done, that you'd be glorified, which in Christ's

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.100
name we pray, would you stand with me.
