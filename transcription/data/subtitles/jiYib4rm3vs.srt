1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,359
but Psalm 119 as well.

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,960
If you would start in Psalm 119,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
hold your place in Romans one.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,539
Thankful to have some folks visiting with us this morning.

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,600
We do trust the service has already been a blessing

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,800
and will continue to be a blessing to you.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
And Psalm 119, I wanna reference a couple of verses

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
by way of introduction,

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,440
before we get into Romans chapter number one this morning,

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,799
and be looking at a few verses

11
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,600
from Romans chapter number one.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,319
You've probably heard someone make a reference

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,399
at some point in your life to a snowball effect.

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,639
You've heard somebody say that,

15
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,799
you've heard somebody use that expression.

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,520
The thought being communicated with that expression

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,159
is that one action or event

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,479
causes many other similar actions or events.

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,759
The expression can be used in a positive sense

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,119
or in a negative sense.

21
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:53,540
Personally, I've heard it used more negatively

22
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,639
than I have positively.

23
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm sure that that's the case for you as well.

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,400
When I consider the history of the nation of Israel

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,040
and I think of Judah in particular

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,279
under the time of King Ahaz's reign,

27
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,639
I think about this particular expression

28
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:11,080
with the snowball effect.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,639
And I think about the wickedness

30
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:16,559
during his reign as King of Judah.

31
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,680
And I've written in the margin of my Bible

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,959
in 2 Chronicles chapter 28,

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,000
the slippery slope of sin.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040
If you were to study through that chapter

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,760
in 2 Chronicles 28,

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,040
it will absolutely burden your heart

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,400
to see the progression of wickedness and evil

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,919
that takes place during the reign of King Ahaz,

39
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,360
no doubt a snowball effect,

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
no doubt the slippery slope of sin.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,800
I believe this morning that even as we've sung

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,440
these patriotic songs

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,319
and we have these patriotic decorations

44
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,160
and I love America.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm thankful to be an American citizen.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,120
More than being an American citizen,

47
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,879
I'm thankful that I have citizenship in heaven.

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,760
And first and foremost, I am a Christian.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,699
I am a child of God.

50
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,120
Secondly, I'm an American.

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,240
And I am so thankful as Paul speaks of

52
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,899
to the people in Philippi

53
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,520
of having our citizenship in heaven

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,399
and knowing without any shadow of a doubt,

55
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:22,919
being 100% certain that heaven is your home,

56
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,320
not because of anything that you could do,

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,880
not because of anything that I could do,

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,279
but all because of what Jesus did

59
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,639
on a cruel cross nearly 2,000 years ago.

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,940
And I'm thankful to be a Christian.

61
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm so blessed, of course, for my heavenly citizenship,

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,399
but I'm thankful to be an American.

63
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,759
But I believe this morning

64
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,839
that as we evaluate the state of our nation,

65
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,740
we must be honest.

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,339
We must acknowledge the trajectory of our nation.

67
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:53,539
As a nation, we have rejected God.

68
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:58,639
As a nation, we have rejected God.

69
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,919
And I believe that we are racing down

70
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,380
the slippery slope of sin.

71
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,660
It's no longer the case in America

72
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,580
that wickedness is simply practiced or tolerated.

73
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,199
No, today in America, wickedness is openly celebrated.

74
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,259
And I don't wanna grieve your heart

75
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,380
as it grieves my heart.

76
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,139
The reality of this reminds me

77
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,020
of what the psalmist said in Psalm 119,

78
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,380
and that's why I've asked you to turn there

79
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,800
by way of introduction.

80
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,119
In Psalm 119, the Bible speaks about

81
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,339
where the psalmist, and I believe it's representative

82
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,059
of the day in which we're living here in our nation as well,

83
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:44,259
where the people have made void the law of the Lord.

84
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:47,179
And the psalmist says in Psalm 119 in verse 126,

85
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:51,339
notice what the Bible says in Psalm 119 and 126,

86
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:56,020
it is time for thee, Lord, to work.

87
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,460
Why?

88
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,660
For they have made void thy law.

89
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,580
We live in a time in which

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,240
it's no longer just the case

91
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:10,160
that they call evil good and good evil,

92
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,380
but they legislate wickedness.

93
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,859
They've made void the law of the Lord.

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
Those of us that would claim to hold

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,920
to the truth of God's word are viewed as being bigots

96
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,359
or some other terminology that we're intolerant

97
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,480
and so on and so forth.

98
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,760
But the reality is that the impact

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,239
that this truth made on the psalmist

100
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,380
ought to be the same impact in our lives.

101
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,660
I want you to skip down to verse 136

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,739
and notice what the psalmist says.

103
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:45,619
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes.

104
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,980
Why?

105
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,940
Because they keep not thy law.

106
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,420
God has graciously given us a Bible.

107
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,059
I'm so thankful for the word of God.

108
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm so thankful that God in his grace and mercy

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,779
and his sovereign,

110
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,779
just in his sovereignty that he just gave us a Bible

111
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:11,540
and he gave us his truth and he's revealed it to us.

112
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,899
The Bible says to whom much is given, much is required.

113
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,920
And if you know anything about the history

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,619
of this great nation, you understand

115
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,019
that there was an understanding

116
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,040
of the precepts of this book.

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,859
You understand that there was an understanding

118
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,500
of the creator God.

119
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,619
There's a fear of God.

120
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:36,260
This morning, I think about the impact on the psalmist

121
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,619
when he said they have made void thy law

122
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:42,540
and he says rivers of waters run down mine eyes

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,540
because they keep not thy law.

124
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,619
I wonder how many of us are truly broken

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,420
over what we see in our society today.

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,820
So we see what's taking place in our nation today.

127
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Some unfortunately are looking to the next election cycle

128
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,619
and they think that that's where the hope

129
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,220
is going to come from and that's where we're gonna find

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,399
some level of refuge and we're gonna return to,

131
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,339
listen, this morning, I wanna submit to you

132
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,540
and you've probably already seen it

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,679
on the back of the bulletin,

134
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,540
the title for the message this morning,

135
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,320
the only hope for America is Jesus.

136
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,980
And I'll say this, that this message this morning

137
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,739
is not just a message that could be preached in America,

138
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,339
it's a message that could be preached

139
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,779
in any of the countries of the world

140
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,579
because the only hope for any people

141
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,559
is the Lord Jesus Christ.

142
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,820
That's the only hope for any people.

143
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,179
And as we look at the society in which we're living

144
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,779
and we look at all of the wickedness

145
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,980
that is taking place and being celebrated

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,059
and we understand, listen, if you're aware

147
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,339
of what's taking place in our nation today,

148
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,459
you understand they are not,

149
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,420
they're no longer concealing their agenda.

150
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,140
I've stood in this pulpit for almost 12 years now

151
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,380
as the pastor of this church

152
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,519
and I've said on more than one occasion

153
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,500
of some of the wickedness that's taking place

154
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,420
in this nation and at times people feel like

155
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,579
or they make comment as if, oh, you're just,

156
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,339
you're exaggerating it, you're just, listen, it's real.

157
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,100
They're coming for our children.

158
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,260
They've made it known.

159
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:18,619
It's absolutely ungodly what's happening in our nation.

160
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,779
But what do we do?

161
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,760
Well, we respond like the psalmist did

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,660
but then we go to Romans chapter number one.

163
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,459
In Romans chapter number one,

164
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,880
we're just gonna look at a few verses

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,540
of scripture this morning.

166
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,420
Verses 14 through 16, a precious portion

167
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,320
of the Apostle Paul giving his testimony here.

168
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,980
As we think about the Apostle Paul,

169
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,299
of course, many of us would have

170
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:46,140
a particular perspective of Paul.

171
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,779
Some would say that he's the greatest Christian

172
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,059
that's ever lived and so on and so forth

173
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,160
but what I want you to understand about the Apostle Paul

174
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,059
is that Paul was a man that was fully surrendered to God.

175
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,179
Paul was a man that was understanding

176
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,619
of his own personal salvation

177
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,660
and understanding of his own personal responsibility.

178
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,779
He was a man that just lived for God.

179
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,519
Some people say, what's the secret to Paul's success?

180
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,140
What's the secret to being used like Paul?

181
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,299
I want God to use me like Paul did.

182
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,380
You gotta be surrendered.

183
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,820
You gotta be yielded.

184
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,059
You gotta come to a place where you say,

185
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm crucified with Christ.

186
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,859
That's what Paul says in Galatians two in verse number 20.

187
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,380
You gotta come to a place where you say,

188
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,380
for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

189
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,500
My life is being lived for the Lord Jesus Christ.

190
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,419
We see Paul living that way.

191
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,140
As I think about the only hope for America is Jesus

192
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,479
and I see in this passage of scripture

193
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:50,479
some thoughts that we must take heart to this morning.

194
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,179
Notice the Bible says in Romans one in verse number 14,

195
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,900
I am debtor.

196
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,

197
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,299
both to the wise and to the unwise.

198
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,020
So as much as in me is,

199
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,219
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

200
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,059
that are at Rome also.

201
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,200
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

202
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,460
For it is the power of God unto salvation

203
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,140
to everyone that believeth.

204
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,700
To the Jew first and also to the Greek.

205
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,940
We're taking notes this morning, number one.

206
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,419
We need to embrace the personal responsibility

207
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,460
to share the gospel.

208
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,659
I would say this morning that we must embrace

209
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,400
the personal responsibility to share the gospel.

210
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,900
It's easy to look at what's going on in America

211
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,820
and to what's going on in our world

212
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,739
and to criticize and critique and to complain

213
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,640
and to get upset and to get angry.

214
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,380
It's easy to do those things.

215
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
But we must understand biblically

216
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,460
that the only hope for any people,

217
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,500
the only hope for this nation is the Lord Jesus Christ.

218
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,020
And I would say to you this morning

219
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,059
that the only hope.

220
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,219
of our nation hearing about the Lord Jesus Christ

221
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,139
as people that have been born again

222
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,999
that are the people of God.

223
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,239
For God has said that it is our responsibility,

224
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,019
those that have been saved by the blood

225
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,499
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

226
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:18,499
it is our responsibility to be his witnesses.

227
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,899
And we must embrace the personal responsibility

228
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,139
to share the gospel.

229
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,179
There's so many people,

230
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,379
there are theologians of yesteryear

231
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:29,459
that would look at the Great Commission

232
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,419
and they would try to excuse the responsibility

233
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,939
of the Great Commission by saying,

234
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:36,619
well, that was just given to the disciples.

235
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,179
I would submit to you this morning

236
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,059
that Paul was not there

237
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,779
when the Lord Jesus Christ gave the Great Commission.

238
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,379
In fact, at the time in which the Lord Jesus Christ

239
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,739
gave the Great Commission,

240
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,979
Saul was not a believer.

241
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,979
If you trace the history and you trace what's taking place,

242
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,819
no doubt Saul was alive when Jesus was crucified,

243
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,959
he was there and maybe not there when it took place,

244
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,379
but he was aware of the life

245
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,180
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

246
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,979
But Saul did not get saved

247
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,860
until well after the ascension of Jesus Christ.

248
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,099
He was not there when Jesus gave the Great Commission.

249
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:16,659
Yet Paul says, after he's been saved,

250
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,699
Acts chapter number nine, his life is transformed,

251
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,299
he knows that he's heaven bound,

252
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,860
he says, I am debtor.

253
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,259
Personal responsibility.

254
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,579
So all of those that try to

255
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,500
remove themselves from the responsibility

256
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,099
of sharing the Great Commission,

257
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:37,819
sharing the gospel because they say,

258
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:40,239
well, that was just for the disciples.

259
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,099
You got a real problem with Romans chapter number one

260
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,819
in verse 14.

261
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,379
Because Paul says, I am debtor.

262
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,299
Do you see the personal aspect of it?

263
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,699
Paul is saying, I, personally.

264
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,459
He's not, at this point,

265
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,180
as he's addressing these believers in Rome,

266
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,059
he's not simply saying to them,

267
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,500
it's your responsibility to preach the gospel.

268
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,939
He's saying, I am debtor.

269
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,099
I have this debt, I have this responsibility,

270
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,459
and he's owning it.

271
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,699
We find that Jesus has left us

272
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,699
as his people responsible to make him known.

273
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,020
Look over in Acts chapter 17, if you will.

274
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,500
In Acts chapter number 17,

275
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,979
I often think of this portion of scripture

276
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,339
after the apostle Paul has been on missionary journeys

277
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,220
and after the work that's gone on

278
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,080
and all the things that are taking place,

279
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,059
and just, I mean, he's suffered so greatly

280
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,380
and all of these just adversities

281
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,419
that have come in his life.

282
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,539
And there in Thessalonica, Berea,

283
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,779
the work that's taking place

284
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,940
at the beginning of Acts chapter number 17,

285
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,300
we find that Paul is then kind of sent away

286
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,819
because the enemy is relentless

287
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,660
and the people are stirred up against him.

288
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,779
And the Bible tells us in verse number 16

289
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,059
that Paul waited for them at Athens,

290
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,139
but the Bible says that his spirit was stirred in him.

291
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:57,979
Why?

292
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:01,580
Because he saw the city was wholly given to idolatry.

293
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,739
And Paul, in this position in which

294
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,300
maybe we would say it this way,

295
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,099
he was getting a little R&R

296
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:12,220
and his ministry had been taxing

297
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,459
and all these adversities that have taken place,

298
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,860
and they've sent Paul to Athens

299
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,459
and you wait for us there,

300
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,959
but yet Paul, because he sees a city

301
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,099
that's wholly given to idolatry,

302
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,699
his spirit is stirred within him.

303
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,220
Now here's the real matter of Acts chapter number 17.

304
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,059
It's possible this morning

305
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,440
for us to be stirred up and do nothing.

306
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,580
It's possible that we could sit in a church service,

307
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,899
that we could hear the preaching of God's word,

308
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,300
that we could go to some special meeting

309
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,459
at some church somewhere,

310
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,699
go to some conference and hear preaching

311
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,380
and get stirred up and do nothing.

312
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,940
But Paul is stirred up and he does something about it.

313
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,860
The stirring in Acts 17 in Paul's life

314
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,300
brings him to action.

315
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,339
And if you skip down to verse number 23,

316
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,220
we won't spend time looking at all of the message,

317
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,619
but I want you to know what he says in verse 23.

318
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:09,239
He says this to these people there in Athens.

319
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,080
He says,

320
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,619
for as I passed by and beheld your devotions,

321
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,299
I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God,

322
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,779
whom therefore ye ignorantly worship.

323
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:19,859
Notice what he says,

324
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,019
him declare I unto you.

325
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:24,859
Paul says,

326
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,619
I have a personal responsibility

327
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,419
and I'm gonna make him known.

328
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,260
Why is he,

329
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,299
why Paul do you feel this need?

330
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,139
Because he says,

331
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,419
I am debtor in Romans one.

332
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,260
This was the perspective that Paul had in his life.

333
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,079
He understood that he had been given

334
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,660
this great responsibility.

335
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,940
In first Corinthians one in verse 17,

336
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,779
he says,

337
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,459
for Christ sent me not to baptize,

338
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,059
but to preach the gospel,

339
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,440
not with wisdom of words,

340
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,260
lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

341
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,700
Why Paul,

342
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,600
as he enters into Corinth and listen,

343
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,899
there are many adversaries,

344
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,919
but God says,

345
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,779
I have much people in this city.

346
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,139
So what God tells Paul when he's going to enter into Corinth

347
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,839
and Paul goes there and he says,

348
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,679
listen,

349
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,559
God sent me to preach the gospel.

350
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,399
Why?

351
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,980
Because Corinth needed the gospel.

352
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,899
Because the only hope for Corinth was Jesus.

353
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,239
Corinth was a wicked place.

354
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,459
If you study history

355
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,260
and we don't have time to deal with it this morning,

356
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,859
but if you study the history of Corinth and that city,

357
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,019
the wickedness and all of those things

358
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,739
and God sends Paul in there to preach Christ.

359
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,700
And he preached with boldness

360
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,380
and a church was established

361
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,179
and souls were saved

362
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,339
and lives were changed.

363
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,100
But Paul said this in the same book

364
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,179
of first Corinthians chapter nine,

365
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,540
speaking about this,

366
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,660
embracing the personal responsibility

367
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,899
to share the gospel

368
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,779
in first Corinthians nine in verse 16,

369
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,619
Paul says this,

370
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,839
for though I preach the gospel,

371
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,419
I have nothing to glory of

372
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,579
for necessity is laid upon me,

373
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:02,419
yea,

374
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,480
woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.

375
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,619
I wonder this morning,

376
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,500
as we look at the example of the apostle Paul

377
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,100
and this first thought

378
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,579
of embracing the personal responsibility

379
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,839
to share the gospel,

380
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,480
I wonder this morning how many of us

381
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,019
really have that perspective

382
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,859
of first Corinthians nine and 16

383
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:23,700
where we would say,

384
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,500
woe is me if I preach not the gospel.

385
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,980
I wonder this morning how much desire is in us

386
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,940
to be able to share the gospel with people.

387
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,380
I wonder this morning how ready we are

388
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,899
to share the gospel with individuals.

389
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,739
Why?

390
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,559
Because we know what it is.

391
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,839
We know the power of it.

392
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,679
And we understand that Paul has embraced

393
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,559
the personal responsibility

394
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,720
and therefore it leads us

395
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,480
to our second thought this morning

396
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,320
that we must engage in the work

397
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,660
of personal evangelism.

398
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,500
See,

399
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,040
I will not engage in the work

400
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,399
of personal evangelism

401
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,959
until I first embrace the personal responsibility.

402
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,000
If I do not think it's a responsibility that's mine,

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
then I'm not going to engage in the work.

404
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,679
But Paul begins this great passage of scripture

405
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,179
in Romans 1, 14 through 16

406
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,320
by saying first of all,

407
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,119
I am debtor.

408
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,100
And because of that recognition

409
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,119
of his personal responsibility,

410
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,899
it leads him to engage in the work

411
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:26,359
of personal evangelism

412
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,239
where the Bible says this in verse 15

413
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,639
back in Romans one,

414
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:33,839
so as much as in me is,

415
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,820
I am ready to preach the gospel

416
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,660
to you that are at Rome also.

417
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,859
And I love how Paul says I'm ready.

418
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,700
I believe that Paul was prepared.

419
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,380
It carries with it that idea,

420
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,059
we speak of Ezra in the Old Testament

421
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,579
of being a ready scribe,

422
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,059
an individual that had prepared himself

423
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,619
for the ministry that God would give him.

424
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,700
And because he was a ready scribe,

425
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,059
because he was prepared,

426
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,739
God opened doors of opportunity for Ezra.

427
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,540
And here Paul says I'm ready,

428
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,619
I'm prepared.

429
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,579
I'm ready for this.

430
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,059
And we find that he says I'm ready to do what?

431
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,339
He's ready to preach the gospel.

432
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,820
And we must understand this morning

433
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,940
that when we engage in the work

434
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,419
of personal evangelism,

435
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:20,519
that the gospel is absolutely essential.

436
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,500
And we cannot lose sight of what the gospel is.

437
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,639
According to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15,

438
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,059
the gospel very simply defined

439
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,059
is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

440
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,380
But understand that as we preach the gospel,

441
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
that there has to be some understanding

442
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,659
as to why Jesus had to die.

443
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,619
When we just simply begin with the fact

444
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,500
that Christ died on a cruel cross

445
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,020
nearly 2,000 years ago,

446
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,640
we must answer the question why did he die?

447
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,679
He died because we're sinners.

448
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,580
And he died because sin requires a payment.

449
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,760
There's a penalty.

450
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,419
And yes, we must deal with

451
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,260
and we must acknowledge the fact

452
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,820
that God so loved the world

453
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,260
and I'm thankful for God's love.

454
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,640
But even as we dealt with in Sunday school this morning,

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,880
we must acknowledge the fact that God is just.

456
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,179
And the reality is that God,

457
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,659
because of man's sin,

458
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,460
Jesus, God in flesh,

459
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,900
had to go to that cruel cross

460
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,500
because a payment had to be made.

461
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,739
So when we share the gospel,

462
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:34,840
the gospel, listen, it doesn't start out real positive.

463
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,140
Why do I say that?

464
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,380
Because it starts out by saying you're a sinner.

465
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,539
And because of your sin, there's a penalty.

466
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,500
You know what the message is of the Bible?

467
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,619
Repent!

468
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,039
Why?

469
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,419
Because your sin

470
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,159
is gonna send you to the lake of fire.

471
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,739
For the Bible says the wages of sin

472
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,639
is death.

473
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,239
And so a pastor, that's not very popular.

474
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,299
I understand that.

475
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,399
Truth is becoming less and less popular in our day.

476
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:14,359
But nonetheless, the truth of God's word must be proclaimed.

477
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,239
It is not sufficient that we can simply say

478
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,799
that people, well, you know, just do the best you can

479
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,919
and be the best you can

480
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,759
and just everything's gonna work out okay.

481
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,479
You know why I can't say that?

482
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,239
Because the Bible doesn't say that.

483
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,159
I preached a funeral on Tuesday.

484
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,399
I don't know the family.

485
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,679
It was a unique situation.

486
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,279
I was called upon simply because I pastor a church

487
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,519
to preach a funeral.

488
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,299
I don't know anything about the family whatsoever.

489
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:48,559
Very brief interactions before the funeral.

490
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,439
To the best of my knowledge,

491
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:54,159
the deceased had not trusted Christ as their savior.

492
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,839
That's a difficult situation.

493
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,079
And I believe that mostly what the family wanted to hear

494
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,559
was for somebody to stand up and say,

495
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,159
your loved one is in heaven.

496
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,359
I couldn't say that.

497
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,519
I could simply talk about the hope I have of heaven.

498
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,119
The reality that one day I will see my savior face to face.

499
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,399
I did not stand there

500
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,399
and say anything negative about the deceased.

501
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,519
I didn't think that would be appropriate.

502
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,399
I don't know them.

503
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,579
I simply shared my testimony.

504
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,839
And the reality this morning

505
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,439
is that when we think about this engaging

506
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,879
in the work of personal evangelism,

507
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:37,079
it requires that we share the gospel.

508
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,639
It requires, listen,

509
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:41,799
personal evangelism is confrontational.

510
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,599
It's personal.

511
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,199
I'm all for giving gospel tracts.

512
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,559
I use them all the time.

513
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,439
But understand that giving a gospel tract

514
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,159
is not the same as engaging in personal evangelism.

515
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,899
We hang door hangers and I'm for it,

516
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,479
but it's not the same as knocking a door

517
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,659
and confronting somebody about their need

518
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,399
for the Lord Jesus Christ.

519
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,279
This morning, I'm thankful that there are videos

520
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,419
that you can send people to and so on and so forth,

521
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,119
but I would submit to you this morning

522
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,379
that none of those things are as powerful as this book.

523
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,999
What happened when the rich man died?

524
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,479
He's in hell.

525
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,059
And he says, would you send Lazarus

526
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:24,799
to relieve me of some of this misery

527
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:26,559
and it cannot be done.

528
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,679
And so what's the request of the rich man?

529
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,679
Send Lazarus back to my brothers.

530
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,159
Why?

531
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,359
Because my brothers are gonna die

532
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,539
and come to this place as well.

533
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,559
And I don't want them to.

534
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,559
Is that not Luke 16?

535
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,179
And guess what the response to that rich man is.

536
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:51,899
They have Moses and the prophets.

537
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,979
If they don't believe them,

538
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:59,999
they're not gonna believe the one rose from the dead.

539
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,659
One came, Lazarus, to them.

540
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,899
What's he telling us?

541
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:07,779
He's telling us the sufficiency of this book.

542
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,259
So many people, oh, if I could just see a vision.

543
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,619
Oh, if I could just have a dream.

544
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:12,779
Oh, if I could just this.

545
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,979
Oh, if I could just that.

546
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,019
God's word.

547
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,059
God's word.

548
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,719
You say, well, there's this video

549
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,879
or there's this series or there's this whatever.

550
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:27,199
Personal evangelism requires preaching the word of God.

551
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,179
Plain and simple.

552
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,079
Sometimes I think we complicate it.

553
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,679
It's actually not very complicated.

554
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,199
The gospel's simple.

555
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,899
The gospel is powerful.

556
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,719
I'll read a couple of verses to you.

557
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,519
You don't need to turn there for sake of time.

558
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,079
But here in the same book of Romans

559
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,279
in the 15th chapter, Paul says this.

560
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,519
We talk about engaging the work of personal evangelism.

561
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,979
In Romans 15 in verse number 19,

562
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:07,959
he said there in verse number 15, I am ready.

563
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,579
He says in verse 16, I am not ashamed.

564
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:14,479
Notice what he says in Romans 15 in verse 19.

565
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,139
Through mighty signs and wonders

566
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,319
by the power of the spirit of God

567
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,079
so that from Jerusalem and round about

568
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,079
unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

569
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,799
That's a great testimony.

570
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,279
Paul didn't simply make the statement

571
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
of I'm dead and I'm ready and I'm not ashamed.

572
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,039
He actually went and engaged in personal evangelism.

573
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,440
He embraced that personal responsibility.

574
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,359
And again, until we embrace that personal responsibility,

575
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,639
we will not engage in the work.

576
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:45,479
But the hope for America is Jesus.

577
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,079
Who's gonna tell him about Jesus?

578
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,720
It's gotta be somebody that knows Jesus.

579
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:55,059
The Jesus of the Bible.

580
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,160
The Jesus of the Bible.

581
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:01,199
Listen, Hollywood's not gonna tell him about Jesus.

582
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,679
It's not.

583
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm not waiting for Congress to tell people about Jesus.

584
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,160
They're the ones that remove prayer.

585
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,799
They're the ones that remove, 10 Commandments, right?

586
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,359
I know it wasn't in this era,

587
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,359
but for some of you, it was in your era.

588
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,279
I'm not waiting on Congress, it's the church.

589
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,519
It's God's people.

590
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,979
Paul said this in Acts 20 and verse 31.

591
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,359
I referenced this passage of scripture last week

592
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,839
and Sunday evening, but I wanna read again

593
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,239
this verse of scripture with regard to the content

594
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,099
of this message this morning in Acts 20 and verse 31.

595
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,959
The Bible says that Paul makes this statement

596
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:50,359
to these church leaders of the church at Ephesus

597
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,359
in verse 31, therefore watch and remember

598
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,160
that by the space of three years,

599
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

600
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,279
Paul, why were you so concerned about this?

601
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,720
Why were you engaging people night and day with tears?

602
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,599
Why is it that you would say that you cease not

603
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,359
to warn everyone night and day?

604
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,160
Well, because Paul understood that everyone's gonna die.

605
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,239
Everyone's gonna die.

606
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,919
I don't know when I'm gonna die.

607
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,559
You don't know when you're gonna die,

608
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,160
but everyone of us is gonna die.

609
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,319
Where are we gonna go?

610
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,919
This morning, I'm thankful that I know for sure,

611
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,519
100% certainty that I'm going to heaven when I die.

612
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,619
Not because I'm a good person,

613
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:37,000
not because I pastor a church,

614
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,679
not because I put money in the offering plate,

615
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,039
not because I, because Jesus Christ died for me.

616
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,759
And he paid a debt that I could not pay.

617
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:52,639
And I recognized on a day in August of 1997

618
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:58,959
that I was a sinner on my way to a Christless eternity

619
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,839
in the Lake of Fire,

620
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,479
separated from God for all of eternity,

621
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:06,359
justly because of my sin.

622
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,039
I was guilty.

623
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,000
Listen, people today, well, I'm really not that bad.

624
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,319
Listen, you're guilty.

625
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,880
You're guilty.

626
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,500
But he loved me and he died for me.

627
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,380
And I simply accepted him as my savior.

628
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,239
And this transaction took place

629
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,880
that I can't even still today fully understand,

630
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,919
where he took my sin and gave me his righteousness.

631
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,479
It's unbelievable, but it's true.

632
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:43,399
I just said it's unbelievable,

633
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,160
and as I said it, I said I shouldn't have said it that way.

634
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Why?

635
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,959
It would be unbelievable except for the fact

636
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,959
that God told us in his word.

637
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,519
And it's absolutely believable

638
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,359
because let God be true and every man a liar.

639
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,440
In fact, Paul says it this way

640
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,880
with regard to this very subject in Titus chapter number one

641
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,119
when he's speaking about this truth of God and salvation.

642
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,639
He says, in hope of eternal life,

643
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:12,639
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

644
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,139
I'm so thankful.

645
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,919
This morning, we need to embrace

646
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,440
the personal responsibility to share the gospel.

647
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,599
Number two, we must engage

648
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,959
in the work of personal evangelism.

649
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,199
And I would say this, number three,

650
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,880
we must expect God to work.

651
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
Must expect God to work.

652
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,399
See, in verse 16 of Romans chapter number one,

653
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,679
Paul says I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

654
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,520
Why?

655
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,000
He says for it is the power of God unto salvation

656
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,359
to everyone that believe it,

657
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,380
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

658
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:55,760
Listen, though we're nearly 2,000 years

659
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,599
past the death of Christ and the resurrection

660
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,959
and the ascension of Christ

661
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,260
and the New Testament church going forward,

662
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,599
listen, the plan of God,

663
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,320
the gospel message cannot be improved on.

664
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,760
He said we're in 2023.

665
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,679
It cannot be improved on.

666
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,039
The gospel then and the gospel today

667
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,419
is the power of God unto salvation.

668
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,799
And Paul believed that.

669
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,719
And so Paul, as he embraced this personal responsibility

670
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,119
and then engaged in personal evangelism,

671
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,000
I believe that Paul expected God to work.

672
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,839
Missionary of yesteryear said expect great things from God

673
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,700
but attempt great things for God.

674
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,479
As we attempt great things for God,

675
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,359
we're expecting that God's going to work.

676
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,599
God said that he's not willing that any should perish

677
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,679
but that all should come to repentance.

678
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,439
You're praying for that loved one.

679
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:04,079
You're engaging that neighbor,

680
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,079
that coworker with the gospel.

681
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,659
You're talking to that individual

682
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:10,639
and you're expecting God to work.

683
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:11,659
I've had people say, Pastor,

684
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,639
I just want him to be saved so much, not more than God.

685
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:19,159
And I understand how much we want our loved ones to be saved

686
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:22,379
but God said he's not willing that any should perish

687
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:23,999
but that all should come to repentance

688
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,519
and we expect God to work.

689
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,919
Now listen, God will not overpower our own free will.

690
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,839
God has chosen that he created man with a free will

691
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,059
and they have choice.

692
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:39,599
They have the responsibility to respond to that invitation

693
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,079
that was extended to that free gift offer of eternal life

694
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,359
and someone can say, no, I'm okay,

695
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,999
I'm gonna just do it my way

696
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:50,279
and they can reject that gift or they can receive that gift

697
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,699
and that is outside of our ability to do anything about.

698
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,639
But at some point,

699
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,039
your neighbors and your coworkers and my neighbors

700
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,279
and I can't say my coworkers

701
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,239
because Holly is my only coworker and she's saved, amen,

702
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,459
but those that I come into contact with,

703
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,919
they need to hear the truth of the gospel

704
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,559
and they need to be given an opportunity

705
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,479
to respond to the gospel.

706
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,899
What are you gonna do with Jesus?

707
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,399
Are you gonna trust him or are you gonna reject him?

708
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:29,799
Paul expected that God would work.

709
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:34,799
1 Timothy 1 and verse 15, Paul made this statement.

710
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,919
I mentioned by way of introduction that some would say

711
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,119
that Paul was the greatest of all Christians

712
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,579
and he says of himself that he is the chief of all sinners.

713
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,599
By the way, another clue as to why God used Paul

714
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,999
the way that he did.

715
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,799
He was a humble servant of the Lord.

716
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,159
But in 1 Timothy 1 and verse 14,

717
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,479
the Bible says in the grace of our Lord

718
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,879
was exceeding abundant with faith and love

719
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,999
which is in Christ Jesus.

720
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,959
So thankful for God's grace.

721
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,839
Then Paul says this in verse 15 of 1 Timothy 1,

722
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,239
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

723
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:16,559
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

724
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,839
of whom I am chief.

725
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,839
The Bible says, Jesus says this,

726
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,879
I came to seek and to save.

727
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,839
We see Jesus interacting as you study the gospel records

728
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,199
and you see how that he purposefully interacted

729
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:34,479
and traveled and went to certain places

730
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:38,239
as he was seeking sinners in need of salvation.

731
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,719
We find that there, as you read the fourth chapter

732
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,559
of the book of John, he says,

733
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,759
I must needs go through Samaria.

734
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,839
And he meets the woman at the well.

735
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,159
What a great passage of scripture.

736
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,199
That lady was saved.

737
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,519
And many of the Samaritans were saved as well.

738
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,279
We find here this morning that Paul testifies

739
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,639
as he's encouraging his son in the faith, Timothy,

740
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:08,679
that listen, understand that Christ Jesus

741
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:09,799
came into the world to save sinners.

742
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,639
Guess what?

743
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,639
He's still saving sinners.

744
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:14,399
We need to expect God to work.

745
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,079
In verse number four of chapter two,

746
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,099
just a few verses past verse 15 there.

747
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,719
I know that it's another chapter,

748
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,159
but notice it says in verse four,

749
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,279
who will have all men to be saved

750
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,559
and come under the knowledge of the truth.

751
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,679
He's able to save to the uttermost,

752
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,759
the Bible tells us in Hebrews seven and verse 25.

753
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,679
I'm reminded of the principle,

754
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:38,039
the promise that I've already mentioned

755
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,039
from second Peter three and verse number nine,

756
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,239
where the Bible says that he's not willing

757
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,439
that any should perish,

758
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,519
but that all should come to repentance.

759
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,919
And we expect God to work.

760
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,239
Turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will.

761
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,279
Let me use this Old Testament passage

762
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,159
and consider with me this morning

763
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,159
as we make New Testament application

764
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,519
in Isaiah chapter number one,

765
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,319
and then we'll look at another passage here

766
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,319
in just a moment in the book of Isaiah.

767
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,819
Remember what the psalmist said

768
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:08,519
as we started by way of introduction

769
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,839
this morning to our message in Psalm 119

770
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,959
and verse number 126.

771
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,159
It is time for thee, Lord, to what?

772
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,199
To work, for they've made void thy law.

773
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,559
And I'm expecting God to work as we preach the gospel.

774
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,759
Listen, it's not your gospel, it's not my gospel,

775
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,000
it's his gospel.

776
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,179
If you're trying to get a group of people to follow you,

777
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,119
if I'm trying to get a group of people to follow me,

778
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,639
it's just gonna fall.

779
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,119
I'm pointing people to Jesus.

780
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,820
The only hope for our nation is Jesus.

781
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:46,220
Notice in Isaiah one, the Bible says this in verse 18.

782
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord.

783
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:55,339
Though your sins be as scarlet, notice what he says,

784
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,500
they shall be as white as snow.

785
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:03,419
Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

786
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:06,179
Isn't that a blessed truth, a blessed promise?

787
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,660
Yeah.

788
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,600
Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.

789
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,299
But notice the response, it says this in verse 19.

790
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:17,539
If ye be willing and obedient,

791
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,059
you shall eat the good of the land.

792
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,339
But if you refuse and rebel,

793
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,859
you shall be devoured with the sword,

794
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,699
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

795
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:26,139
Now understand this morning as we make application

796
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,619
from this text of scripture,

797
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,899
as we understand Israel and what's happening

798
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:32,380
and so on and so forth with Isaiah's and his prophecy

799
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,419
and the land and so on and so forth.

800
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:35,979
But we understand this morning

801
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:37,859
that when we speak about the gospel

802
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,339
that Jesus is saying to people, come,

803
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,419
come, the invitation of the book of Revelation, come.

804
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,859
Though your sins be as scarlet,

805
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,320
they shall be white as snow.

806
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,979
Again, it's that transaction that takes place.

807
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:56,979
How many of you ever heard that song?

808
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,539
I don't think it's in our song book, maybe it is.

809
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:01,179
The old account was settled long ago.

810
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,220
And I love that song.

811
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,579
Long ago where, down at the cross.

812
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,739
I said it all long ago.

813
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:10,559
There's a great transaction that took place.

814
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,940
There has to be a recognition of guilt.

815
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,779
I'm a sinner.

816
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,139
And we expect God to work because it's the power of God

817
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,220
unto salvation, what is the gospel?

818
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,899
Notice what he says in Isaiah 59.

819
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:34,899
Isaiah 59, again, we understand the historical context.

820
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,839
But I want you to understand the application as well.

821
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:50,179
From Isaiah 59, in verse number one.

822
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,299
Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened

823
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,359
that it cannot save.

824
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,639
Neither is your heavy that it cannot hear.

825
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:04,440
Aren't you thankful that he's able to save?

826
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,279
He's able to save.

827
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,859
Notice verse two.

828
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,160
But your iniquities have separated between you and your God

829
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,940
and your sins have hid his face from you

830
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,720
that he will not hear.

831
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,279
Listen, understand this morning

832
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:18,119
that sinners are separated from God.

833
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,839
At enmity with God.

834
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,739
But God loved us.

835
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,079
He died for us.

836
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,519
But God commended his love toward us

837
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:32,000
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

838
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,440
And we expect that as we preach that message

839
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,160
that God will work.

840
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,600
What is God gonna do?

841
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,239
He's gonna save people.

842
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,639
What does it mean to be saved, to be born again?

843
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:46,279
To be heaven bound, to understand

844
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,199
that our citizenship is in heaven.

845
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,479
To know, as Paul said, to be absent from the body

846
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,199
is to be present with the Lord.

847
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,399
I mean, with 100% confidence and certainty,

848
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:01,220
knowing that heaven is your home.

849
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,059
Why?

850
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,419
Because you're born again.

851
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,880
But what does he do in our lives?

852
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,600
Well, the Bible says that if any man be in Christ,

853
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,239
Joseph said that that man in Scotland

854
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,839
reminds the missionary every time he comes to church,

855
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,919
I'm a new creature.

856
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,279
Right, is that what he said?

857
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,679
Why does he say that?

858
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,679
Because the Bible says,

859
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,399
in 2 Corinthians 5, verse number 17,

860
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:34,520
if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

861
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,739
Old things are passed away,

862
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,640
behold, all things are become new.

863
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,440
Listen, God begins to do a work in us.

864
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,039
The Holy Spirit indwells us

865
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,399
and God begins to do a work in us.

866
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:46,119
It's amazing what God does in us.

867
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:46,960
Listen, there are people that say,

868
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,559
well, I gotta get cleaned up in order to come to Christ.

869
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,359
No, you can't get cleaned up to come to Christ.

870
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:54,559
You come to Christ because you're dirty.

871
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,440
You come to Christ because you're a sinner

872
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,200
and you need the Savior, amen.

873
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,719
Someone used this analogy, I heard it not long ago,

874
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,919
that you don't get cleaned up before you get a shower.

875
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,820
You get a shower because you're dirty.

876
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,919
This morning, we're expecting God to work

877
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:15,559
and to transform people.

878
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,919
It's amazing the work that God does

879
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:22,479
in the heart of his children as they're made alive.

880
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:27,399
They're quickened, they're born again, they're saved.

881
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,719
God does a work.

882
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,200
Listen, I don't know, it's 25 years ago,

883
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,419
almost 26 years ago, now I trust that Christ is my Savior.

884
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,039
Just another six weeks or so, it'll be 26 years.

885
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,580
God changed my life.

886
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,159
He did a work in my life.

887
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,559
He's still doing a work in my life.

888
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,000
We sing the song with the Sunday school kids,

889
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,919
God's still working on me.

890
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,200
He made all the creation, the sun, the moon,

891
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,960
the stars in six days, but he's still working on me

892
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,779
and how gracious and merciful he is indeed

893
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,520
that he's still working on us.

894
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
But man, He changes us.

895
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
We sing the song, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

896
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Why?

897
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,320
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

898
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,400
It's a constant battle.

899
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,720
It's a daily struggle that we're going to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill

900
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,120
the lust of the flesh, but we see that God transforms us.

901
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,800
Listen, when God saves an individual, He doesn't leave them like they were.

902
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,120
He will take you just as you are, and I'm thankful for that.

903
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,200
He will accept you just as you are, but He doesn't leave you just like you were.

904
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,120
He changes you.

905
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,520
He changes you.

906
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,640
I don't think the same way anymore.

907
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I don't do the same things anymore.

908
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Why?

909
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,400
Because I'm a child of God.

910
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,920
The Holy Spirit of God lives within me.

911
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,800
How many of you that, you don't need to raise your hand, but since you got saved, the Holy

912
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,040
Spirit convicts you.

913
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,720
It's a good thing when He convicts you.

914
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,520
I won't tell you the exact details, but I was convicted this week.

915
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,080
How many of you ever get in a situation, you say something, and you say, I shouldn't have

916
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,480
said that.

917
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,960
I'm human just like you are, and that happened this week in my life, and I said something

918
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,360
that just wasn't very kind.

919
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,280
God's convicted me on that.

920
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Why?

921
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Why?

922
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Because I'm a new creature now.

923
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,040
God says, that wasn't right behavior.

924
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,960
You say, really, just because of a word that you said?

925
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah.

926
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah.

927
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,080
God changes us.

928
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,680
This morning, we look at our beloved nation, and we see all the things that are taking

929
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
place.

930
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Listen, I watch the news.

931
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,280
I see things just like you do.

932
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,880
We see the state of the church.

933
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:02,960
By and large, the state of the church is embarrassing, honestly, embarrassing.

934
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:11,600
They have forsooken this book, most of them, mainstream Christianity in America.

935
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,200
They've just walked away from God's Word.

936
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,280
Well, you know, it's 2023, and things are different now, and we should be able to do

937
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,920
this, and we should be able to do that, and this is okay.

938
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:35,480
The eternal holy God gave us a book that transcends time.

939
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:42,240
If He said it was wrong 2,000 years ago, it's still wrong today.

940
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,200
It's pretty simple.

941
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm not the authority, and neither are you.

942
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,240
God is in His Word.

943
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,520
What do we do in our nation?

944
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
What's the hope for our nation?

945
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,840
Well, did you see who's running for?

946
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,920
No, no, no.

947
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,920
It's not an election.

948
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,400
That's not the hope for our nation.

949
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,720
The only hope for America is Jesus.

950
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,920
That's the only hope for our nation, and the only hope for your neighbors, your co-workers,

951
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,120
my neighbors, those people that I interact with, to hear about Jesus is if I open my

952
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,520
mouth and if you open your mouth and you tell them.

953
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,920
God's given us that personal responsibility, and I hope this morning, as we think about

954
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,600
our nation, and we can complain, we can sit around for days and complain about what's

955
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
going on in our nation.

956
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,520
We really could, but I wonder this morning how many of us are going to embrace the personal

957
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,120
responsibility and say, as Paul said, I am debtor?

958
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,160
How many of us are going to engage in personal evangelism and say, I am ready to preach the

959
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,320
gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection?

960
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,880
Why did Christ have to die?

961
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,600
Because you're a sinner, and I'm a sinner.

962
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,040
He paid the price that He did not owe, that I could not pay, because He loved me, and

963
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,200
He loves you.

964
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,880
And then we expect God to work.

965
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,680
Listen, Holly planted some seeds this year for a garden.

966
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,840
Some of you start a garden with plants, some start with seeds.

967
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,000
Last year, we just went to the nursery and bought some plants and planted them in the

968
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
garden.

969
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,200
And this year, Holly said, I'm going to start with seeds.

970
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,000
And I said, honey, it's really easy to just go to the nursery and buy the plants.

971
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,920
She said, no, we got this big window, and I'm going to put these, and she started them

972
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,600
in an egg crate, just a little bit of soil, seeds.

973
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,800
She watered them.

974
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,240
Then she put them into little cups.

975
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Why did she do that?

976
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,440
Well, she expected something to happen.

977
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,160
She didn't do it because she was bored and she had nothing else to do.

978
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,960
She had an expectation.

979
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
And guess what we were talking yesterday?

980
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:15,400
She said, do you see all the flowers on the plants outside?

981
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:22,040
One day soon, I'm going to eat a tomato sandwich with a tomato from my garden.

982
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,160
Why?

983
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Because there was an expectation that something was going to happen when that seed was put

984
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,880
in that soil, in the sunlight, with water.

985
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,960
That growth would take place.

986
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:44,480
That fruit would be produced.

987
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,880
We need to expect God to work.

988
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,360
God's not done.

989
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,480
If God was done saving people, He'd have done the trumpet of the Lord would sound and we'd

990
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,520
be home.

991
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,600
Hallelujah.

992
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,560
So He hasn't done that yet.

993
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,120
So that means we have a job to do.

994
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
We need to expect God to work.

995
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Let's pray.

996
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,920
Father, we love you.

997
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,440
We thank you for loving us.

998
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,400
Thank you for the testimony of the Apostle Paul.

999
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,160
Thank you for his work, his ministry.

1000
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,200
I thank you for the opportunity that we have this morning that we could look at a passage

1001
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,400
of Scripture such as this and make application even to our own nation, to any nation on the

1002
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
globe today.

1003
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,280
The only hope for people is Jesus.

1004
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,760
God, if there's one that's present here at this property that's not sure of heaven, they

1005
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,520
heard much today about salvation, about being born again, about going to heaven, but if

1006
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,920
they'd be honest in their lives and they say, you know, I really hope that I go to heaven

1007
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,000
one day, but I'm just not sure, God, I pray that they'd come to this old-fashioned altar.

1008
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
We'd have an opportunity to open a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that

1009
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,160
heaven's their home.

1010
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,360
Maybe somebody that's tuned in via live stream this morning, not sure of heaven, God, I pray

1011
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,440
they wouldn't just click off and be done, God, I pray they'd be saved.

1012
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,880
Lord, I know the personal testimony of many that are gathered here this morning that we've

1013
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,440
been born again, we've been saved.

1014
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,320
I pray that this message would not only stir us, but I pray, God, that it would change

1015
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:41,080
us, that we'd be stirred to action as Paul was in Acts 17.

1016
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:49,160
I pray, God, that you would use us to engage in the work of personal evangelism, that we'd

1017
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:56,760
expect you to work, that we'd not get discouraged by the adversity that we'll face.

1018
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:03,880
We'd keep on keeping on, trusting that you'll use us for your honor and for your glory.

1019
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,520
In these few moments of invitation, I pray that decisions would be made that would please

1020
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
thee.

1021
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,800
I pray that you'd work, Lord, as only you can.

1022
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,880
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1023
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,000
Would you stand with me?

1024
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1025
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,000
