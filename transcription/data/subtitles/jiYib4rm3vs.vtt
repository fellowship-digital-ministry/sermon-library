00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
but Psalm 119 as well.

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:03.960
If you would start in Psalm 119,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960
hold your place in Romans one.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.539
Thankful to have some folks visiting with us this morning.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.600
We do trust the service has already been a blessing

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800
and will continue to be a blessing to you.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.000
And Psalm 119, I wanna reference a couple of verses

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
by way of introduction,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.440
before we get into Romans chapter number one this morning,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.799
and be looking at a few verses

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.600
from Romans chapter number one.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.319
You've probably heard someone make a reference

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.399
at some point in your life to a snowball effect.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.639
You've heard somebody say that,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.799
you've heard somebody use that expression.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.520
The thought being communicated with that expression

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.159
is that one action or event

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.479
causes many other similar actions or events.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.759
The expression can be used in a positive sense

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.119
or in a negative sense.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.540
Personally, I've heard it used more negatively

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.639
than I have positively.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.080
I'm sure that that's the case for you as well.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.400
When I consider the history of the nation of Israel

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.040
and I think of Judah in particular

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.279
under the time of King Ahaz's reign,

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.639
I think about this particular expression

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:11.080
with the snowball effect.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.639
And I think about the wickedness

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.559
during his reign as King of Judah.

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.680
And I've written in the margin of my Bible

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.959
in 2 Chronicles chapter 28,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.000
the slippery slope of sin.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.040
If you were to study through that chapter

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.760
in 2 Chronicles 28,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.040
it will absolutely burden your heart

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.400
to see the progression of wickedness and evil

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.919
that takes place during the reign of King Ahaz,

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:39.360
no doubt a snowball effect,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.040
no doubt the slippery slope of sin.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.800
I believe this morning that even as we've sung

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.440
these patriotic songs

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.319
and we have these patriotic decorations

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.160
and I love America.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
I'm thankful to be an American citizen.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.120
More than being an American citizen,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.879
I'm thankful that I have citizenship in heaven.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.760
And first and foremost, I am a Christian.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.699
I am a child of God.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:07.120
Secondly, I'm an American.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.240
And I am so thankful as Paul speaks of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.899
to the people in Philippi

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.520
of having our citizenship in heaven

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.399
and knowing without any shadow of a doubt,

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.919
being 100% certain that heaven is your home,

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.320
not because of anything that you could do,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.880
not because of anything that I could do,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.279
but all because of what Jesus did

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.639
on a cruel cross nearly 2,000 years ago.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.940
And I'm thankful to be a Christian.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm so blessed, of course, for my heavenly citizenship,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.399
but I'm thankful to be an American.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.759
But I believe this morning

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.839
that as we evaluate the state of our nation,

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.740
we must be honest.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.339
We must acknowledge the trajectory of our nation.

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.539
As a nation, we have rejected God.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.639
As a nation, we have rejected God.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.919
And I believe that we are racing down

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.380
the slippery slope of sin.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.660
It's no longer the case in America

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.580
that wickedness is simply practiced or tolerated.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.199
No, today in America, wickedness is openly celebrated.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.259
And I don't wanna grieve your heart

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:23.380
as it grieves my heart.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.139
The reality of this reminds me

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.020
of what the psalmist said in Psalm 119,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.380
and that's why I've asked you to turn there

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.800
by way of introduction.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.119
In Psalm 119, the Bible speaks about

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.339
where the psalmist, and I believe it's representative

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.059
of the day in which we're living here in our nation as well,

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.259
where the people have made void the law of the Lord.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.179
And the psalmist says in Psalm 119 in verse 126,

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.339
notice what the Bible says in Psalm 119 and 126,

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:56.020
it is time for thee, Lord, to work.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.460
Why?

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.660
For they have made void thy law.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.580
We live in a time in which

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.240
it's no longer just the case

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.160
that they call evil good and good evil,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.380
but they legislate wickedness.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.859
They've made void the law of the Lord.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.320
Those of us that would claim to hold

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.920
to the truth of God's word are viewed as being bigots

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.359
or some other terminology that we're intolerant

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.480
and so on and so forth.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.760
But the reality is that the impact

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.239
that this truth made on the psalmist

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.380
ought to be the same impact in our lives.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.660
I want you to skip down to verse 136

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.739
and notice what the psalmist says.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:45.619
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.980
Why?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.940
Because they keep not thy law.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.420
God has graciously given us a Bible.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.059
I'm so thankful for the word of God.

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.160
I'm so thankful that God in his grace and mercy

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.779
and his sovereign,

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:07.779
just in his sovereignty that he just gave us a Bible

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.540
and he gave us his truth and he's revealed it to us.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.899
The Bible says to whom much is given, much is required.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.920
And if you know anything about the history

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.619
of this great nation, you understand

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.019
that there was an understanding

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:23.040
of the precepts of this book.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.859
You understand that there was an understanding

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:28.500
of the creator God.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:31.619
There's a fear of God.

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:36.260
This morning, I think about the impact on the psalmist

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.619
when he said they have made void thy law

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:42.540
and he says rivers of waters run down mine eyes

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540
because they keep not thy law.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.619
I wonder how many of us are truly broken

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.420
over what we see in our society today.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.820
So we see what's taking place in our nation today.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.820
Some unfortunately are looking to the next election cycle

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.619
and they think that that's where the hope

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.220
is going to come from and that's where we're gonna find

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.399
some level of refuge and we're gonna return to,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.339
listen, this morning, I wanna submit to you

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:10.540
and you've probably already seen it

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.679
on the back of the bulletin,

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.540
the title for the message this morning,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.320
the only hope for America is Jesus.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.980
And I'll say this, that this message this morning

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.739
is not just a message that could be preached in America,

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:24.339
it's a message that could be preached

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.779
in any of the countries of the world

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.579
because the only hope for any people

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.559
is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.820
That's the only hope for any people.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.179
And as we look at the society in which we're living

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:37.779
and we look at all of the wickedness

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.980
that is taking place and being celebrated

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.059
and we understand, listen, if you're aware

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.339
of what's taking place in our nation today,

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.459
you understand they are not,

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.420
they're no longer concealing their agenda.

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:53.140
I've stood in this pulpit for almost 12 years now

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.380
as the pastor of this church

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.519
and I've said on more than one occasion

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.500
of some of the wickedness that's taking place

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.420
in this nation and at times people feel like

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.579
or they make comment as if, oh, you're just,

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:08.339
you're exaggerating it, you're just, listen, it's real.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.100
They're coming for our children.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.260
They've made it known.

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:18.619
It's absolutely ungodly what's happening in our nation.

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:19.779
But what do we do?

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.760
Well, we respond like the psalmist did

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.660
but then we go to Romans chapter number one.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.459
In Romans chapter number one,

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:29.880
we're just gonna look at a few verses

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.540
of scripture this morning.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.420
Verses 14 through 16, a precious portion

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.320
of the Apostle Paul giving his testimony here.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:41.980
As we think about the Apostle Paul,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.299
of course, many of us would have

00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:46.140
a particular perspective of Paul.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.779
Some would say that he's the greatest Christian

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.059
that's ever lived and so on and so forth

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.160
but what I want you to understand about the Apostle Paul

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.059
is that Paul was a man that was fully surrendered to God.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.179
Paul was a man that was understanding

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.619
of his own personal salvation

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:05.660
and understanding of his own personal responsibility.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.779
He was a man that just lived for God.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.519
Some people say, what's the secret to Paul's success?

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:14.140
What's the secret to being used like Paul?

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.299
I want God to use me like Paul did.

00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:18.380
You gotta be surrendered.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.820
You gotta be yielded.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.059
You gotta come to a place where you say,

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:22.660
I'm crucified with Christ.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.859
That's what Paul says in Galatians two in verse number 20.

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.380
You gotta come to a place where you say,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.380
for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:36.500
My life is being lived for the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.419
We see Paul living that way.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.140
As I think about the only hope for America is Jesus

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.479
and I see in this passage of scripture

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:50.479
some thoughts that we must take heart to this morning.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.179
Notice the Bible says in Romans one in verse number 14,

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.900
I am debtor.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.900
Both to the Greeks and to the barbarians,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.299
both to the wise and to the unwise.

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:03.020
So as much as in me is,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.219
I am ready to preach the gospel to you

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:08.059
that are at Rome also.

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:11.200
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.460
For it is the power of God unto salvation

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.140
to everyone that believeth.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.700
To the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.940
We're taking notes this morning, number one.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:28.419
We need to embrace the personal responsibility

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:30.460
to share the gospel.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.659
I would say this morning that we must embrace

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:38.400
the personal responsibility to share the gospel.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.900
It's easy to look at what's going on in America

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.820
and to what's going on in our world

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.739
and to criticize and critique and to complain

00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:48.640
and to get upset and to get angry.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.380
It's easy to do those things.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.380
But we must understand biblically

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.460
that the only hope for any people,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.500
the only hope for this nation is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.020
And I would say to you this morning

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.059
that the only hope.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.219
of our nation hearing about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:05.139
as people that have been born again

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:06.999
that are the people of God.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:10.239
For God has said that it is our responsibility,

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:12.019
those that have been saved by the blood

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:13.499
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:18.499
it is our responsibility to be his witnesses.

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:22.899
And we must embrace the personal responsibility

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:24.139
to share the gospel.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:25.179
There's so many people,

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:27.379
there are theologians of yesteryear

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:29.459
that would look at the Great Commission

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:32.419
and they would try to excuse the responsibility

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:33.939
of the Great Commission by saying,

00:10:33.939 --> 00:10:36.619
well, that was just given to the disciples.

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:38.179
I would submit to you this morning

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.059
that Paul was not there

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.779
when the Lord Jesus Christ gave the Great Commission.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.379
In fact, at the time in which the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.739
gave the Great Commission,

00:10:46.739 --> 00:10:48.979
Saul was not a believer.

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:53.979
If you trace the history and you trace what's taking place,

00:10:53.979 --> 00:10:57.819
no doubt Saul was alive when Jesus was crucified,

00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:00.959
he was there and maybe not there when it took place,

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.379
but he was aware of the life

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:04.180
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.979
But Saul did not get saved

00:11:05.979 --> 00:11:08.860
until well after the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.099
He was not there when Jesus gave the Great Commission.

00:11:13.099 --> 00:11:16.659
Yet Paul says, after he's been saved,

00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:19.699
Acts chapter number nine, his life is transformed,

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:21.299
he knows that he's heaven bound,

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:25.860
he says, I am debtor.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.259
Personal responsibility.

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.579
So all of those that try to

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:34.500
remove themselves from the responsibility

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.099
of sharing the Great Commission,

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:37.819
sharing the gospel because they say,

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:40.239
well, that was just for the disciples.

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:42.099
You got a real problem with Romans chapter number one

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:43.819
in verse 14.

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:46.379
Because Paul says, I am debtor.

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:48.299
Do you see the personal aspect of it?

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:50.699
Paul is saying, I, personally.

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:52.459
He's not, at this point,

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:55.180
as he's addressing these believers in Rome,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.059
he's not simply saying to them,

00:11:57.099 --> 00:11:59.500
it's your responsibility to preach the gospel.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.939
He's saying, I am debtor.

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:05.099
I have this debt, I have this responsibility,

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.459
and he's owning it.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.699
We find that Jesus has left us

00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:14.699
as his people responsible to make him known.

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:17.020
Look over in Acts chapter 17, if you will.

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.500
In Acts chapter number 17,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.979
I often think of this portion of scripture

00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:25.339
after the apostle Paul has been on missionary journeys

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:28.220
and after the work that's gone on

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.080
and all the things that are taking place,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.059
and just, I mean, he's suffered so greatly

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:36.380
and all of these just adversities

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.419
that have come in his life.

00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:40.539
And there in Thessalonica, Berea,

00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:41.779
the work that's taking place

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:43.940
at the beginning of Acts chapter number 17,

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.300
we find that Paul is then kind of sent away

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.819
because the enemy is relentless

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:49.660
and the people are stirred up against him.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.779
And the Bible tells us in verse number 16

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:54.059
that Paul waited for them at Athens,

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:57.139
but the Bible says that his spirit was stirred in him.

00:12:57.139 --> 00:12:57.979
Why?

00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:01.580
Because he saw the city was wholly given to idolatry.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:05.739
And Paul, in this position in which

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:07.300
maybe we would say it this way,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.099
he was getting a little R&R

00:13:09.099 --> 00:13:12.220
and his ministry had been taxing

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.459
and all these adversities that have taken place,

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:15.860
and they've sent Paul to Athens

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.459
and you wait for us there,

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:19.959
but yet Paul, because he sees a city

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:22.099
that's wholly given to idolatry,

00:13:22.099 --> 00:13:24.699
his spirit is stirred within him.

00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:29.220
Now here's the real matter of Acts chapter number 17.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.059
It's possible this morning

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.440
for us to be stirred up and do nothing.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:37.580
It's possible that we could sit in a church service,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.899
that we could hear the preaching of God's word,

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:42.300
that we could go to some special meeting

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.459
at some church somewhere,

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:45.699
go to some conference and hear preaching

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:49.380
and get stirred up and do nothing.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.940
But Paul is stirred up and he does something about it.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.860
The stirring in Acts 17 in Paul's life

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.300
brings him to action.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.339
And if you skip down to verse number 23,

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:04.220
we won't spend time looking at all of the message,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.619
but I want you to know what he says in verse 23.

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:09.239
He says this to these people there in Athens.

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:10.080
He says,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.619
for as I passed by and beheld your devotions,

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:16.299
I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God,

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:18.779
whom therefore ye ignorantly worship.

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:19.859
Notice what he says,

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:24.019
him declare I unto you.

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:24.859
Paul says,

00:14:24.859 --> 00:14:26.619
I have a personal responsibility

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.419
and I'm gonna make him known.

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:30.260
Why is he,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.299
why Paul do you feel this need?

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.139
Because he says,

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.419
I am debtor in Romans one.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:39.260
This was the perspective that Paul had in his life.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.079
He understood that he had been given

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:42.660
this great responsibility.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.940
In first Corinthians one in verse 17,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.779
he says,

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:47.459
for Christ sent me not to baptize,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.059
but to preach the gospel,

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:51.440
not with wisdom of words,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.260
lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.700
Why Paul,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.600
as he enters into Corinth and listen,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.899
there are many adversaries,

00:14:58.899 --> 00:14:59.919
but God says,

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:02.779
I have much people in this city.

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:06.139
So what God tells Paul when he's going to enter into Corinth

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:07.839
and Paul goes there and he says,

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:08.679
listen,

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:10.559
God sent me to preach the gospel.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:11.399
Why?

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.980
Because Corinth needed the gospel.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.899
Because the only hope for Corinth was Jesus.

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:19.239
Corinth was a wicked place.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:20.459
If you study history

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:22.260
and we don't have time to deal with it this morning,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.859
but if you study the history of Corinth and that city,

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:28.019
the wickedness and all of those things

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:32.739
and God sends Paul in there to preach Christ.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.700
And he preached with boldness

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.380
and a church was established

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.179
and souls were saved

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.339
and lives were changed.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:46.100
But Paul said this in the same book

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.179
of first Corinthians chapter nine,

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:49.540
speaking about this,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.660
embracing the personal responsibility

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.899
to share the gospel

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:55.779
in first Corinthians nine in verse 16,

00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:56.619
Paul says this,

00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:57.839
for though I preach the gospel,

00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.419
I have nothing to glory of

00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:01.579
for necessity is laid upon me,

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:02.419
yea,

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:06.480
woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:08.619
I wonder this morning,

00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:12.500
as we look at the example of the apostle Paul

00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:14.100
and this first thought

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.579
of embracing the personal responsibility

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:17.839
to share the gospel,

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.480
I wonder this morning how many of us

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.019
really have that perspective

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:22.859
of first Corinthians nine and 16

00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:23.700
where we would say,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.500
woe is me if I preach not the gospel.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.980
I wonder this morning how much desire is in us

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.940
to be able to share the gospel with people.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.380
I wonder this morning how ready we are

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.899
to share the gospel with individuals.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:40.739
Why?

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:41.559
Because we know what it is.

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:43.839
We know the power of it.

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:46.679
And we understand that Paul has embraced

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.559
the personal responsibility

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:49.720
and therefore it leads us

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.480
to our second thought this morning

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.320
that we must engage in the work

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.660
of personal evangelism.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.500
See,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.040
I will not engage in the work

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.399
of personal evangelism

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:03.959
until I first embrace the personal responsibility.

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:07.000
If I do not think it's a responsibility that's mine,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.160
then I'm not going to engage in the work.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.679
But Paul begins this great passage of scripture

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.179
in Romans 1, 14 through 16

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:14.320
by saying first of all,

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.119
I am debtor.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.100
And because of that recognition

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.119
of his personal responsibility,

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.899
it leads him to engage in the work

00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:26.359
of personal evangelism

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.239
where the Bible says this in verse 15

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:29.639
back in Romans one,

00:17:29.639 --> 00:17:33.839
so as much as in me is,

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:37.820
I am ready to preach the gospel

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.660
to you that are at Rome also.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.859
And I love how Paul says I'm ready.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:46.700
I believe that Paul was prepared.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.380
It carries with it that idea,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.059
we speak of Ezra in the Old Testament

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:51.579
of being a ready scribe,

00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:54.059
an individual that had prepared himself

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:56.619
for the ministry that God would give him.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.700
And because he was a ready scribe,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.059
because he was prepared,

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:03.739
God opened doors of opportunity for Ezra.

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:05.540
And here Paul says I'm ready,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.619
I'm prepared.

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:08.579
I'm ready for this.

00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:11.059
And we find that he says I'm ready to do what?

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.339
He's ready to preach the gospel.

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:14.820
And we must understand this morning

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.940
that when we engage in the work

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.419
of personal evangelism,

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:20.519
that the gospel is absolutely essential.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.500
And we cannot lose sight of what the gospel is.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.639
According to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.059
the gospel very simply defined

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:35.059
is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.380
But understand that as we preach the gospel,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.380
that there has to be some understanding

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.659
as to why Jesus had to die.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.619
When we just simply begin with the fact

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:46.500
that Christ died on a cruel cross

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.020
nearly 2,000 years ago,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.640
we must answer the question why did he die?

00:18:51.979 --> 00:18:53.679
He died because we're sinners.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.580
And he died because sin requires a payment.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.760
There's a penalty.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.419
And yes, we must deal with

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.260
and we must acknowledge the fact

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.820
that God so loved the world

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.260
and I'm thankful for God's love.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.640
But even as we dealt with in Sunday school this morning,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.880
we must acknowledge the fact that God is just.

00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:21.179
And the reality is that God,

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:23.659
because of man's sin,

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:26.460
Jesus, God in flesh,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.900
had to go to that cruel cross

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.500
because a payment had to be made.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.739
So when we share the gospel,

00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:34.840
the gospel, listen, it doesn't start out real positive.

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:37.140
Why do I say that?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.380
Because it starts out by saying you're a sinner.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.539
And because of your sin, there's a penalty.

00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:45.500
You know what the message is of the Bible?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.619
Repent!

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.039
Why?

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.419
Because your sin

00:19:52.979 --> 00:19:56.159
is gonna send you to the lake of fire.

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.739
For the Bible says the wages of sin

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:01.639
is death.

00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:03.239
And so a pastor, that's not very popular.

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:04.299
I understand that.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:08.399
Truth is becoming less and less popular in our day.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:14.359
But nonetheless, the truth of God's word must be proclaimed.

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:17.239
It is not sufficient that we can simply say

00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:20.799
that people, well, you know, just do the best you can

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.919
and be the best you can

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.759
and just everything's gonna work out okay.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.479
You know why I can't say that?

00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:28.239
Because the Bible doesn't say that.

00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:31.159
I preached a funeral on Tuesday.

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:33.399
I don't know the family.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:35.679
It was a unique situation.

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:38.279
I was called upon simply because I pastor a church

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.519
to preach a funeral.

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:44.299
I don't know anything about the family whatsoever.

00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:48.559
Very brief interactions before the funeral.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:50.439
To the best of my knowledge,

00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:54.159
the deceased had not trusted Christ as their savior.

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:55.839
That's a difficult situation.

00:20:59.239 --> 00:21:02.079
And I believe that mostly what the family wanted to hear

00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:03.559
was for somebody to stand up and say,

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.159
your loved one is in heaven.

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.359
I couldn't say that.

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:12.519
I could simply talk about the hope I have of heaven.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:18.119
The reality that one day I will see my savior face to face.

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:19.399
I did not stand there

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:21.399
and say anything negative about the deceased.

00:21:21.399 --> 00:21:23.519
I didn't think that would be appropriate.

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.399
I don't know them.

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:26.579
I simply shared my testimony.

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.839
And the reality this morning

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:31.439
is that when we think about this engaging

00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:33.879
in the work of personal evangelism,

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:37.079
it requires that we share the gospel.

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:38.639
It requires, listen,

00:21:38.639 --> 00:21:41.799
personal evangelism is confrontational.

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:43.599
It's personal.

00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:46.199
I'm all for giving gospel tracts.

00:21:46.199 --> 00:21:47.559
I use them all the time.

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:49.439
But understand that giving a gospel tract

00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:52.159
is not the same as engaging in personal evangelism.

00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:54.899
We hang door hangers and I'm for it,

00:21:54.899 --> 00:21:56.479
but it's not the same as knocking a door

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:58.659
and confronting somebody about their need

00:21:58.659 --> 00:22:00.399
for the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:05.279
This morning, I'm thankful that there are videos

00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:07.419
that you can send people to and so on and so forth,

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:09.119
but I would submit to you this morning

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:12.379
that none of those things are as powerful as this book.

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:15.999
What happened when the rich man died?

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.479
He's in hell.

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:22.059
And he says, would you send Lazarus

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:24.799
to relieve me of some of this misery

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:26.559
and it cannot be done.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:28.679
And so what's the request of the rich man?

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:31.679
Send Lazarus back to my brothers.

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:34.159
Why?

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.359
Because my brothers are gonna die

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:37.539
and come to this place as well.

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:39.559
And I don't want them to.

00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:41.559
Is that not Luke 16?

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:47.179
And guess what the response to that rich man is.

00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:51.899
They have Moses and the prophets.

00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:55.979
If they don't believe them,

00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:59.999
they're not gonna believe the one rose from the dead.

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:02.659
One came, Lazarus, to them.

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:04.899
What's he telling us?

00:23:04.899 --> 00:23:07.779
He's telling us the sufficiency of this book.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:10.259
So many people, oh, if I could just see a vision.

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:11.619
Oh, if I could just have a dream.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:12.779
Oh, if I could just this.

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:14.979
Oh, if I could just that.

00:23:14.979 --> 00:23:16.019
God's word.

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:18.059
God's word.

00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:20.719
You say, well, there's this video

00:23:20.719 --> 00:23:22.879
or there's this series or there's this whatever.

00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:27.199
Personal evangelism requires preaching the word of God.

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:29.179
Plain and simple.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:32.079
Sometimes I think we complicate it.

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:35.679
It's actually not very complicated.

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:40.199
The gospel's simple.

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.899
The gospel is powerful.

00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:46.719
I'll read a couple of verses to you.

00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:48.519
You don't need to turn there for sake of time.

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:50.079
But here in the same book of Romans

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:53.279
in the 15th chapter, Paul says this.

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:56.519
We talk about engaging the work of personal evangelism.

00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:00.979
In Romans 15 in verse number 19,

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:07.959
he said there in verse number 15, I am ready.

00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:10.579
He says in verse 16, I am not ashamed.

00:24:11.879 --> 00:24:14.479
Notice what he says in Romans 15 in verse 19.

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:16.139
Through mighty signs and wonders

00:24:16.139 --> 00:24:17.319
by the power of the spirit of God

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:19.079
so that from Jerusalem and round about

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:24.079
unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:25.799
That's a great testimony.

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:29.279
Paul didn't simply make the statement

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.919
of I'm dead and I'm ready and I'm not ashamed.

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:35.039
He actually went and engaged in personal evangelism.

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:37.440
He embraced that personal responsibility.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.359
And again, until we embrace that personal responsibility,

00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:42.639
we will not engage in the work.

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:45.479
But the hope for America is Jesus.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.079
Who's gonna tell him about Jesus?

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:52.720
It's gotta be somebody that knows Jesus.

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:55.059
The Jesus of the Bible.

00:24:55.959 --> 00:24:57.160
The Jesus of the Bible.

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:01.199
Listen, Hollywood's not gonna tell him about Jesus.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:03.679
It's not.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I'm not waiting for Congress to tell people about Jesus.

00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:15.160
They're the ones that remove prayer.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.799
They're the ones that remove, 10 Commandments, right?

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:20.359
I know it wasn't in this era,

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:23.359
but for some of you, it was in your era.

00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:26.279
I'm not waiting on Congress, it's the church.

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:28.519
It's God's people.

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.979
Paul said this in Acts 20 and verse 31.

00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:35.359
I referenced this passage of scripture last week

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:39.839
and Sunday evening, but I wanna read again

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:42.239
this verse of scripture with regard to the content

00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:45.099
of this message this morning in Acts 20 and verse 31.

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:46.959
The Bible says that Paul makes this statement

00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:50.359
to these church leaders of the church at Ephesus

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:53.359
in verse 31, therefore watch and remember

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:55.160
that by the space of three years,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.160
I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.279
Paul, why were you so concerned about this?

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:07.720
Why were you engaging people night and day with tears?

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.599
Why is it that you would say that you cease not

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:11.359
to warn everyone night and day?

00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:14.160
Well, because Paul understood that everyone's gonna die.

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:16.239
Everyone's gonna die.

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:18.919
I don't know when I'm gonna die.

00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:21.559
You don't know when you're gonna die,

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.160
but everyone of us is gonna die.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.319
Where are we gonna go?

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:29.919
This morning, I'm thankful that I know for sure,

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.519
100% certainty that I'm going to heaven when I die.

00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:35.619
Not because I'm a good person,

00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:37.000
not because I pastor a church,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.679
not because I put money in the offering plate,

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:42.039
not because I, because Jesus Christ died for me.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.759
And he paid a debt that I could not pay.

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:52.639
And I recognized on a day in August of 1997

00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:58.959
that I was a sinner on my way to a Christless eternity

00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:00.839
in the Lake of Fire,

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:03.479
separated from God for all of eternity,

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:06.359
justly because of my sin.

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:08.039
I was guilty.

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:10.000
Listen, people today, well, I'm really not that bad.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.319
Listen, you're guilty.

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:13.880
You're guilty.

00:27:17.959 --> 00:27:20.500
But he loved me and he died for me.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:25.380
And I simply accepted him as my savior.

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:28.239
And this transaction took place

00:27:28.239 --> 00:27:30.880
that I can't even still today fully understand,

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:36.919
where he took my sin and gave me his righteousness.

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:40.479
It's unbelievable, but it's true.

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:43.399
I just said it's unbelievable,

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:45.160
and as I said it, I said I shouldn't have said it that way.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.000
Why?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.959
It would be unbelievable except for the fact

00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:49.959
that God told us in his word.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.519
And it's absolutely believable

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:55.359
because let God be true and every man a liar.

00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:58.440
In fact, Paul says it this way

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.880
with regard to this very subject in Titus chapter number one

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.119
when he's speaking about this truth of God and salvation.

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:07.639
He says, in hope of eternal life,

00:28:07.639 --> 00:28:12.639
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.139
I'm so thankful.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:18.919
This morning, we need to embrace

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:22.440
the personal responsibility to share the gospel.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.599
Number two, we must engage

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:25.959
in the work of personal evangelism.

00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:28.199
And I would say this, number three,

00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:30.880
we must expect God to work.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.039
Must expect God to work.

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:37.399
See, in verse 16 of Romans chapter number one,

00:28:37.399 --> 00:28:40.679
Paul says I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:41.520
Why?

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.000
He says for it is the power of God unto salvation

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.359
to everyone that believe it,

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:51.380
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:55.760
Listen, though we're nearly 2,000 years

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.599
past the death of Christ and the resurrection

00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:01.959
and the ascension of Christ

00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:05.260
and the New Testament church going forward,

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.599
listen, the plan of God,

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:11.320
the gospel message cannot be improved on.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.760
He said we're in 2023.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.679
It cannot be improved on.

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:22.039
The gospel then and the gospel today

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:25.419
is the power of God unto salvation.

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:28.799
And Paul believed that.

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:32.719
And so Paul, as he embraced this personal responsibility

00:29:32.719 --> 00:29:35.119
and then engaged in personal evangelism,

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:39.000
I believe that Paul expected God to work.

00:29:39.839 --> 00:29:44.839
Missionary of yesteryear said expect great things from God

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:49.700
but attempt great things for God.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.479
As we attempt great things for God,

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:54.359
we're expecting that God's going to work.

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:57.599
God said that he's not willing that any should perish

00:29:57.599 --> 00:29:59.679
but that all should come to repentance.

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.439
You're praying for that loved one.

00:30:01.439 --> 00:30:04.079
You're engaging that neighbor,

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:06.079
that coworker with the gospel.

00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:07.659
You're talking to that individual

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:10.639
and you're expecting God to work.

00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:11.659
I've had people say, Pastor,

00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:14.639
I just want him to be saved so much, not more than God.

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:19.159
And I understand how much we want our loved ones to be saved

00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:22.379
but God said he's not willing that any should perish

00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:23.999
but that all should come to repentance

00:30:23.999 --> 00:30:25.519
and we expect God to work.

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:29.919
Now listen, God will not overpower our own free will.

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:33.839
God has chosen that he created man with a free will

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:35.059
and they have choice.

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:39.599
They have the responsibility to respond to that invitation

00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:43.079
that was extended to that free gift offer of eternal life

00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:45.359
and someone can say, no, I'm okay,

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:46.999
I'm gonna just do it my way

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:50.279
and they can reject that gift or they can receive that gift

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:53.699
and that is outside of our ability to do anything about.

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:56.639
But at some point,

00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:01.039
your neighbors and your coworkers and my neighbors

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:02.279
and I can't say my coworkers

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:05.239
because Holly is my only coworker and she's saved, amen,

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:07.459
but those that I come into contact with,

00:31:07.459 --> 00:31:09.919
they need to hear the truth of the gospel

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:12.559
and they need to be given an opportunity

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.479
to respond to the gospel.

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:17.899
What are you gonna do with Jesus?

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:21.399
Are you gonna trust him or are you gonna reject him?

00:31:25.879 --> 00:31:29.799
Paul expected that God would work.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:34.799
1 Timothy 1 and verse 15, Paul made this statement.

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:36.919
I mentioned by way of introduction that some would say

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:39.119
that Paul was the greatest of all Christians

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:42.579
and he says of himself that he is the chief of all sinners.

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:49.599
By the way, another clue as to why God used Paul

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:50.999
the way that he did.

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:52.799
He was a humble servant of the Lord.

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:58.159
But in 1 Timothy 1 and verse 14,

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.479
the Bible says in the grace of our Lord

00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:01.879
was exceeding abundant with faith and love

00:32:01.879 --> 00:32:03.999
which is in Christ Jesus.

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:05.959
So thankful for God's grace.

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:09.839
Then Paul says this in verse 15 of 1 Timothy 1,

00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:13.239
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:16.559
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:17.839
of whom I am chief.

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:20.839
The Bible says, Jesus says this,

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:22.879
I came to seek and to save.

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:28.839
We see Jesus interacting as you study the gospel records

00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:32.199
and you see how that he purposefully interacted

00:32:32.199 --> 00:32:34.479
and traveled and went to certain places

00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:38.239
as he was seeking sinners in need of salvation.

00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:42.719
We find that there, as you read the fourth chapter

00:32:42.719 --> 00:32:44.559
of the book of John, he says,

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:46.759
I must needs go through Samaria.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:50.839
And he meets the woman at the well.

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:53.159
What a great passage of scripture.

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.199
That lady was saved.

00:32:56.199 --> 00:32:58.519
And many of the Samaritans were saved as well.

00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:04.279
We find here this morning that Paul testifies

00:33:04.279 --> 00:33:06.639
as he's encouraging his son in the faith, Timothy,

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:08.679
that listen, understand that Christ Jesus

00:33:08.679 --> 00:33:09.799
came into the world to save sinners.

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:10.639
Guess what?

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:12.639
He's still saving sinners.

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:14.399
We need to expect God to work.

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:16.079
In verse number four of chapter two,

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:19.099
just a few verses past verse 15 there.

00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:20.719
I know that it's another chapter,

00:33:20.719 --> 00:33:22.159
but notice it says in verse four,

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.279
who will have all men to be saved

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:26.559
and come under the knowledge of the truth.

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:31.679
He's able to save to the uttermost,

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.759
the Bible tells us in Hebrews seven and verse 25.

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:36.679
I'm reminded of the principle,

00:33:36.679 --> 00:33:38.039
the promise that I've already mentioned

00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:40.039
from second Peter three and verse number nine,

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:41.239
where the Bible says that he's not willing

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:43.439
that any should perish,

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:46.519
but that all should come to repentance.

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:48.919
And we expect God to work.

00:33:48.919 --> 00:33:51.239
Turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will.

00:33:51.239 --> 00:33:53.279
Let me use this Old Testament passage

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.159
and consider with me this morning

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:57.159
as we make New Testament application

00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:58.519
in Isaiah chapter number one,

00:33:58.519 --> 00:34:00.319
and then we'll look at another passage here

00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:02.319
in just a moment in the book of Isaiah.

00:34:04.199 --> 00:34:05.819
Remember what the psalmist said

00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:08.519
as we started by way of introduction

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:10.839
this morning to our message in Psalm 119

00:34:11.479 --> 00:34:12.959
and verse number 126.

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:15.159
It is time for thee, Lord, to what?

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.199
To work, for they've made void thy law.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.559
And I'm expecting God to work as we preach the gospel.

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:25.759
Listen, it's not your gospel, it's not my gospel,

00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:27.000
it's his gospel.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.179
If you're trying to get a group of people to follow you,

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.119
if I'm trying to get a group of people to follow me,

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.639
it's just gonna fall.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.119
I'm pointing people to Jesus.

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.820
The only hope for our nation is Jesus.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:46.220
Notice in Isaiah one, the Bible says this in verse 18.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.220
Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord.

00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:55.339
Though your sins be as scarlet, notice what he says,

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:57.500
they shall be as white as snow.

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:03.419
Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

00:35:03.419 --> 00:35:06.179
Isn't that a blessed truth, a blessed promise?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.660
Yeah.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.600
Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.

00:35:11.619 --> 00:35:14.299
But notice the response, it says this in verse 19.

00:35:14.299 --> 00:35:17.539
If ye be willing and obedient,

00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:19.059
you shall eat the good of the land.

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:20.339
But if you refuse and rebel,

00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:21.859
you shall be devoured with the sword,

00:35:21.859 --> 00:35:23.699
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:26.139
Now understand this morning as we make application

00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:27.619
from this text of scripture,

00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:29.899
as we understand Israel and what's happening

00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:32.380
and so on and so forth with Isaiah's and his prophecy

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.419
and the land and so on and so forth.

00:35:34.419 --> 00:35:35.979
But we understand this morning

00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:37.859
that when we speak about the gospel

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:40.339
that Jesus is saying to people, come,

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:45.419
come, the invitation of the book of Revelation, come.

00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:50.859
Though your sins be as scarlet,

00:35:51.779 --> 00:35:53.320
they shall be white as snow.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.979
Again, it's that transaction that takes place.

00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:56.979
How many of you ever heard that song?

00:35:56.979 --> 00:35:58.539
I don't think it's in our song book, maybe it is.

00:35:58.539 --> 00:36:01.179
The old account was settled long ago.

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:03.220
And I love that song.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.579
Long ago where, down at the cross.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.739
I said it all long ago.

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:10.559
There's a great transaction that took place.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.940
There has to be a recognition of guilt.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.779
I'm a sinner.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.139
And we expect God to work because it's the power of God

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:28.220
unto salvation, what is the gospel?

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.899
Notice what he says in Isaiah 59.

00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:34.899
Isaiah 59, again, we understand the historical context.

00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:43.839
But I want you to understand the application as well.

00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:50.179
From Isaiah 59, in verse number one.

00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:56.299
Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened

00:36:56.299 --> 00:36:58.359
that it cannot save.

00:36:58.359 --> 00:37:01.639
Neither is your heavy that it cannot hear.

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:04.440
Aren't you thankful that he's able to save?

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.279
He's able to save.

00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:07.859
Notice verse two.

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:10.160
But your iniquities have separated between you and your God

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.940
and your sins have hid his face from you

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.720
that he will not hear.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.279
Listen, understand this morning

00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:18.119
that sinners are separated from God.

00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:20.839
At enmity with God.

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.739
But God loved us.

00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:27.079
He died for us.

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.519
But God commended his love toward us

00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:32.000
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:35.440
And we expect that as we preach that message

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.160
that God will work.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.600
What is God gonna do?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.239
He's gonna save people.

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:42.639
What does it mean to be saved, to be born again?

00:37:43.759 --> 00:37:46.279
To be heaven bound, to understand

00:37:46.279 --> 00:37:48.199
that our citizenship is in heaven.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.479
To know, as Paul said, to be absent from the body

00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:56.199
is to be present with the Lord.

00:37:56.199 --> 00:37:59.399
I mean, with 100% confidence and certainty,

00:37:59.399 --> 00:38:01.220
knowing that heaven is your home.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.059
Why?

00:38:02.059 --> 00:38:03.419
Because you're born again.

00:38:06.279 --> 00:38:08.880
But what does he do in our lives?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.600
Well, the Bible says that if any man be in Christ,

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.239
Joseph said that that man in Scotland

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.839
reminds the missionary every time he comes to church,

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:22.919
I'm a new creature.

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:25.279
Right, is that what he said?

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.679
Why does he say that?

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.679
Because the Bible says,

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:30.399
in 2 Corinthians 5, verse number 17,

00:38:30.399 --> 00:38:34.520
if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.739
Old things are passed away,

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:37.640
behold, all things are become new.

00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:40.440
Listen, God begins to do a work in us.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.039
The Holy Spirit indwells us

00:38:42.039 --> 00:38:44.399
and God begins to do a work in us.

00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:46.119
It's amazing what God does in us.

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:46.960
Listen, there are people that say,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.559
well, I gotta get cleaned up in order to come to Christ.

00:38:49.559 --> 00:38:52.359
No, you can't get cleaned up to come to Christ.

00:38:52.359 --> 00:38:54.559
You come to Christ because you're dirty.

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:56.440
You come to Christ because you're a sinner

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.200
and you need the Savior, amen.

00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:02.719
Someone used this analogy, I heard it not long ago,

00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:04.919
that you don't get cleaned up before you get a shower.

00:39:04.919 --> 00:39:06.820
You get a shower because you're dirty.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.919
This morning, we're expecting God to work

00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:15.559
and to transform people.

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:17.919
It's amazing the work that God does

00:39:17.919 --> 00:39:22.479
in the heart of his children as they're made alive.

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:27.399
They're quickened, they're born again, they're saved.

00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:28.719
God does a work.

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:32.200
Listen, I don't know, it's 25 years ago,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.419
almost 26 years ago, now I trust that Christ is my Savior.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.039
Just another six weeks or so, it'll be 26 years.

00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:41.580
God changed my life.

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:44.159
He did a work in my life.

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.559
He's still doing a work in my life.

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:47.000
We sing the song with the Sunday school kids,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.919
God's still working on me.

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:52.200
He made all the creation, the sun, the moon,

00:39:52.919 --> 00:39:54.960
the stars in six days, but he's still working on me

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.779
and how gracious and merciful he is indeed

00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:59.520
that he's still working on us.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.040
But man, He changes us.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.160
We sing the song, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160
Why?

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.320
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.400
It's a constant battle.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.720
It's a daily struggle that we're going to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.120
the lust of the flesh, but we see that God transforms us.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.800
Listen, when God saves an individual, He doesn't leave them like they were.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.120
He will take you just as you are, and I'm thankful for that.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.200
He will accept you just as you are, but He doesn't leave you just like you were.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.120
He changes you.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.520
He changes you.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.640
I don't think the same way anymore.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.640
I don't do the same things anymore.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.640
Why?

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.400
Because I'm a child of God.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.920
The Holy Spirit of God lives within me.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.800
How many of you that, you don't need to raise your hand, but since you got saved, the Holy

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.040
Spirit convicts you.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.720
It's a good thing when He convicts you.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.520
I won't tell you the exact details, but I was convicted this week.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.080
How many of you ever get in a situation, you say something, and you say, I shouldn't have

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.480
said that.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:14.960
I'm human just like you are, and that happened this week in my life, and I said something

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.360
that just wasn't very kind.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.280
God's convicted me on that.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.280
Why?

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520
Why?

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.520
Because I'm a new creature now.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.040
God says, that wasn't right behavior.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.960
You say, really, just because of a word that you said?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.960
Yeah.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960
Yeah.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.080
God changes us.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.680
This morning, we look at our beloved nation, and we see all the things that are taking

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680
place.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680
Listen, I watch the news.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.280
I see things just like you do.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.880
We see the state of the church.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:42:02.960
By and large, the state of the church is embarrassing, honestly, embarrassing.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:11.600
They have forsooken this book, most of them, mainstream Christianity in America.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.200
They've just walked away from God's Word.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.280
Well, you know, it's 2023, and things are different now, and we should be able to do

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.920
this, and we should be able to do that, and this is okay.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:35.480
The eternal holy God gave us a book that transcends time.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:42.240
If He said it was wrong 2,000 years ago, it's still wrong today.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.200
It's pretty simple.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.040
I'm not the authority, and neither are you.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.240
God is in His Word.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.520
What do we do in our nation?

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.520
What's the hope for our nation?

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.840
Well, did you see who's running for?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.920
No, no, no.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.920
It's not an election.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.400
That's not the hope for our nation.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.720
The only hope for America is Jesus.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.920
That's the only hope for our nation, and the only hope for your neighbors, your co-workers,

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:22.120
my neighbors, those people that I interact with, to hear about Jesus is if I open my

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.520
mouth and if you open your mouth and you tell them.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.920
God's given us that personal responsibility, and I hope this morning, as we think about

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.600
our nation, and we can complain, we can sit around for days and complain about what's

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.600
going on in our nation.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.520
We really could, but I wonder this morning how many of us are going to embrace the personal

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:48.120
responsibility and say, as Paul said, I am debtor?

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:54.160
How many of us are going to engage in personal evangelism and say, I am ready to preach the

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.320
gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection?

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.880
Why did Christ have to die?

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.600
Because you're a sinner, and I'm a sinner.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:08.040
He paid the price that He did not owe, that I could not pay, because He loved me, and

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.200
He loves you.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.880
And then we expect God to work.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.680
Listen, Holly planted some seeds this year for a garden.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.840
Some of you start a garden with plants, some start with seeds.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.000
Last year, we just went to the nursery and bought some plants and planted them in the

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
garden.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.200
And this year, Holly said, I'm going to start with seeds.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.000
And I said, honey, it's really easy to just go to the nursery and buy the plants.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.920
She said, no, we got this big window, and I'm going to put these, and she started them

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:45.600
in an egg crate, just a little bit of soil, seeds.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.800
She watered them.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.240
Then she put them into little cups.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.240
Why did she do that?

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.440
Well, she expected something to happen.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.160
She didn't do it because she was bored and she had nothing else to do.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.960
She had an expectation.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120
And guess what we were talking yesterday?

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:15.400
She said, do you see all the flowers on the plants outside?

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:22.040
One day soon, I'm going to eat a tomato sandwich with a tomato from my garden.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.160
Why?

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.640
Because there was an expectation that something was going to happen when that seed was put

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.880
in that soil, in the sunlight, with water.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.960
That growth would take place.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:44.480
That fruit would be produced.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.880
We need to expect God to work.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.360
God's not done.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.480
If God was done saving people, He'd have done the trumpet of the Lord would sound and we'd

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.520
be home.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.600
Hallelujah.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.560
So He hasn't done that yet.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.120
So that means we have a job to do.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.120
We need to expect God to work.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.120
Let's pray.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.920
Father, we love you.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.440
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.400
Thank you for the testimony of the Apostle Paul.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.160
Thank you for his work, his ministry.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:27.200
I thank you for the opportunity that we have this morning that we could look at a passage

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:33.400
of Scripture such as this and make application even to our own nation, to any nation on the

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400
globe today.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.280
The only hope for people is Jesus.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.760
God, if there's one that's present here at this property that's not sure of heaven, they

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.520
heard much today about salvation, about being born again, about going to heaven, but if

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.920
they'd be honest in their lives and they say, you know, I really hope that I go to heaven

00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.000
one day, but I'm just not sure, God, I pray that they'd come to this old-fashioned altar.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.800
We'd have an opportunity to open a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.160
heaven's their home.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.360
Maybe somebody that's tuned in via live stream this morning, not sure of heaven, God, I pray

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.440
they wouldn't just click off and be done, God, I pray they'd be saved.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:23.880
Lord, I know the personal testimony of many that are gathered here this morning that we've

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.440
been born again, we've been saved.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:32.320
I pray that this message would not only stir us, but I pray, God, that it would change

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:41.080
us, that we'd be stirred to action as Paul was in Acts 17.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:49.160
I pray, God, that you would use us to engage in the work of personal evangelism, that we'd

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:56.760
expect you to work, that we'd not get discouraged by the adversity that we'll face.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:03.880
We'd keep on keeping on, trusting that you'll use us for your honor and for your glory.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.520
In these few moments of invitation, I pray that decisions would be made that would please

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.520
thee.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.800
I pray that you'd work, Lord, as only you can.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.880
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.000
Would you stand with me?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:17.000
