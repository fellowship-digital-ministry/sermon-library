WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.239
24, and it is said that A. W. Tozer was asked,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:06.639
what will revival cost?

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.119
We've, of course, been dealing with this subject matter

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.380
of preparation for revival,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.279
as our fall revival meeting will begin

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.600
next Sunday through Wednesday.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.559
And A. W. Tozer, many of you are familiar

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.079
with maybe some of his writings and his ministry.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.879
He was asked that question, how much will revival cost?

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.520
And here's his answer,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.639
absolutely everything and absolutely nothing.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.360
That is how much it will cost.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.000
It will cost not one dime,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.360
and it will cost everything we have.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.240
Revival can't be bought monetarily,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.159
but the reality is that when we begin to think about

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.360
the cost of revival, the price of revival,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.759
some people aren't interested in revival

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.680
because they're not willing to give up anything

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.479
in order to have revival.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.000
And they look at it from a perspective

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.959
of I don't wanna give up this, I don't wanna change this,

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:57.840
I like how things are going,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.000
but the reality is that the comfortable Christian

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.440
is really what we see there in the church

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
of the Laodiceans in Revelation 3.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.559
And we have had a measure of comfort

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:11.480
and it's time that God would get us,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.800
awaken us, and get us out of our comfort zone,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
so to speak, and we'd be willing to pay the price,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.720
recognizing the fact that our Lord and Savior

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.239
paid everything for our redemption.

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:24.680
We are bought with a price.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.760
I was meditating on that thought this morning

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.279
in my office, and as I was meditating upon that thought,

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.879
I had really this thought come to mind.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.959
I don't think it's necessarily that we forget

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.199
that we are bought with a price,

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.080
I think sometimes we're just not mindful

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.599
of the fact that we're bought with a price.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.919
And we are owned by God, He owns us, He bought us,

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.839
amen, with His precious blood,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.800
and what a blessing that is.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.480
This morning as we have message number three

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.800
on preparation for revival,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.139
and I look at this particular text of scripture,

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.239
really just a verse of scripture

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.599
that we're gonna take from Acts 24,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.760
and then we'll look at a number of passages

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.459
of scripture here this morning,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.819
but I want you to understand that as we have this thought

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.599
of preparation for revival,

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.380
many times we've been asked this question, are you ready?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.380
And if someone were to ask you, are you ready,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.000
you say, well, that question requires some context.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.479
Am I ready for what?

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.119
And within the context of these messages

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.440
over the past few weeks, we're dealing with the fact,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.279
are we ready for revival?

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.080
Are we in that place where we're ready, we're prepared?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.199
The idea of being ready is to be in a state of preparation

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.279
so as to need no delay.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.000
And we think about this truth of being ready,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.580
and there are times if we think about it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.520
from a human perspective that maybe someone said,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.660
are you ready for something?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.520
And whatever that something was,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.440
you just weren't quite prepared for it,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.880
and it took you by surprise, you had forgotten about it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.759
or whatever it might be,

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.119
or maybe you were adequately prepared, you were ready,

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.720
but a professor in Bible college, his name was Dr. Bish,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.119
and Dr. Bish was a favorite of professors

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.820
in our Bible college until he started walking into the class

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.759
and he would walk in the class after a little while

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.360
and he'd walk in, man, he was just a happy man

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.100
and just full of the joy of the Lord,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.880
and he'd walk in and he'd be walking in like this.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.559
And he'd be walking in, you thought, man,

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.320
Brother Bish is just happy today.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.919
He's just got the joy of the Lord.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.440
And then you found out that that was indicating

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.600
there was a pop test, and there's a pop quiz coming up,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.000
and Dr. Bish was the kind of man that had the perspective

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.600
that his preparation for finals,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.639
many of our professors would be very kind

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.339
and give us some very detailed information

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.919
as to what would be on the final exam,

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.240
and Dr. Bish would always come to class before finals

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.100
and he would say, know everything.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.759
That's your preparation, and he'd leave.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.880
Know everything.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.440
And that was just Dr. Bish, that's just how he was.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.600
And the reality is that there were days

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.559
when he walked in doing this,

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.800
that I felt like I need to miss class today.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.360
I wasn't prepared, I wasn't ready

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.800
for a pop quiz or a pop test.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.360
We think about this idea of being revival ready,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.039
preparation for revival.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.740
I personally desire to be revival ready.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.360
I desire for our church to be revival ready,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.559
but I recognize that there's nothing I can do

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.320
to make anyone revival ready.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.639
I can preach messages, I can give truth,

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.799
I can try to give some encouragement,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.880
but the reality is that the decision lies

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.839
within each and every one of us

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.000
whether or not we'll be revival ready.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.320
I'm expecting God to work, I'm asking God to work,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.839
I'm desiring to see God work,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.640
and I wanna come to each service,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.760
even as I come to each service,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.559
the privilege of preaching, many people think,

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.200
oh, it's a different perspective.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.420
Yes, I get to be dealt with all week long

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.559
as I prepare the message,

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.079
and then I get to be dealt with again on Sunday

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.720
when I deliver the message.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.880
The reality is that God is at work, and God moves,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.359
and we expect God to work.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.320
We anticipate God's working,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.940
and even as I prayed this morning,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.160
I don't wanna simply be ready to receive,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.040
but I wanna be ready to respond.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.940
I wanna be a doer of the word.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.880
I wanna follow the leadership of God in my life,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.440
and I believe that in order for us to be revival ready,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.600
I've titled the message this morning,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.559
I have to ensure that there is nothing

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.279
between my soul and my Savior.

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.000
And there's a great song, of course,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that we're familiar with, that great hymn,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.399
nothing between my soul and my Savior,

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.320
and I've used that as our title this morning,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.040
and I want you to notice that Paul here

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.880
in Acts chapter number 24,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.600
contextually, he's giving his defense before Felix.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200
Of course, he's been arrested in prison.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.179
He's giving his defense, and I'm gonna pick it up

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:37.720
right in the middle of the passage of Scripture

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.399
because I wanna focus in on a statement that Paul makes,

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.019
and I hope that as we focus on this statement this morning,

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:46.000
that it will help us with having the same perspective

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.359
and the same goal to be revival ready

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.859
by having nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:53.600
Notice in verse number 16, here's what Paul says,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.739
and herein do I exercise myself.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.679
Think about that word exercise.

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:02.440
Say, I don't wanna think about exercise, it's Sunday.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.239
It means to labor, to strive.

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:10.239
You go and you work out at a gym, you exercise,

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:12.920
you understand the Scriptures say bodily exercise

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.760
profiteth little, there is profit to it,

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:17.739
but when you think about exercising ourselves

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:20.119
rather unto godliness, and you think about

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.720
what Paul says here, and herein do I exercise,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.660
I labor, I strive, do I exercise myself?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.140
What is it, Paul, that you're using this preface

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.119
of this exercise to have what?

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.679
To have always, notice that word always,

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:37.279
not sometimes, not at certain junctures of my life,

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.279
but always a conscience void of offense toward God.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.799
And toward men.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.899
I wanna focus on the first aspect of this

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.920
when Paul says to have always a conscience

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.519
void of offense toward God.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.799
I want you to think about that, void of offense.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:05.220
That means that there's no offense, there's nothing between.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.220
To be void of, Paul says I'm exercising myself

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.559
that always, not at certain junctures of my life,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:18.720
not when someone's looking and someone's expecting,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.399
but always I desire that I would have a conscience

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:28.040
that is void of offense toward God.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.739
And toward men.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.239
I want you to think about what Paul is saying here

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:36.880
before Felix, and I want you to couple it

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.480
with what Paul says in Acts 23 as he's giving his defense

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.359
before the Sanhedrin.

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:44.079
And I really believe that the statement that he makes

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.920
before the Sanhedrin, and the statement that he makes

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.619
before Felix, as we understand what he says,

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:54.359
and it gives us clearer insight as to how he could make

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.679
the statement before the Sanhedrin in Acts 23

00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:58.359
in verse number one, the Bible says,

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:00.239
and Paul, earnestly beholding the council,

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.600
said, men and brethren, notice what he says,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
I have lived in all good conscience before God

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:10.399
until this day.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.239
How could Paul make that statement?

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:14.760
How could Paul say before the Sanhedrin,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.720
he says, men and brethren, I have lived in all good

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.040
conscience before God until this day.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.959
We get this further insight as he's speaking before Felix,

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.119
and he says to Felix, listen, I exercise myself,

00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:31.079
I labor, I strive, this is a purpose,

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:34.559
a goal that I have in my life, and what I'm striving for,

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.400
what I'm laboring for, what I'm exercising for

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.400
is to have always a conscience void of offense

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.039
before God and toward men.

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:50.919
I want you to think about this conscience

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:54.000
that is void of offense toward God.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.840
I want you to consider this morning as we begin to dig in

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.080
and really just meditate upon this thought this morning,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.599
and for Paul to be able to say that he's lived

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:08.719
in all good conscience before God until this day

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:12.000
to the Sanhedrin, I wonder this morning, how is it,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.760
what is it that we should do, what is it that I can do

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.000
in my life to exercise myself so that I could,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.919
as Paul said, that I could have always a conscience

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:27.960
void of offense toward God and toward men.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.440
Is it even possible?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.719
Do we even care?

00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:34.599
See, sometimes what you find in life,

00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:36.200
in fact, Jason Caldwell said this,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.719
he'll be the preacher next week,

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:39.599
but he made this statement several years ago,

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.640
and it had such an impact as I heard him say these words.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.200
He said, my heart is burdened for those

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.359
who have never received truth.

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:48.200
I agree.

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:51.760
He said, but in a greater way, my heart is burdened

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.599
for those that don't want truth.

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.640
I agree.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.039
And sometimes what happens in people's lives

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.440
is we just get comfortable.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.120
comfortable, and we're just comfortable with where we are, and we just say, status

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.300
quo is okay, things are just going okay, and we just become comfortable with it.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.560
And I hope that this morning as we consider this truth in the life of Paul and we begin

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.440
to provide maybe some tips, if you will, some practical tips on how we too can exercise

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.440
ourselves so that we could have always a conscience that is void of offense toward God.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.800
By the way, it is a pleasant thing when there's nothing between my soul and my Savior, amen?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
It was D.L.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.920
Moody that said this, sin will keep me from this book, or this book will keep me from

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920
sin.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920
And what was D.L.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920
Moody saying?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.280
He was saying, listen, if I'm living in sin, if I'm living and I have a hard heart, if

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.360
I have sinful behavior, then there's something between my soul and my Savior, and I don't

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.600
desire to be in His presence like I did before.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.360
I don't desire to be in His book like I did before, because there's sin.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.800
But he says, but this book will keep me from sin, and the closer I get to God, the more

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:09.600
time I spend with my Savior, and the more I go through the process of seeking that cleansing.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.720
I spoke last Sunday morning about having a clean heart.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.319
Not just cleaner, but a clean heart.

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:21.920
Not just taking the fork at the restaurant and seeing the crusties on it and saying,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.319
and just, oh, it's cleaner now than it was.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:25.319
No, no.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.319
I want a clean fork.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.319
I want a clean heart.

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:32.440
Not just cleaner, not just better than the person that's in front of us or behind us

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.920
or someone that is in the workplace, and say, well, we're better than they are.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
No, no.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.819
I want to have a conscience that is void of offense toward God.

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.120
Number one, how can we do this?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.240
Number one, I would say this, examine yourselves.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240
Examine yourselves.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.880
In 1 Corinthians, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter 11, we're familiar with this passage

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.440
of Scripture as we would look at this passage when we observe the Lord's Supper, and I will

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.160
not take the time to read the entirety of the passage of Scripture that deals with the

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.800
Lord's Supper, but we've often mentioned that this passage of Scripture deals with this

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.559
process of self-examination.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:17.220
We talk about the fact that the table, it's a table of remembrance, it's a table of expectation,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
it's a table of examination.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And he says in verse number 28, Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.460
of the church at Corinth, he says, but let a man examine himself, and so let him eat

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.979
of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:35.059
And as we take the first phrase from 1 Corinthians 11 and verse number 28, and we talk about

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:39.540
the process of self-examination, we'd understand this morning that self-examination is both

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.300
biblical and necessary.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.260
It is appropriate for the people of God to go through a process of self-examination.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.500
I will not suggest to you this morning that it's a pleasant process, I will not suggest

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.860
to you this morning that it's something that maybe we just can't wait to go through the

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:01.339
self-examination process, but it's necessary for us, it's biblical, it is appropriate for

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:05.779
God's people to go through a process of self-examination.

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:09.699
And I would say this, when I speak about the process of self-examination, when I say if

00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:14.500
we're going to have nothing between my soul and my Savior, if I'm going to have a conscience

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.740
that is void of offense toward God, that examining myself is necessary, and I would say that

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.940
self-examination, it requires humility.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.580
It requires humility.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.619
We spoke on Wednesday evening about humility and how important it is that we would humble

00:13:31.619 --> 00:13:37.260
ourselves, and humility is the key as we would look at the truth, that promise of 2 Corinthians

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.860
7 and verse number 14, and somebody said this with regard to humility, and I mentioned this

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.460
on Wednesday evening, this past week, with regard to humility, and even used the example

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.900
of Isaiah in Isaiah 6 when he saw God high, holy, and lifted up, and how He was a man

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.339
that was broken and humbled, and someone said this, a sight of God's glory humbles.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.860
We see God in His proper place.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:08.300
And then they likened it to this, they used this analogy, the stars vanish when the sun

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.300
appears, and I like that analogy, I like that illustration, and the reality this morning

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.179
is that we need to get a glimpse of His glory.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:22.260
We think about this process of self-examination, it requires humility, that I'm humbling myself,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.619
it not only requires humility, but it requires honesty, it requires honesty.

00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:32.540
You know, there are times in our lives when we think about this truth of self-examination,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.980
and when we understand that we'd be examined by a greater authority, when we understand

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.899
that that self-examination eventually is going to lead us to what the psalmist says in Psalm

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:48.100
139, search me, O God, that we must recognize the importance of honesty with regard to the

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.100
self-examination.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.940
See, we might be able to overlook something, but God's not.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.260
And so when we think about this process of self-examination requiring humility and requiring

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.500
honesty, here in Romans 12 and verse number 3, the Bible says, for I say, through the

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.980
grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.420
he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.700
of faith.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.980
You know, it's often we live in an era, we live in a time and a place, a culture, where

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.839
many times people think more highly than themselves than they should.

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:26.839
It's commonplace.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:33.200
And unfortunately, if we're not careful this morning, that mentality can creep even into

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.160
the people of God.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:43.360
But we understand this morning that it's necessary, as I would desire, I would echo the words

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:50.420
of Paul, that I'm exercising myself, I'm striving, I'm laboring, so that I might have a conscience

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:57.760
that is void of offense toward God, that I must understand the importance of self-examination.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.619
And that self-examination process is a process.

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:07.299
It is a period of time that we must use and must get alone with God and His Word and allow

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:14.179
His Word to search us, allow the Spirit of God to use the Word of God to reveal to us.

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:21.700
When we think about this truth of self-examination, listen, examination will lead to confession.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:28.580
As we examine ourselves, as we examine our own lives, our own walk with God, as we examine

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:34.899
ourselves in the Word of God using the perfect law of liberty, we find that we use the Word

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:37.459
of God and God will reveal things to us.

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:45.559
By the way, it is a gracious act of God to reveal in our lives sin.

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:46.899
It is gracious of God.

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:49.380
Listen, there are people that say, I don't want my toes stepped on.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.140
No, no, I want God to step on my toes.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.739
I want God to convict me.

00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:55.739
Why?

00:16:55.739 --> 00:16:57.739
Because I want to be closer to my God.

00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:02.660
I want nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.459
As I was preparing this message and as I was preparing the message for this evening,

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.179
there are some places where God has stepped on my toes, and let me say publicly from the

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:19.779
pulpit, it's a good thing, and it's good for you as well, when God steps on our toes, when

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:28.860
God gets us out of our comfort zone, when God reveals to us in our lives sin, when God

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:34.619
points His finger in our lives, see, this self-examination will lead to confession.

00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:38.739
It will lead to that place as I've examined myself, and as I'm going through that process

00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:46.179
using humility and honesty and God begins to reveal things, I then deal with them.

00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:50.980
I don't find a problem and then just kind of brush it under the carpet, so to speak.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.019
Is that not a tendency in our world today?

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:56.339
Let's just kind of pretend like that didn't happen.

00:17:56.339 --> 00:17:57.980
Let's just kind of brush that under the carpet.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.720
Let's just not, no, no, we say, we're going to deal with it.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720
Examination leads to confession.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.059
I'm so thankful for the wonderful promise in 1 John 1 and verse number 9 that if we

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:13.940
confess our sins, He is faithful, He is faithful and just to forgive us, and it says this to

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.339
cleanse us.

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:19.119
Aren't you thankful for the cleansing?

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:24.380
Not only do we think about this process of self-examination, if I'm going to have a conscience

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.059
that is void of offense toward God, if I'm going to have nothing between my soul and

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:31.100
my Savior, I believe that I must examine myself.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.700
Number two, I would say this, I must prove what is acceptable to the Lord.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.780
I must prove what is acceptable to the Lord.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.619
Look over the book of Ephesians, if you will, in the fifth chapter.

00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:47.659
The book of Ephesians is a powerful book that God has given us in the New Testament that

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:52.580
really deals with so much of the Christian life, and you see in these six chapters of

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.099
the book of Ephesians so much that is relating to our walk with Christ.

00:18:57.099 --> 00:19:01.619
Of course, the first three chapters dealing with how we became the people of God, how

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:07.580
we got saved, and dealing with the truth of redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.739
and then in chapters 4, 5, and 6, Paul gets real practical with the believers in Ephesus,

00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:19.080
and he provides this truth with regard to our walk and how we are to walk and walking

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.559
in such a manner that God is pleased.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:29.039
And he says this in Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, he says, proving what is acceptable

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.520
unto the Lord.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.520
I think about what Paul said there in Acts chapter number 24 and verse number 16 when

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.640
he said that he exercises himself, and I said that's labor, that's striving, that's work,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.580
and we find here now that he's saying proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.220
That also is a process.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.179
This is a word that would be used regularly with regard to metal work.

00:19:55.179 --> 00:20:00.380
It's a word that would deal with the purification of metals and getting that metal…

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.380
that pure, that silver that's tried in the fiery furnace

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.460
to get out all of the impurities.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.120
And Paul would use that same word dealing here

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.820
with us as the people of God

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.900
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.180
You say, how in the world do we do that?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.060
By using this book.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.360
Because God has given us a book.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.160
The Bible, the Word of God,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.700
He's preserved it for us.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.740
He's told us that His Word is profitable for us.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.580
And as we take the profitable Word of God,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.300
the powerful Word of God,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.260
and we then go through the process

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.820
of proving what is acceptable to the Lord,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.500
we have the opportunity to determine

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.580
is God pleased with my life?

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.540
So the idea here is when it says proving

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.960
what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.540
You know, the Bible records for us

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.300
and reveals to us in His Word

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.780
that there are periods of time,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.860
there are individuals and groups of people

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.420
the Bible says that God was not well-pleased with them.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.620
I would never want it to be said of my life

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.220
or of our church that God is not well-pleased.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.100
I want to please God.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.780
I want to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.900
And it requires work.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.020
It requires diligence.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.300
It requires that we go through the Word of God.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.420
Again, I would say even as we dealt

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.160
with the subject of examination,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.100
the self-examination,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.660
the requirement for humility and honesty,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.020
the same is true here with regard

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.700
to the proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.300
It requires honesty.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.020
It requires that we would take the Word of God

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.900
and we would determine not what is acceptable

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.460
to my society,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.900
but what is acceptable to my Savior.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.060
Do you acknowledge this morning

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.660
that there's a great difference

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.180
between what is acceptable in our society

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.540
versus what is acceptable to our Savior?

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.940
And sometimes what happens is if we're not careful,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.060
we use the wrong gauge

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.580
to determine what's acceptable behavior.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.560
We might use what someone else is doing

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.680
or what someone else is saying.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.020
We might use what our society, our culture,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.940
what those people in power are saying is acceptable

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.980
instead of using the Word of God.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.380
We find that we live in a time

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.340
in which it's absolutely essential

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.700
that we would prove what is acceptable to the Lord.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.900
I would ask this question.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.900
Does God have preeminence in my life?

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:30.980
The Scriptures tell us in the book of Colossians,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.820
we find that here he tells the believers in Colossians 1,

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.180
the believers in Colossae,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.260
he says that in all things, he, Christ,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.820
the head of the church, might have the preeminence.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.340
Why do we do the things that we do?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.700
You ever ask yourself that question?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.900
Why do we do what we do?

00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:57.620
Well, we need to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.700
So why do we behave in the way that we do?

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.260
Why do we listen to the things that we listen to?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.540
Why do we watch the things that we watch?

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.620
Why do we go to the places that we go to?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.779
Why do we wear the things that we wear?

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:12.860
Why do we talk and use speech, the speech that we use?

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.779
We can just go through the list this morning

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:16.220
and we could go through the whole thing

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.220
and we could say, is this acceptable to God?

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.779
Not is it acceptable to my society,

00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:25.460
not does the culture tell me

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.220
that that's the cool thing to do,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.779
that that's the cute thing to wear,

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:31.620
that that's the hip thing to listen to

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.980
or the right way to talk or whatever it might be,

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.980
but we say, what is acceptable to God?

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.540
What is God pleased with?

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.500
And see, if we truly want there to be nothing

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.260
between my soul and my Savior,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.419
I better look at the importance

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:47.820
of going through this process of proving

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.340
not only self-examination,

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.220
but then proving what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.300
not even deceiving myself,

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.139
not being deceived by others,

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:58.300
but allowing the truth of God's Word

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.340
to prove to me what is pleasing in His sight.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.980
The process will require that honesty and that humility.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.260
Turn over to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.779
I want you to think about this truth.

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:15.380
When we think about proving what is acceptable

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.660
unto the Lord and examining yourselves,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.779
these two things kind of combine this morning

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:23.500
at this particular crossing point,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.300
if you will, of the message.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.540
I mentioned already that the self-examination

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.619
will lead to confession.

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.660
1 Corinthians chapter number three.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.660
And we think about proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.420
And so as I examine myself

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.739
and as I'm proving what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:39.899
the reality is this.

00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:42.980
There should be some things that God is going to point out

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.220
in your life and my life that need to be changed.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.260
Can we be honest this morning?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.980
None of us are perfect.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980
Amen?

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.059
None of us are perfect.

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:55.059
None of us, we've not arrived.

00:24:55.059 --> 00:24:58.580
We're never going to arrive in the Christian life, right?

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.540
Are you there this morning?

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.700
You get it?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.700
We are continually to be growing in our walk with God,

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:07.660
growing in our faith.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.100
And we find that as we are on this journey with Christ,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.260
if you will, that none of us have arrived.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.260
And if we think we have, we're mistaken,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.619
and there's probably bigger problems in our life

00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:24.260
than we'd like to acknowledge.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.860
And so this morning when we examine ourselves

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.339
and when we prove what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:25:31.339 --> 00:25:33.739
God's going to begin dealing with us.

00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:35.540
And there are going to be some specific things

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.980
that God's going to start dealing with

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.100
and he's going to start saying, this needs to change.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.300
You need to stop doing this.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.339
You need to stop going there.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:42.540
You need to stop talking that way,

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.260
watching that thing, listening to that thing,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.739
whatever it might be.

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:47.940
God's going to say, you need to start doing these things

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.179
because these things are what please me.

00:25:50.179 --> 00:25:51.980
And so this is what you need to be doing.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.300
And I'm proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.500
And I'm asking God to show me and grow me

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.260
and to have a conscience that is always

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.220
void of offense toward God.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.059
I don't want to offend God.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.820
And we come to 1 Corinthians 3.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.660
In verse 16 and 17, notice what Paul says here

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660
to these believers.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.580
Now remember, these are believers that are carnal.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.700
These are believers that are contentious.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.500
They're divisions and all sorts of things going on.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.339
And he says to them,

00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:28.739
know ye not that ye are the temple of God

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:31.940
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.580
I dealt with this a couple of Sunday evenings

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.500
ago talking about the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.459
and how thankful I am that the Holy Spirit of God

00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.220
at the moment of salvation indwells us

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.100
and we are the temple of God.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.179
But notice what he says in verse number 17.

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:49.500
If any man defile the temple of God,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.500
him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.660
which temple ye are.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.899
That is powerful language.

00:26:57.899 --> 00:26:59.619
And I think about the correlation.

00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:01.660
If you can, in your mind, we won't go into that.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.300
We won't take time this morning to go there

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.619
and to look at all of the passages,

00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:08.619
but let me just give you some insight.

00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:10.899
If you go back to the book of 2 Chronicles

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:13.380
and you begin to read the history of Israel

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.260
and you begin to see some of the revivals

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.059
that took place under the leadership of Hezekiah

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:20.980
and under the leadership of Josiah,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.459
both of those kings followed wicked kings.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.860
And both of those kings,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.500
as you read those chapters that reveal

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:35.339
what led up to the revival during the reign of Hezekiah,

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:37.100
during the reign of Josiah,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.779
you will see that the Bible speaks

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:41.500
about repairing the house of the Lord.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.380
Specifically in Josiah's account,

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.380
you will read about cleansing the house of God.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.220
And if you were to do some research

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.619
and you were to look at the preceding leadership

00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:55.339
and you would look at the kings,

00:27:55.339 --> 00:27:58.059
the wicked kings that preceded Hezekiah

00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:00.140
and then that preceded Josiah,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.020
you will find that the temple needed to be repaired.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.619
The temple needed to be cleansed.

00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:05.459
Why?

00:28:05.459 --> 00:28:07.540
Because it was defiled.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.540
And the doors of the temple were shut up.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.339
And we find that idolatry was prevalent.

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:16.500
And you'd find that the nation of Judah

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.220
was dealing with the judgment of God

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.619
because of their defilement,

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:22.940
because of their sin,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.980
because of their wickedness.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.459
And we see that in Hezekiah's reign.

00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:29.619
We see that in Josiah's reign.

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:31.580
And then we come to the life and ministry

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.820
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.260
And His public ministry begins chronologically,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.140
if you were to look at it,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.299
in John chapter number two.

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:40.580
And in John chapter number two,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.220
when it talks about this is the beginning of miracles,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.020
right after the miracle at the marriage at Cana,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.859
you read about Jesus going into the temple

00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:52.619
and turning over the tables and driving people out.

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:53.460
Why?

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.179
Because they had made His house

00:28:55.179 --> 00:28:58.580
a house of not what it was to be, of prayer,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.900
not to be a place where,

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.340
how God had established it to be,

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.099
but they're trading money

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:05.059
and they were selling things.

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:06.500
And all of this that was taking place

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.820
with the money changers.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.099
And you see that Jesus,

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:11.059
at the beginning of His earthly ministry,

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:13.260
He goes in signifying

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.700
that the temple needed to be cleansed.

00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:18.340
And by the way,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.460
they asked Him what authority He had to do that.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.299
And then He says,

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:22.380
destroy this temple.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.780
And in three days, I'll raise it up again.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.619
And they said,

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:26.940
oh man, you must be mistaken.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.099
But He was speaking about the temple of His body,

00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:32.140
of His resurrection after His death.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.460
Great truth in John 2,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.380
the beginning of His ministry.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.780
I believe it's in Matthew 21.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.500
It's also recorded in the book of Luke,

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.220
but you'll read near the end

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.460
of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.419
that once again, He enters into the temple

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:48.780
and He turns over the tables again.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.660
It happens twice in the ministry

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.059
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:52.059 --> 00:29:53.460
At the start of His ministry

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.020
and at the end of His ministry,

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.340
His earthly ministry was but about three years,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.739
three and a half years.

00:29:59.739 --> 00:30:02.699
And you find that again at the end of His earthly ministry,

00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:03.399
He is going in.

00:30:03.399 --> 00:30:03.899
Why?

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:07.539
Because the temple had been defiled.

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.019
And what is it that we learn?

00:30:09.019 --> 00:30:12.019
We learn the importance of ensuring

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:14.779
that the temple is not defiled.

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:17.419
But when we speak about the truth that

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:21.579
is given as Paul is speaking to these believers in the church,

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:24.539
and as we have the precious Word of God this morning,

00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:29.579
that God has said, listen, you are the temple of God.

00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:31.459
Our bodies, we have.

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:35.059
He says, know ye not that ye are the temple of God,

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:40.179
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:43.939
We better not defile the temple.

00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:46.819
I must examine myself.

00:30:46.819 --> 00:30:50.739
I must prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:54.019
And let me say, if you were to take time every day this week

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:59.419
to do these two things, to put the truth this morning

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:02.299
into practice in your life, and you would take that time

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:06.659
to honestly and humbly examine ourselves and prove

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:08.179
what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:10.339
when we begin to take that remote control

00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:14.179
and turn on that TV or listen to that thing or wear that thing

00:31:14.179 --> 00:31:17.939
or whatever it might be, we say, is this pleasing to God?

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:23.739
Is this pleasing to God?

00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:26.739
I want to have a conscience that is always

00:31:26.739 --> 00:31:30.859
void of offense toward God.

00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:33.979
That's a powerful statement.

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:38.699
It's a powerful statement that is made that Paul is saying,

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:40.299
listen, this is how I live.

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:42.739
I exercise myself.

00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:45.539
I go through the labor.

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:46.979
I'm striving for this.

00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:47.499
Why?

00:31:47.499 --> 00:31:49.499
Because it's worth it.

00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:51.099
It's worth being in a place where

00:31:51.099 --> 00:31:53.859
there's nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:31:53.859 --> 00:31:55.779
It's worth being in a place where

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:59.219
I have a conscience that is always void of offense

00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:02.059
toward God and toward men.

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:09.339
Do you know what it is to have an offense between someone

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:11.219
personally?

00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:13.939
There's something between you and someone else.

00:32:13.939 --> 00:32:14.979
Maybe it's a spouse.

00:32:14.979 --> 00:32:16.819
Maybe it's a parent, a child.

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:18.899
Maybe it's a co-worker.

00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:20.419
But when there is an offense, when

00:32:20.419 --> 00:32:23.859
there's a problem between us, humanly speaking,

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.659
there's some things that that offense does

00:32:26.659 --> 00:32:31.499
that impacts our behavior, right?

00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:34.739
Do you avoid the individual?

00:32:34.739 --> 00:32:37.099
Probably.

00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:37.819
Why?

00:32:37.819 --> 00:32:40.899
Because there's something between.

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:42.999
There's a problem.

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:45.059
I'm not glad to see them.

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:48.259
I'm not going out of my way to invite them for coffee.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:50.139
I'm not having them to my house for dinner.

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:56.499
Sometimes it happens in the marriage relationship.

00:32:56.499 --> 00:32:58.899
Let's be honest this morning.

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:00.979
Listen, if we are not right with our spouse,

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.459
if we're not right with each other,

00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:03.499
we're not right with God.

00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:09.779
I've been preaching this for 1 John as we studied this year.

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:12.339
Listen, God says, don't tell me that you love me,

00:33:12.339 --> 00:33:15.539
but you hate your brother, right?

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:18.239
It's what he says.

00:33:19.219 --> 00:33:22.199
If I'm going to be right with God

00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:26.879
and have a conscience that is void of offense,

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:30.239
we know what an offense between us as human beings,

00:33:30.239 --> 00:33:33.479
how it impacts our relationship.

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:35.159
There's a preacher that stood, I think,

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:38.359
dad, you were at the pastor's meeting with us back in May.

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:40.319
But I think it was a year ago, May,

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:42.119
when that guy got up and preached.

00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:44.479
And he said that he's never raised his voice to his wife

00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:46.759
one time in 35 years of marriage or something,

00:33:46.759 --> 00:33:47.999
never had one argument.

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:49.399
Some of the ladies are saying, yeah, right,

00:33:49.399 --> 00:33:50.239
give me a break.

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.599
And then he went on to say this.

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:56.359
He said, there've been times where I haven't spoken

00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:57.559
to my wife for days.

00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:00.519
Well, that's not right either.

00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:03.359
It's commendable that you didn't raise your voice

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:05.999
to your wife, that you didn't say a harsh word to your wife,

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:07.719
but it's not right that you would give her

00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:08.839
the silent treatment.

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:11.239
You ever, you know what I'm talking about?

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.979
Trying to be helpful this morning.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.579
Because we know what it is when there's an offense

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:19.979
between us as human beings.

00:34:19.979 --> 00:34:22.979
So why would we think that if there's a conscience

00:34:22.979 --> 00:34:24.819
that's not void of offense,

00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:26.779
why would we think that our fellowship with God

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:29.220
is gonna be what it's supposed to be?

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.859
It's going to impact us.

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:34.299
And so it's absolutely essential

00:34:35.479 --> 00:34:39.519
that we would come to this place where Paul does in Acts 23

00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:41.699
before the Sanhedrin, and then in Acts 24,

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.579
when he gives us more insight before Felix,

00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:47.259
when he says, listen, I exercise myself.

00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:52.380
I'm striving, I'm laboring to have always a conscience

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.380
that is void of offense toward God and toward men.

00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:03.179
I want nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:04.459
How do we ensure that?

00:35:04.459 --> 00:35:05.459
What do we do?

00:35:05.459 --> 00:35:07.380
How can we be in that place?

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.819
Well, I wanna examine myself.

00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:12.899
And I must be honest about it.

00:35:12.899 --> 00:35:14.519
I must have humility.

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:19.000
Then I wanna prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.940
Say, God, is this pleasing to you?

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:27.619
Is this what I should be doing?

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:30.579
Is this how I should be doing it?

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:32.220
God, help me.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.079
Help me to be sensitive to your leadership.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:38.440
God, as I go through my day, as I go through my life,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.679
as I go through my week, would you help me to be sensitive

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.919
to how I'm living and why I'm doing what I'm doing?

00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:50.519
And is it pleasing in your sight?

00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:52.720
And then finally this morning, number three,

00:35:53.979 --> 00:35:58.979
simple stuff, be doers of the word, be doers of the word.

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:03.119
See, when I examine myself and I prove

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.039
what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:08.039
then I have to implement it, I have to do it.

00:36:08.039 --> 00:36:09.959
I have to take action.

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:13.160
See, it's not enough to know what's right.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.399
We have to know it and do it.

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:19.799
By the way, there's a lot of people that know what's right.

00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:21.479
There's some people that are lost

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:24.440
that can tell you how you should live as a Christian.

00:36:26.799 --> 00:36:27.639
Right?

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:30.079
There's some people that sit in the pew

00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:32.639
that can tell a pastor how they should be a pastor.

00:36:33.899 --> 00:36:35.739
There are some pastors that can tell church members

00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:37.479
how they should be church members.

00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:39.059
There are some husbands that can tell wives

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:39.899
how to be wives.

00:36:39.899 --> 00:36:41.619
And there's some wives that can tell husbands

00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:42.699
how to be husbands.

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:44.099
You understand what I'm saying?

00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:47.799
A lot of people that know or think they know.

00:36:49.259 --> 00:36:50.959
But it's not enough to just know.

00:36:51.859 --> 00:36:52.739
We have to do.

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:54.799
James says this in James one.

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:57.819
Again, this is simple truth this morning.

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:04.160
But sometimes it's the simple things that we miss.

00:37:04.679 --> 00:37:08.639
James one in verse 22.

00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:11.679
We've read the verse.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.720
I've quoted a portion of the verse 1,000 times as I pray.

00:37:19.959 --> 00:37:24.959
But be doers of the word and not hearers only,

00:37:25.759 --> 00:37:27.639
deceiving your own selves.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:33.279
For if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer,

00:37:33.279 --> 00:37:35.399
he's likened to a man beholding his natural face

00:37:35.399 --> 00:37:36.239
in a glass.

00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:38.239
Some of you have looked in the mirror this morning.

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:43.279
It says, for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way

00:37:43.279 --> 00:37:46.179
and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:51.039
That's the one that's a hearer but not a doer.

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:55.399
Jesus in the book of Matthew in the seventh chapter,

00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:59.359
he gives the truth with regard to the wise man

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.359
and the foolish man.

00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:04.079
And I want you to understand this morning

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:06.199
that in Matthew chapter number seven,

00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:08.880
when he gives that truth,

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.160
both of the groups of individuals,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.279
people that he's referring to,

00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:15.319
they heard the same message.

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:17.039
It wasn't in the hearing of the word.

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:19.160
By the way, Jesus is the master teacher.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:23.819
It was in their response.

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:26.919
The foolish man was the man that heard but didn't do.

00:38:26.919 --> 00:38:29.279
The wise man was the man that heard and did.

00:38:29.279 --> 00:38:31.319
He implemented, he obeyed.

00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:33.039
See, when I think about being a doer of the word,

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:36.159
I must determine that I'm going to agree with God.

00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:37.599
I must acknowledge this morning

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:40.440
that his word is profitable for me today,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.080
that he said all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.880
and is profitable,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.440
that God gave me his word to help me

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.520
and it's always best for me to follow his word.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.739
How often are the failures of God's people,

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:57.320
as we would trace back and examine

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.679
the failures of God's people,

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:01.320
can they be traced back to a failure

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.880
to obey the word of God?

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:10.779
Notice what Moses said to the people of Israel.

00:39:10.779 --> 00:39:13.080
Turn with you to Deuteronomy chapter four.

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.239
As they're preparing for entrance

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:18.559
into the land of promise,

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:21.520
we find that there are two powerful statements

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.739
that are given to the children of Israel

00:39:23.739 --> 00:39:26.459
with regard to the obedience to the word of God.

00:39:26.459 --> 00:39:28.940
And again, I'm thankful that God's given us his word.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.020
What a blessing.

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:36.159
I'm thankful that we have the right Bible.

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:37.940
Amen?

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:41.419
But if we're not reading it and doing it,

00:39:41.419 --> 00:39:43.899
we can argue about the right version and the right Bible

00:39:43.899 --> 00:39:47.059
until the cows come home, as they say.

00:39:47.059 --> 00:39:48.859
But the reality is that we need to be reading it

00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:51.859
and studying it and doing it, obeying it.

00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:54.020
And here's what Moses says to these

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:57.260
that he's called to give instruction to

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.380
as they would then enter into the land of promise.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.219
In Deuteronomy.

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:02.719
before in verse number 40, notice what he says,

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:04.979
"'Thou shalt keep them,' excuse me,

00:40:04.979 --> 00:40:07.799
"'keep therefore his statutes and his commandments,

00:40:07.799 --> 00:40:09.059
"'which I command thee this day.'"

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:10.359
Then notice this phrase,

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:15.939
"'That it may go well with thee

00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:18.519
"'and with thy children after thee,

00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:21.079
"'and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth,

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:24.439
"'which the Lord thy God giveth thee forever.'"

00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:27.559
How many of us want that center promise

00:40:27.559 --> 00:40:29.799
that it may go well with thee?

00:40:29.799 --> 00:40:31.399
That's what we desire, right?

00:40:32.439 --> 00:40:34.199
But he says here, "'Thou shalt keep therefore

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:35.539
"'his statutes and his commandments,

00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:36.959
"'which I command thee this day,

00:40:36.959 --> 00:40:38.599
"'that it may go well with thee

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:40.519
"'and with thy children after thee.'"

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:43.079
Were there troubles that the nation of Israel faced

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:44.559
as we study their history?

00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:47.799
Absolutely, and as you trace back their failures,

00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:49.559
you know that you can trace them back

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:52.599
to a failure to obey the word of God.

00:40:52.599 --> 00:40:55.359
Deuteronomy chapter number six and verse number 24,

00:40:55.359 --> 00:40:57.199
notice the phrase that he uses here

00:40:57.199 --> 00:40:58.839
in this text of scripture.

00:41:00.139 --> 00:41:01.859
In Deuteronomy six and verse 24, he says,

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:05.079
"'And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:07.079
"'to fear the Lord our God,''

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:11.279
notice this phrase, "'for our good always,

00:41:11.279 --> 00:41:14.959
"'that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day.'"

00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:17.599
For our good always.

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:19.919
Listen, the word of God is profitable for us,

00:41:19.919 --> 00:41:23.359
and we find that it's always in our best interest

00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:27.519
to follow the word of God, to obey what God has said.

00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:30.279
Peter is speaking, and remember that Peter,

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:32.359
he was at the Mount of Transfiguration,

00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:34.439
he saw the Lord Jesus Christ in his glory,

00:41:34.439 --> 00:41:36.279
he heard the voice of God,

00:41:36.279 --> 00:41:39.599
and we find that Peter is writing to the believers

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:41.359
in 2 Peter, and he says that we have

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:44.239
a more sure word of prophecy.

00:41:44.239 --> 00:41:45.999
And he's speaking about the word of God

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:47.919
and how thankful we are for it,

00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:52.919
but he says this, "'Ye do well that ye take heed.'"

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:55.959
In 2 Peter one and verse number 19.

00:41:56.879 --> 00:41:59.839
It's like that little chorus that we've sang over the years,

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:02.479
"'I'll say yes, Lord, yes.

00:42:04.479 --> 00:42:05.719
"'To your will and to your way,

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:08.679
"'I'll say yes, Lord, yes, I will trust you and obey.

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:10.959
"'When your spirit speaks to me,

00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:15.079
"'with my whole heart, I'll agree,

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:20.079
"'and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.'"

00:42:20.959 --> 00:42:22.639
It's a good little chorus.

00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:25.239
But it's not just a song that we sing,

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:26.839
it's a prayer that we pray.

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:31.119
Lord, I wanna be a doer of your word,

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:32.639
I want you to speak to me,

00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:35.719
I want you to show me areas

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:40.039
in which I have not done something,

00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:41.559
that I've not lived in such a way

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.919
that it's pleasing in your sight.

00:42:43.919 --> 00:42:46.639
God, reveal it to me, show me,

00:42:46.639 --> 00:42:48.719
and help me to deal with it.

00:42:50.799 --> 00:42:52.199
Because if I'm going to have nothing

00:42:52.199 --> 00:42:53.919
between my soul and my Savior,

00:42:53.919 --> 00:42:56.919
or as Paul says it in Acts chapter 24,

00:42:56.919 --> 00:42:58.599
in verse number 16,

00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:00.279
if I'm going to have a conscience

00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:03.039
that is void of offense toward God,

00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:06.679
I must exercise myself

00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:09.359
so that I could have always

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:13.519
a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:15.999
I do not think it's going to happen on accident,

00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:19.839
that there'll be nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:43:19.879 --> 00:43:21.959
We must be active,

00:43:21.959 --> 00:43:24.999
we must be desirous

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:27.519
to be in that place where we say,

00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:29.879
I have nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:34.599
Listen, if you wanna compete with,

00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:36.439
you think about this word exercise,

00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:38.679
you wanna compete in some sporting event,

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:40.599
you wanna get into some shape,

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:42.999
listen, it's not good enough to buy a treadmill.

00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:47.999
I won't ask how many of us have treadmills,

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:51.399
or exercise equipment,

00:43:52.399 --> 00:43:53.319
but it's not good enough

00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:55.439
to have exercise equipment in our house.

00:43:57.039 --> 00:43:59.999
Gotta use it, right?

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:01.839
Oh, I got a treadmill.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.079
I've been to places,

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:04.599
I don't know that I've been to any of your houses,

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:05.799
but I've been to places

00:44:06.879 --> 00:44:09.999
where I've seen treadmills with boxes stacked on it.

00:44:11.799 --> 00:44:13.279
It's a good storage place.

00:44:14.679 --> 00:44:17.679
Clothes rack, right?

00:44:17.679 --> 00:44:20.239
Is it serving its intended purpose?

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:21.239
Is it helping you?

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:23.359
No.

00:44:24.439 --> 00:44:26.199
Just because you have a treadmill,

00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:29.159
doesn't mean anything.

00:44:29.159 --> 00:44:30.799
I got a gym membership.

00:44:31.879 --> 00:44:35.119
That's good, that means you're paying somebody,

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:36.679
and they're going to the bank.

00:44:37.919 --> 00:44:38.759
Right?

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:41.319
You gotta go to the gym.

00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:45.439
Exercise, we understand it physically,

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:50.119
but Paul says herein, do I exercise myself?

00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:52.439
He's not talking about something physical,

00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:54.279
he's talking about spiritual,

00:44:54.279 --> 00:44:55.799
and that what he's striving for,

00:44:55.799 --> 00:44:57.839
what he's laboring for,

00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:01.799
is to have always a conscience

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:04.999
that is void of offense

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:08.559
toward God and toward men.

00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:11.439
I hope this morning that we'd say,

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:13.399
I want that.

00:45:14.399 --> 00:45:19.399
I want there to be nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:45:20.559 --> 00:45:21.959
I'm gonna be right with God.

00:45:23.519 --> 00:45:28.119
Three practical tips on how we can be revival ready

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:31.679
by having nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:33.599
Examine yourself.

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:37.639
Proof, proof what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:39.479
and then be a doer of the word.

00:45:39.479 --> 00:45:40.319
Let's pray.

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:44.519
Father, thank You for loving us.

00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:47.319
We love You, but we know that we love You

00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:49.199
because You first loved us.

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:57.159
God, I'm thankful for Your word.

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:00.319
I pray this morning,

00:46:02.319 --> 00:46:05.999
as we read this profound statement

00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:08.959
as Paul is giving his defense before Felix.

00:46:10.999 --> 00:46:13.839
You'd use Your word in the hearts of Your people.

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:20.119
God, help us to desire to have always a conscience

00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:23.799
that is void of offense toward God, toward man.

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:30.119
Lord, that there'd be nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:46:31.279 --> 00:46:33.599
We'd walk in sweet fellowship with You,

00:46:34.799 --> 00:46:36.199
proving what is acceptable,

00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:38.679
not to our society, but to our Savior.

00:46:39.679 --> 00:46:43.679
God, I pray in these moments of invitation,

00:46:43.679 --> 00:46:46.439
the Holy Spirit of God would take the truth of Your word

00:46:46.439 --> 00:46:48.639
and minister to hearts as only You can.

00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:53.119
God, help us in this moment to be doers of the word.

00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:57.079
Lord, help us in this moment to make commitments to You.

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:02.599
I pray that You would work, that You'd be glorified.

00:47:02.599 --> 00:47:04.239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
