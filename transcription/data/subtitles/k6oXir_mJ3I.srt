1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,279
Morning, 1 John chapter number three,

2
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,039
be looking at verses 19 through 24.

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,280
Really, the thought is continued

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,699
from our study two weeks ago.

5
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,319
Last week was Father's Day,

6
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,800
we're in the book of Jeremiah and the book of Ezekiel.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,880
But two weeks ago, we looked at 1 John 3,

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,440
verses 11 through 18, and we used as our title

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,659
for that message two weeks ago from verse number 18,

10
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:22,959
that we're to love in deed and in truth.

11
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,760
And we mentioned this as we studied

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,479
that portion of scripture,

13
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,760
that the thought, the truth of our loved one

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,439
for another is a thought, a truth that is revisited

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,319
by John here in this little epistle

16
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,799
of 1 John over and over.

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,639
We find the emphasis that is placed

18
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:41,860
upon this subject matter,

19
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,840
the importance of the subject matter.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
And as we look at verses 19 through 24,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,159
and really finish up chapter number three this morning,

22
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,319
we find that God again continues to give us this truth

23
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,439
with regard to loving the brethren.

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,319
And as we look at the text of scripture,

25
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,400
notice if you will, in verse number 19,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,880
the Bible says this,

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
and hereby we know that we are of the truth

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,279
and shall assure our hearts before him.

29
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,680
For if our heart condemn us,

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,519
God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,199
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,

32
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:20,000
then have we confidence toward God.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,480
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,639
because we keep his commandments

35
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:27,760
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,959
And this is his commandment,

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,239
that we should believe on the name of his son, Jesus Christ,

38
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,400
and love one another as he gave us commandment.

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,199
And he that keepeth his commandments

40
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:42,080
dwelleth in him and he in him.

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,120
And hereby we know that he abideth in us

42
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,199
by the spirit which he hath given us.

43
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:50,720
What a powerful passage of scripture,

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,300
these few verses to end 1 John chapter number three.

45
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,120
I've titled the message this morning,

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,519
The Blessings of Obedience.

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,040
As you read the word of God, as you study the scriptures,

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,760
you will find that there is a principle,

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,480
you'll discover the principle over and over

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,000
throughout the scriptures that God blesses obedience.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,639
And you'll find that principle established

52
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,160
throughout the word of God.

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,600
You'll find specifically where we find Moses

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,399
standing before the children of Israel

55
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,520
just before they would enter into the land of promise.

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
And he says, I set before you today

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
a blessing and a curse.

58
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,419
And we find that God blesses obedience,

59
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,619
but we also find on the other hand,

60
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:36,360
that disobedience will lead to judgment and cursing.

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,720
We find as you study the word of God,

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,440
as you study in the Old Testament specifically

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,520
with the nation of Israel, unfortunately far too often,

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,119
you will find that blessings are forfeited.

65
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,960
Why?

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,919
Because of disobedience.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,279
The blessings that God desired

68
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,199
to pour out upon His people.

69
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,800
I was reading this morning

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,360
and let me just share with you this truth from Psalm 81.

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,619
The Bible tells us that God was working on their behalf,

72
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,600
that they called and troubled

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,479
and I delivered thee in verse number seven.

74
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,500
I answered thee in the secret place of thunder.

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,000
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah, Sila.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,080
But I want you to notice what God says in verse 10.

77
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,880
He says, I am the Lord thy God,

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,679
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.

79
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:29,039
Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it,

80
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,039
but my people would not hearken to my voice.

81
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,160
And Israel would none of me.

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Isn't that a sad verse of Scripture

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,039
in Psalm 81 in verse number 11.

84
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,360
So here's the consequence.

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,899
It says, so I gave them up unto their own hearts lust

86
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,320
and they walked in their own councils.

87
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,679
Notice the heart of God in verse 13.

88
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,839
Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me

89
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,039
and Israel had walked in my ways.

90
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,100
That's obedience, correct?

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,600
Notice what God says would have happened in verse number 14.

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,919
I should soon have subdued their enemies

93
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,039
and turn my hand against their adversaries.

94
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,399
The Bible tells us in Psalm 78

95
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:16,940
that the people of God limited the Holy One of Israel.

96
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,980
We find that throughout the Scriptures,

97
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,359
unfortunately, many times the blessings of God

98
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,220
are forfeited due to disobedience.

99
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,500
God has graciously given us the Word of God,

100
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,859
the precious Bible,

101
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,380
and as we hold the book in our hands this morning,

102
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,920
as we read and study from this precious book,

103
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,820
we find that God has given us instruction.

104
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,299
And as he's provided instruction for us,

105
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,859
his desire is that we would take

106
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,459
and we would hear it and learn it and do it,

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,019
that we would be doers of the Word,

108
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,019
that we would obey the commands.

109
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,700
The reality is that it is in our best interest to obey God.

110
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,260
And we find that here in the text of Scripture,

111
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,459
it's interesting as the truth is laid out for us

112
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,059
with regard to the commandment of the Lord.

113
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,779
In verse number 23 of our text,

114
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,540
it says singularly,

115
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,820
commandment that we should believe

116
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,899
on the name of his Son, Jesus Christ,

117
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:14,660
and love one another as he gave us commandment.

118
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,779
Believing on Christ and loving the brethren

119
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,459
are so connected that they're referenced here

120
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,320
in verse number 23 as a single commandment.

121
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,260
It's interesting because in verse 22,

122
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,579
in verse number 24,

123
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,880
you'll find that he uses the word plural.

124
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,700
He uses commandments plural.

125
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,899
And we find that in verse number 22,

126
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,859
notice if you will at the end of the verse,

127
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:40,380
it says because we keep his commandments

128
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,359
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

129
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,980
I have in the margin of my Bible a question.

130
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,420
Am I?

131
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Are we?

132
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,260
Am I keeping his commandments?

133
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,579
Am I doing those things that are pleasing in his sight?

134
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,399
If I do not know his commandments,

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,339
I cannot be doing his commandments.

136
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,339
If I do not know what pleases him,

137
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,779
I cannot be doing that which pleases him.

138
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,619
And so we find that it's in this book

139
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,179
that he reveals to us the precious truth,

140
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,959
the instruction to live by.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,959
And we can take the commandments,

142
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,040
the instructions that he's provided us with,

143
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,480
and we can know that we're living our lives

144
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,880
in such a way that we would be pleasing in his sight.

145
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
He says in verse number 24,

146
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,559
and he that keepeth his commandments.

147
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,720
And so we see that in verse 22, 23, and 24,

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
there is reference,

149
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,839
obvious reference to the obedient believer,

150
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,380
to the one that is doing the will of God.

151
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,779
We find that in verse number 22,

152
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,059
excuse me, verse number 23,

153
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,140
as we've mentioned by way of introduction,

154
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,440
that he says this is his commandment,

155
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,660
the first aspect that we should believe

156
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,980
on the name of his son, Jesus Christ.

157
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,140
You understand this morning,

158
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,640
this is the will of God for mankind to be saved.

159
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,440
We find that throughout the scriptures,

160
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,459
we find that the Lord is not willing that any should perish,

161
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,579
but that all should come to repentance.

162
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,619
We find the truth that Paul, as he stands there in Acts 17,

163
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,220
he says in the times of this ignorance,

164
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,179
God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere

165
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:18,140
to repent, to believe, the Bible says,

166
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,519
on the name of his son, Jesus Christ.

167
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,380
I'm so thankful for the name of Jesus.

168
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,500
We sing the song about how wonderful his name is.

169
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,299
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

170
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,059
And when you hear the name Jesus,

171
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,140
there are certain thoughts

172
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,019
that come into your mind immediately.

173
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,019
If you're like me, if you hear someone use

174
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,399
the name of our wonderful Savior in vain,

175
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,119
it grieves my spirit, it grieves my heart.

176
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,839
Why? Because that's my Savior.

177
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,359
That's my Lord.

178
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,880
That's my King.

179
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
And that's my Redeemer.

180
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,920
And we find this morning that it's his will

181
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,019
that mankind be saved.

182
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,760
In like manner, we find that it is his will

183
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,760
that his people, his children, love one another.

184
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,600
This has been the broad theme of this section

185
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,880
of the third chapter of the book of 1 John.

186
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,679
And as we've thought about this broad theme

187
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:14,600
and understanding the commandment of the Lord,

188
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,339
the instruction that has been given,

189
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,899
we've referenced John 13 a number of times,

190
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,959
but let me remind you what Jesus would say

191
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,519
a couple of chapters later in John 15,

192
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,040
in verse 12, he says,

193
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,640
this is my commandment that you love one another

194
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,619
as I have loved you.

195
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,239
Isn't that simple?

196
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,919
He says in verse 17,

197
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,479
these things I command you that you love one another.

198
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,679
I mean, multiple times in just a short period of time

199
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,520
and as it's recorded in the book of the Gospel of John,

200
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,020
do we find that Jesus is telling his disciples

201
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,239
that they're to love one another.

202
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,280
This is God's will.

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,159
This is God's command.

204
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,099
I mentioned last, two weeks ago,

205
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,359
that Peter says it this way,

206
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,659
that we're to have fervent charity one toward another.

207
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,960
We find that as we studied on Wednesday evening,

208
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,059
as we're studying through the book of Philemon,

209
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,940
that Paul mentions as he's beginning to write to Philemon,

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,780
and he's not even gotten to the meat of the message,

211
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,799
but he says to him in verse number five,

212
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,960
hearing of thy love and faith,

213
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,500
which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,119
and toward all saints.

215
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:26,000
And how imperative it is that we love our Lord

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,599
and that we love the brethren.

217
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,359
We said it this way on Wednesday evening,

218
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Philemon loved the Savior and he loved the saints.

219
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,940
And we find here in 1 John 3,

220
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,219
in these verses of Scripture in verses 19 through 24,

221
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:43,359
that he's speaking about the obedience

222
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,580
that we would trust the Lord Jesus Christ,

223
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,500
that we would believe in verse number 23

224
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
on the name of his Son Jesus Christ,

225
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,380
accepting him as our personal Savior

226
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,219
and then loving the brethren.

227
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,359
Someone said it this way,

228
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,219
if we believe in his name,

229
00:09:57,219 --> 00:10:00,179
we will behave in his nature.

230
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,979
We're to be like Christ, are we not?

231
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,559
We're to be like Him.

232
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,679
And we find that as we look at the text of Scripture,

233
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,479
the connection is obvious in v. 19.

234
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,479
The Bible says,

235
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,979
and hereby, by this,

236
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,479
by the content of what we've been dealing with,

237
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:20,179
and we know that He's speaking of the love for the brethren

238
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,359
in v. 10 down through v. 18,

239
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,559
and by this, and hereby,

240
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,679
we know, we see that word again

241
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,059
in the book of 1 John,

242
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,059
this knowledge that God desires for us to have,

243
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,059
this confidence, this assurance,

244
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,559
and He wants us to know.

245
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,059
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro.

246
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,559
He doesn't want us to wander from day to day.

247
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,059
He wants us to know,

248
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,059
and He says, by this, and hereby,

249
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,559
we know that we are of the truth,

250
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,559
and shall assure our hearts before Him.

251
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,059
Aren't you thankful for the birthmarks,

252
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,559
the truth that God gives us,

253
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,059
how we can know what He wants us to know.

254
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,559
We can know that we are of the truth.

255
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,559
I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

256
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,559
that there are three distinct blessings

257
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,559
that are identified for us

258
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,559
in these few verses of Scripture

259
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,559
that are the result of obedience.

260
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,559
You think about this.

261
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,059
I find in my own life,

262
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,059
and I find in the lives of those that I interact with,

263
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,559
most people want blessings.

264
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,559
Amen?

265
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,559
I've actually never met anyone that said,

266
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,559
you know, sign me up for cursings.

267
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,059
I want judgment.

268
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,059
I want to go through...

269
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,059
No, I've never just met anyone that has that perspective.

270
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,559
People say, I want the blessings.

271
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,559
We want the result.

272
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,559
But sometimes what we struggle with is the process,

273
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,059
because the result comes through obedience.

274
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,559
We want the result,

275
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,559
but we must understand the process.

276
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,559
God says the blessings come

277
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,559
as a result of the obedience.

278
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Let me say this,

279
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,559
just even as we start this morning,

280
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,559
you understand that not everything that we look at in life

281
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,559
as being a blessing is really a blessing.

282
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,059
Sometimes we have a skewed perspective

283
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,059
of what a blessing is.

284
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,559
You know, sometimes a difficulty is a blessing.

285
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,559
Not all blessings are the same shape or size.

286
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,559
Amen?

287
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,559
Sometimes there's a difficulty that God brings in your life,

288
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,559
and it's a blessing.

289
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,559
And if we're not careful, we don't look at it as a blessing.

290
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,559
But sometimes there might be.

291
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,559
Listen, you know, the devil offered Jesus all sorts of things

292
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,559
if he'd bow down and worship Him.

293
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,559
He is the God of this world,

294
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,559
the little g God of this world.

295
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,559
And sometimes we begin to look at success in the world,

296
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,559
we begin to look at monetary things and say,

297
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,559
look at all these blessings.

298
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
Well, we better be careful.

299
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,559
I'm not saying they're not blessings,

300
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,559
but I'm simply saying we ought to be able to identify

301
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,559
the true blessings of God.

302
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,559
What is true success?

303
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,559
What is true prosperity from the perspective of God?

304
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,559
It's doing the will of God.

305
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,559
And hearing at the end, well done, how good and faithful servant.

306
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,559
It's living a life that counts for Jesus.

307
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,559
And we find here in this text of Scripture, again,

308
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,559
three blessings.

309
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,559
First of all, I would say the blessing of assurance.

310
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,559
In verse 19, 20, and 21,

311
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,559
we read about this subject, really, of assurance

312
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,559
and this blessing of assurance.

313
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,559
We sing the song, it's number 51 in our songbook,

314
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,559
blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.

315
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,559
Isn't it a wonderful song?

316
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,559
It's a wonderful hymn.

317
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,559
And we find here the blessing of assurance.

318
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,559
Notice what the Bible says,

319
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,559
and hereby we know this confidence, this assurance.

320
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,559
We know that we are of the truth

321
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,559
and shall assure our hearts before him.

322
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,559
It's interesting because he begins to deal with the heart

323
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,559
in verse number 19, and then he deals with it

324
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,559
in verse 20 and 21.

325
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,559
Notice in verse number 20, he says,

326
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,559
if our heart condemn us,

327
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,559
he says in verse number 21,

328
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,559
if our heart condemn us not.

329
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,559
The reality is that there are times in which

330
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,559
we look at and understand as we live life

331
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,559
that there are times in which we'll experience conviction

332
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,559
in our lives.

333
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,559
There are times in which we'll have that heart

334
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,559
that is experiencing conviction.

335
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,559
He talks about condemning,

336
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,559
if our heart condemn us in verse number 20,

337
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,559
if our heart condemn us not.

338
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,559
And really, I believe that as we look at

339
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,559
the passage of scripture, what John is really getting at

340
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,559
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

341
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,559
is that God gives us this blessing of assurance

342
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,559
that we might have a confident heart,

343
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,559
not a condemning heart.

344
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,559
Now let me say this,

345
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,559
as we understand the whole of scripture,

346
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,559
we do understand that the heart is deceitful.

347
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,559
The Bible tells us that plainly in Jeremiah chapter 17.

348
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,559
We find that the heart is deceitful,

349
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,559
and we also know this,

350
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,559
that our walk with God

351
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,559
is not solely based upon our feelings.

352
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,559
There are some that would lead you to believe

353
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,559
that it's all about your feelings and how you feel,

354
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,559
but the reality is that I am so thankful this morning

355
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,559
that my salvation, my assurance,

356
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,559
is not based on my feelings day by day.

357
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,559
Amen?

358
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,559
Someone told me this morning when they walked in,

359
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,559
some days are better than other days.

360
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,559
And the reality is that if you go through life,

361
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,559
the season of life,

362
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,559
you'll find that there are some days

363
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,559
that your feelings might be really on the high end.

364
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,559
You're up on the mountaintop, so to speak,

365
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,559
but then you go through that valley,

366
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,559
and all of a sudden those feelings are different.

367
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,559
And we find that God gives us assurance,

368
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,559
God gives us peace,

369
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,559
and I'm thankful that I count that as being a blessing.

370
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,559
Notice what he says in our text of Scripture.

371
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,559
In verse 19, he says that

372
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,559
we shall assure our hearts before him.

373
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,559
It says this, if our heart condemn us.

374
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,559
Let me ask this question, do not answer out loud,

375
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,559
but why would our heart condemn us?

376
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,559
Think about the greater context in what we've dealt with

377
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,559
here with the loving of the brethren.

378
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,559
And he said this in chapter number three,

379
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,559
in verse number 16,

380
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,559
hereby perceive we the love of God,

381
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,559
because he laid down his life for us,

382
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,559
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

383
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,559
But whoso hath the world's good,

384
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,559
and seeth his brother have need,

385
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,559
and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,

386
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,559
how dwelleth the love of God in him?

387
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,559
My little children,

388
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,559
let us not love in word, neither in tongue,

389
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,559
but in deed and in truth.

390
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,559
The reality is that there are times

391
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,559
in which perhaps our heart can condemn us

392
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,559
because of a situation, a circumstance.

393
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,559
We feel like, man, I should have done more,

394
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,559
or maybe we can feel that condemning heart.

395
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,559
Maybe it's the truth of what we find

396
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,559
in the book of Revelation in chapter number 12,

397
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,559
the fact that we have the accuser of the brethren,

398
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,559
the enemy.

399
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,559
He's the accuser of the brethren,

400
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,559
and he can accuse us, and he can accuse us,

401
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,559
and it can cause us to have this condemning heart

402
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,559
that he speaks of in verse number 20.

403
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,559
But I want you to notice the wonderful principle

404
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
that he gives us here.

405
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,559
He says this in verse number 20,

406
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
if our heart condemn us,

407
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,559
God is greater than our heart,

408
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,559
and knoweth all things.

409
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,559
Really, I look at this as being a principle of appealing

410
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,559
the idea of going to the greater authority.

411
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,559
When your feelings aren't what they were,

412
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,559
trust in the written word of God.

413
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,559
Because sometimes our feelings

414
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,559
are just lousy.

415
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,559
We've been dealt a tough hand,

416
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,559
a difficult situation.

417
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,559
We've missed an opportunity.

418
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,559
As I've said over the years,

419
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,559
many times an opportunity is easier

420
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,559
seeing leaving than coming.

421
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
Someone said this, I believe.

422
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
Ronnie and I talked about this.

423
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
It was in the devotional book

424
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
that you have to seize the opportunity

425
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,559
in the lifetime of the opportunity.

426
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
And the reality this morning is that

427
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
this blessing of assurance,

428
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
he says, listen, if your heart condemn us,

429
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
God is greater.

430
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,559
Go to the higher authority.

431
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,559
He knoweth all things.

432
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,559
We can rejoice in that.

433
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,559
He says this in verse 21,

434
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,559
if our heart condemn us not,

435
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,559
then have we confidence toward God.

436
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,559
You know, this morning I believe

437
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,559
that God wants us to have confidence

438
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,559
in knowing that we're His child.

439
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
He wants us to know.

440
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
He starts in verse 19 by saying

441
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
hereby and hereby we know

442
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,559
that we are of the truth.

443
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,559
How many times already in the book of 1 John

444
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
has He talked about knowing

445
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
that we're His children,

446
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,559
that we belong to Him,

447
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
that we are His and He is ours,

448
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,559
that we are adopted in the family of God.

449
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,559
What a blessing to know,

450
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,559
to have confidence.

451
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,559
And when we have that knowledge,

452
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,559
when we have that confidence,

453
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,559
it really changes our approach to God.

454
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
Think about your children.

455
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
You wanted them to know

456
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,559
that they were your children, didn't you?

457
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,559
You wanted them to know that they belonged to you.

458
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,559
That you were their parents

459
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,559
and that they had a refuge

460
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,559
in coming to you.

461
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
God wants us to know.

462
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,559
He wants us to have that assurance.

463
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,559
He wants us to have that confidence.

464
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
And when we understand the blessing of assurance,

465
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
we find that it leads us

466
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
in having this confidence that He speaks of

467
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,559
in verse number 21.

468
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
It's interesting the transition

469
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
that goes from having this assurance

470
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,559
and dealing with the thought

471
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,559
of the love for the brethren

472
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,559
to prayer in verse number 22.

473
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,559
The blessing number two,

474
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,559
if you're taking notes, of answered prayer.

475
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,959
Aren't you thankful this morning that we have a God who hears and answers prayer?

476
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:09,639
What a joy to know that He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

477
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:15,079
What joy it was for Jeremiah to hear the Lord say to him, call unto me and I will answer

478
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,679
thee and show thee great and mighty things.

479
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,559
We find that here as we look at the life of Jeremiah and you study the book of Lamentations,

480
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,439
you'll find that he indeed called out to God and God in fact worked in a marvelous way.

481
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,919
We find that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

482
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,639
The transition is made to verse number 22 of speaking of the subject of prayer and we

483
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,719
can rejoice in knowing that our God answers prayer.

484
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,399
Listen, we are to pray with confidence.

485
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,799
Why?

486
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,359
Because He's our Father.

487
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,519
Because He's extended to us an invitation to come before His throne and to come how

488
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,839
boldly according to Hebrews chapter number 4.

489
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,479
We come with boldness, why?

490
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:05,439
Because we have confidence that He's our Father and I'm His child and I can enter into His

491
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:14,619
very presence and I can bring my petitions before the throne room of heaven with confidence.

492
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:15,979
We pray in confidence.

493
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:20,019
We pray believing that God is able.

494
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:27,040
Now notice in verse number 22, we yes, enjoy the fact of knowing that our God hears and

495
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,019
answers prayer, the truth of asking and receiving.

496
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,699
Notice what he says, and whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him.

497
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:37,819
Do you notice that there's a comma and not a period?

498
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,979
The Bible continues in verse number 22 and says this, why?

499
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:48,019
Because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

500
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,839
You think about this walk of obedience again, the blessings of obedience, the blessing of

501
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,680
answered prayer, and we understand this morning that as we go to God in prayer and understanding

502
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,519
that we're walking in obedience to His word and to His way that we have this assurance,

503
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,020
we have this confidence that whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him.

504
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,520
Now, it's important that we understand that the book of Psalms in the Old Testament says

505
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,660
this in Psalm 66 and verse number 18, if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will

506
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,739
not hear me.

507
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:26,940
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

508
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,220
So we look at this principle of answered prayer, the blessing of answered prayer, and we see

509
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,380
the connection here in verse number 22 of living a life of obedience.

510
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,779
Some would look at a verse of Scripture such as this and say, well, I've asked God for

511
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:45,099
a million dollars and therefore God's going to give it to me.

512
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,539
We must compare Scripture with Scripture.

513
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,479
We must ask according to His will.

514
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:56,300
By the way, if we're walking in His commandments, as it says, because we keep His commandments

515
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,779
and do those things that are pleasing in His sight, it will impact how we pray.

516
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,619
Think about the truth of Luke chapter number 11.

517
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,739
In fact, turn over there, if you will.

518
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:12,899
In Luke chapter number 11, the passage of Scripture is so powerful as we find the model

519
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:18,619
prayer that is given as the Lord Jesus Christ answers the disciples, and of all the things

520
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:23,279
that the disciples could have asked Jesus to teach them, we find recorded in the Word

521
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,220
of God is that the disciples, really a single disciple, here in verse number 1 of chapter

522
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,139
11 says, Lord, teach us to pray.

523
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:37,739
Teach us to pray.

524
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:38,819
You'll notice the model.

525
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:44,739
We will not take an extended period of time to look through each detail, but you'll find

526
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:52,899
that it begins by saying, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

527
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,459
He's holy.

528
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,699
He reigns.

529
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,179
He rules.

530
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,580
We find it says, Thy kingdom come.

531
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,699
Notice this, Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.

532
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:11,039
We pray according to His will.

533
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:18,019
We pray believing that He hears us, understanding the truth of asking and receiving and praying

534
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:22,739
according to His will, and we find here in Luke chapter 11 that when Jesus begins to

535
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:28,380
teach the disciples to give this model prayer, He says you begin by saying, Our Father, which

536
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,859
art in heaven, understanding His place, understanding He's holy, understanding that His will is

537
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:37,260
to be accomplished.

538
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,980
It's interesting to me as we understand the truth of praying according to His will, and

539
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:49,059
we understand that the disciples in the book of Acts, as they're facing the beginning days

540
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:55,339
of persecution, and as they're facing the threats of the religious leaders, and they're

541
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:00,540
commanded that they're to no longer preach or teach in the name of Jesus, we find that

542
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:09,100
it's in Acts chapter 4 that after John and Peter were beaten and released, that the Bible

543
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,579
tells us that they report to the brethren, and they lift up their voice in Acts 4 and

544
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:21,660
verse 24, and they begin to pray, and it's interesting to me, it's convicting to me in

545
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,380
Acts chapter 4 as I read the prayer of the disciples because they begin by praying, Lord,

546
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,579
thou art God.

547
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:39,260
Oh man, if we start there and understanding who He is, this morning as I knelt here and

548
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:49,540
prayed, as I pray in my life, I begin always by just rejoicing in who He is, recalling

549
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,700
to mind the attributes of my God, the position of who He is, and understanding His holiness,

550
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,779
and it helps me in my prayer time.

551
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:09,980
If I were there in Acts 4, probably part of my prayer would have been something about

552
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,100
delivering us from these men.

553
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,179
You've heard their threats, you've heard what they've said, deliver us, I mean, God, You

554
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:25,299
can deal with them, and He can, but that's not what they prayed.

555
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:34,579
They prayed, notice if you skip down in verse number 29 of Acts 4, and now, Lord, behold

556
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:44,019
their threatenings, and grant unto Thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy

557
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,220
word.

558
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,260
What a prayer.

559
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:54,700
I believe a prayer that's according to the will of God, and in the face of great difficulty,

560
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,739
in the face of great adversity, in the threats of the religious leaders, they prayed, God,

561
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:04,480
give us boldness to speak Thy word.

562
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,579
Let me reference Psalm 37, if you will, this idea of the blessing of answered prayer.

563
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm so thankful that our God hears and answers prayer.

564
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,339
I'm so thankful this morning that we are instructed in understanding the importance of asking

565
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,940
according to His will.

566
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,179
We find that here in Psalm 37, a psalm that's attributed to David, that the Bible begins

567
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,220
by saying this in verse number one, fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou

568
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,419
envious against the workers of iniquity, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass

569
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,779
and wither as the green herb.

570
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:45,940
Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be

571
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
fed.

572
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,059
In verse number four, delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires

573
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,059
of thine heart.

574
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,739
Verse five, commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to

575
00:27:58,739 --> 00:27:59,980
pass.

576
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,220
So often I've heard people take Psalm 37 completely out of context.

577
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,419
In fact, specifically the end of verse number four, they'll say something like this, well,

578
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:16,579
you know, God said that He'll give me the desires of mine heart.

579
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:20,660
That's truly only part of what God said.

580
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:28,100
He said, delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine

581
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
heart.

582
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,059
Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.

583
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:38,260
You know what I found in my life?

584
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:45,140
As I delight myself in the Lord, His desires become my desires.

585
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,059
And as His desires become my desires, then all of a sudden verse number four has a whole

586
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,659
new light and meaning to it.

587
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,380
Because the desires that He's bringing to pass, He shall give thee the desires of thine

588
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
heart.

589
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,979
That's because my desires are His desires because I've delighted myself in the Lord.

590
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:10,940
Listen, if you begin to pray that God would use you to lead someone to Christ, if you

591
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,979
begin to pray that God would use you to be that light that He's called you to be, those

592
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:18,380
are prayers that God delights in answering.

593
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Why?

594
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,659
Because it's His will that none should perish.

595
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,619
He's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

596
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:31,700
And we find that as we study the Word of God and we understand the truth of delighting

597
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:37,219
ourselves in the Lord and how His desires will become our desires, and all of a sudden

598
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:40,820
our prayer life will change.

599
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,299
It will have a radical impact on our prayer lives when we're delighting ourselves in the

600
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:47,299
Lord.

601
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,940
You know, the reality contextually back in 1 John chapter number three, loving the brethren

602
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,940
also has a radical impact on our prayer lives.

603
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Why?

604
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,580
Because all of a sudden I'm engaged in intercessory prayer a whole lot more.

605
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,540
more than I'm engaged in praying for myself, because I'm loving the brethren as I ought

606
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:12,480
to, following the commandment, obeying the commandment that God has given.

607
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,180
What a joy to know the truth of answered prayer.

608
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:24,460
Some have said this, that God always says yes.

609
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,340
I don't find that to be true biblically.

610
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:38,420
The apostle Paul asked God to deliver him three times, according to 2 Corinthians 12.

611
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:46,320
And God's answer to Paul was, my grace is sufficient for thee.

612
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,980
Let me clarify this morning, I believe with all of my heart that God could have delivered

613
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,500
Paul from that thorn in the flesh.

614
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,860
No problem for God, amen, you believe that this morning?

615
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:09,640
God easily could have taken care of that thorn in the flesh, but we find that God said, Paul,

616
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,240
my grace is sufficient for thee.

617
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,820
And Paul's response was not that of a poochy lip and a sad countenance and woe is me and

618
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,460
I have to deal with this, no, he said I'll glory in these infirmities, why?

619
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,540
Because when I'm weak, then I'm strong, because his strength is made perfect in weakness.

620
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,780
Wow, what a perspective.

621
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,060
See God knows best, God knows best.

622
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,340
And when we look at this text of Scripture and consider these blessings, I'm so thankful

623
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:54,220
for the assurance that God gives, that confidence that we have, that assured heart of knowing

624
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,060
that we belong to Him.

625
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,900
I am His and He is mine, as the songwriter said.

626
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,020
I'm so thankful for the blessing of answered prayer.

627
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:10,200
I see directly how it's connected to obedience, to walking in a manner that is pleasing.

628
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,480
He says, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

629
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,240
Notice as we continue through the text of Scripture this morning in verse number 24,

630
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,440
I see number three, the blessing of His abiding presence.

631
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,040
Notice the Bible says, and He that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in Him and He in

632
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Him.

633
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,800
And then we see this word hereby again, by this and hereby, we know that He abideth in

634
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
us.

635
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
How?

636
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,680
By the Spirit which He hath given us.

637
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,440
The blessing of His abiding presence.

638
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
What a joy.

639
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,840
We often refer to Hebrews in the 13th chapter as we rejoice in the promises of God when

640
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,020
we say that He'll never leave us nor forsake us.

641
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,840
And how joyful we ought to be in understanding that great precious truth of God's Word.

642
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,920
This morning we find specifically that John is referring here in the inspiration of the

643
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,880
Holy Spirit of God about the dwelling in Him and He in Him.

644
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
He talks about abiding.

645
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,320
We understand that John, again, in the Gospel of John, it's interesting the connections

646
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,460
as we've made note of as we've studied the book of 1 John, specifically in the message

647
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
this morning.

648
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,800
If you read chapters 14 through 17, you'll see so much of what Jesus had spoken to the

649
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,360
disciples that John heard with His very ears is really what's being given to us in this

650
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,640
passage of Scripture.

651
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,760
And we find that it was in John 15 where Jesus said, abide in Me, and I in you, right?

652
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,320
He gives us that great truth of the vine and the branches.

653
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,720
He says, I am the vine, Jesus says, but you're the branches and the branches must abide in

654
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,120
the vine, for without Me you can do nothing.

655
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,560
And we understand that He speaks in those same passages of Scripture in John 14, 15,

656
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,720
16, and 17, and really in 15 and 16 He's speaking about the Holy Spirit of God.

657
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,160
He says it's expedient for you that I go away, why?

658
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,320
Because I'm going to send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit.

659
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,200
And as we find here in verse number 24, it says that we, and hereby we know that He abideth

660
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
in us.

661
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Why?

662
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,960
Because He abideth, verse number 24, by the Spirit which He hath given us.

663
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,920
I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit of God.

664
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,140
I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit indwells the believer.

665
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,480
You think about the truth of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God, and you understand

666
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,640
as we, the moment of salvation, the Bible tells us that we are given the earnest of

667
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:53,080
our salvation, the proof of our conversion as the Holy Spirit of God takes up residence.

668
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,720
Paul says it this way to the believers in Corinth, he says, what, know ye not that your

669
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,920
body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God?

670
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,040
Oh, I am so thankful that at the moment of salvation, I didn't understand all of this

671
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,760
when I got saved.

672
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,000
The very moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit of God took up residence.

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,680
I was indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God.

674
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,240
He is the earnest of our salvation.

675
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:26,680
There's a distinction in the Word of God between indwelling and filling, indwelling

676
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
and filling.

677
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,080
You see, sometimes, though I'm indwelled with the Spirit of God, it is possible that we

678
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,560
would not be filled with the Spirit of God because we're filled with self.

679
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,400
We need to be emptied of self.

680
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,680
Be not drunk with wine where it is in excess, in Ephesians 5 and verse number 18, but be

681
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,960
filled with the Holy Ghost.

682
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,200
The verbiage that is used there is the idea of a continual process.

683
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,320
Paul says it this way, that we're to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the

684
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,640
lust of the flesh.

685
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,160
In this blessing of His abiding presence to know that He's given us the Spirit of God,

686
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,080
the Holy Spirit, He is God.

687
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,360
We had a conversation last night after devotions, Breonna said, Daddy, if there was a verse

688
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,320
that you'd give me to prove that the Holy Spirit is God, what would it be?

689
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
And I gave her a verse.

690
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
And she's like, yeah, I like that.

691
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
It's good.

692
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,160
You go to the book of Acts and you see how that Ananias is lying.

693
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,840
And Peter says, in the book of Acts, he says to Ananias, he says, hey, listen, Satan hath

694
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,640
filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost in verse number 3.

695
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,880
And then just another conversation takes place and in verse number 4 he says, thou hast not

696
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,920
lied unto men, but unto God.

697
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,640
I have no problem with that verse of Scripture.

698
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Why?

699
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,360
Because the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, is God, and He gave us the Holy Spirit.

700
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,400
There's many other verses of Scripture that you could go to, but I love Acts 4.

701
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,440
In fact, or Acts 5, excuse me.

702
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,920
In fact, I've sat with people and I've said, hey, listen, you don't believe this, but would

703
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,720
you just read these verses and help me understand this?

704
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
And they just get all kinds of confused.

705
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,520
And I said, that's because your presupposition is that He's not God.

706
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:25,040
But the Bible clearly teaches that He is God.

707
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,520
And we are indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God.

708
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,440
Notice in the book of Romans, if you will, we'll finish with this passage of Scripture

709
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,760
in Romans chapter number 8.

710
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,800
In Romans chapter number 8 this morning, John is saying to the believers that he's writing

711
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,800
to here in 1 John, he's saying, listen, we can rejoice that as a result of obedience

712
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,840
to the Word of God, to the commandment of God, the commandments that He's given us,

713
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,360
the blessing of assurance, the blessing of answered prayer, the blessing of His abiding

714
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
presence.

715
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Notice in Romans 8 and verse number 9, the Bible says this, but you're not in the flesh,

716
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,820
but in the Spirit.

717
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,400
If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

718
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
Well, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.

719
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,440
Well that's pretty clear, is it not?

720
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,360
At the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit of God indwells the believer.

721
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,400
And then skip down, if you will, to verse number 14.

722
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,800
The Bible says, for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

723
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,280
For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit

724
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,239
of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

725
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:41,200
Notice this truth in verse number 16, the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit

726
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,480
that we are the children of God.

727
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,000
The truth of verse number 24 is directly linked to the truth of verses 19 through 21 in 1

728
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
John chapter number 3.

729
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,520
The truth of His abiding presence is what leads us to that great assurance that we have,

730
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,880
that we understand that He says here in verse number 16 that the Spirit itself beareth witness

731
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,280
with our spirit that we are the children of God.

732
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,040
Understand this morning that you can grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

733
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,640
You can quench the Holy Spirit of God.

734
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,520
And when you grieve and quench the Holy Spirit of God, you understand that it's not that

735
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,679
you lose your salvation, it's not that the Holy Spirit of God leaves you.

736
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,299
It's that He's grieved and He's quenched.

737
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:33,260
And we get right with God, and all of a sudden, no longer do we have that condemning heart.

738
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,220
We go back to the Word of God, to the authority of God's Word, to 1 John chapter number 1,

739
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,020
that if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us, to cleanse us from

740
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,660
all unrighteousness, and we have that restored fellowship once again.

741
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,739
What a joy.

742
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:53,119
The blessings of obedience.

743
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,239
This morning as we look at this passage of Scripture in 1 John chapter number 3 and really

744
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,280
finish up the third chapter this morning.

745
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,920
We find that God gives us these blessings.

746
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,800
He records for us.

747
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,440
But I wonder this morning as we look at these blessings and we look at the truth of that

748
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:19,360
assurance, that answered prayer, His abiding presence, I wonder this morning as we would

749
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:28,640
evaluate our own lives, we'd ask ourselves, how are we doing in the area of obedience?

750
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Because the blessing is the result of obedience.

751
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,580
We find that He says that we keep His commandments, that we do those things that are pleasing

752
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,880
in His sight.

753
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,040
As I mentioned in Sunday school this morning, as we've mentioned in a variety of settings

754
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,440
as we've studied through the book of 1 John, the idea is not for each of us to examine

755
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,240
someone else's life and say, hey, how are you doing obeying His commandments?

756
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,360
How are you doing pleasing Him with your life?

757
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:07,360
But it's that we would take that time to let a man examine himself, say, God, how am I

758
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,740
doing in this area of obedience?

759
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:21,000
How am I doing in living my life in such a way that it's pleasing in Your sight?

760
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Not pleasing in someone else's sight, not pleasing in my spouse's sight, not pleasing

761
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,680
in my parents' sight, not even pleasing in the pastor's sight, but pleasing in the sight

762
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
of God.

763
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,280
And we begin to evaluate our own lives.

764
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
I'm thankful for the blessings.

765
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,980
I want the blessings, but the blessings are the result of obedience.

766
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,280
You know, the reality is I found this in my life, not only personally but as I've interacted

767
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,560
with people, as I've counseled people, so often the individual that is, I'll use the

768
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,320
term backslidden, the individual that's not walking with God, the individual that's living

769
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:06,920
a life of disobedience, you know, they don't have any assurance, they struggle.

770
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,760
You know, their prayer life is just not very good.

771
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Why?

772
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,600
Because they're not right with God, so why do they want to pray?

773
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,360
Their time in the Word of God is next to nothing.

774
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Why?

775
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,000
Because why do they want to go into the presence of God if they're not doing right?

776
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,600
You know, Moody said this, he said, this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you

777
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,720
from this book.

778
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,220
I found it to be true.

779
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:39,440
If we're not walking with God, if we're not obeying His commandments, we don't want to

780
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,220
be exposed by reading this book.

781
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,600
Our time of prayer is hindered greatly.

782
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Why?

783
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,520
Because I'm not right with God.

784
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,840
My fellowship isn't right.

785
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:57,920
So I don't have that confidence to enter boldly into His presence.

786
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,880
We find that if we're in that state, if we're in that condition, oh, we must humbly bow

787
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,600
before Him and cry out for God's mercy.

788
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,200
Aren't you so thankful that our God is merciful?

789
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,480
He is gracious.

790
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,800
The Bible says that He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

791
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,180
His compassions fail not.

792
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,860
His mercy endureth forever.

793
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:27,020
If we go to God and say, God, I'm sorry, forgive me, forgive me for my sin, cleanse me from

794
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:35,820
this unrighteousness, help me to live in obedience to Your Word, we'll begin to have that assurance,

795
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,180
begin to see our prayers answered.

796
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,820
We're more aware of His abiding presence.

797
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,100
Why?

798
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,660
Because we're walking with Him.

799
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,980
We're abiding in Him.

800
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:55,820
The joys of the Christian life, the truth of the victorious Christian life.

801
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,740
This morning, we see the blessings of obedience.

802
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,740
Let's pray together.

803
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,860
Father, we love You.

804
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,060
We thank You for loving us.

805
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,060
We thank You for the Word of God.

806
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:11,460
Lord, perhaps there's one present that's not sure of heaven, as we've studied this passage

807
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,980
of Scripture, the command that was given, verse 23, that should believe on the name

808
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,020
of the Lord Jesus Christ and love the brethren.

809
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:29,500
But perhaps there's someone that's never trusted Christ as their personal Savior.

810
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,700
They've never been born again.

811
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:36,900
They do not have assurance that if they were to die today that heaven is their home.

812
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,180
We're mindful of what Jesus said in John 3, you must be born again.

813
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,060
God, if there's one in that condition, would You help them today to see their need for

814
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,060
Christ?

815
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,180
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness,

816
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,140
of judgment to come.

817
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,140
They'd get it settled.

818
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,700
Lord, I pray for the people of God, those that have been born again, those that know

819
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
You as their personal Lord and Savior.

820
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,500
God, I pray that You'd help us to walk in obedience.

821
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,740
Help us to evaluate our lives honestly before You, that we'd say, as the psalmist said,

822
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,540
search me, O God, know me.

823
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,020
God, that we would live lives that are pleasing in Your sight.

824
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:26,540
O Holy Spirit of God, if there's an area in our lives where we're not living right, we're

825
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,820
not walking in obedience to Your commands, would You please, God, expose that and help

826
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,140
us this morning to get it right?

827
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,140
The songwriter said, nothing between my soul and my Savior.

828
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:48,340
Oh, that we'd be in that place in our lives, that we'd have that sweet fellowship with

829
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,340
You.

830
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,820
We're thankful for the relationship, knowing that You're our Father and we're Your children.

831
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,580
But, oh, how we long for that sweet fellowship.

832
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,740
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments as only You can, and we'll thank You for it.

833
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,860
In Christ's name we pray.

834
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,900
Would you stand with me?
