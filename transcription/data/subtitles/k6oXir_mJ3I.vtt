00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.279
Morning, 1 John chapter number three,

00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:03.039
be looking at verses 19 through 24.

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.280
Really, the thought is continued

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.699
from our study two weeks ago.

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:09.319
Last week was Father's Day,

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.800
we're in the book of Jeremiah and the book of Ezekiel.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.880
But two weeks ago, we looked at 1 John 3,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.440
verses 11 through 18, and we used as our title

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.659
for that message two weeks ago from verse number 18,

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.959
that we're to love in deed and in truth.

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:24.760
And we mentioned this as we studied

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.479
that portion of scripture,

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:29.760
that the thought, the truth of our loved one

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.439
for another is a thought, a truth that is revisited

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.319
by John here in this little epistle

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.799
of 1 John over and over.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.639
We find the emphasis that is placed

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:41.860
upon this subject matter,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.840
the importance of the subject matter.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.000
And as we look at verses 19 through 24,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.159
and really finish up chapter number three this morning,

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.319
we find that God again continues to give us this truth

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.439
with regard to loving the brethren.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.319
And as we look at the text of scripture,

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.400
notice if you will, in verse number 19,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.880
the Bible says this,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.080
and hereby we know that we are of the truth

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.279
and shall assure our hearts before him.

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:10.680
For if our heart condemn us,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.519
God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:17.199
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:20.000
then have we confidence toward God.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.639
because we keep his commandments

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.760
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.959
And this is his commandment,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.239
that we should believe on the name of his son, Jesus Christ,

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:36.400
and love one another as he gave us commandment.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.199
And he that keepeth his commandments

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:42.080
dwelleth in him and he in him.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.120
And hereby we know that he abideth in us

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.199
by the spirit which he hath given us.

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.720
What a powerful passage of scripture,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.300
these few verses to end 1 John chapter number three.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.120
I've titled the message this morning,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.519
The Blessings of Obedience.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.040
As you read the word of God, as you study the scriptures,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760
you will find that there is a principle,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.480
you'll discover the principle over and over

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.000
throughout the scriptures that God blesses obedience.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.639
And you'll find that principle established

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.160
throughout the word of God.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.600
You'll find specifically where we find Moses

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.399
standing before the children of Israel

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.520
just before they would enter into the land of promise.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.320
And he says, I set before you today

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.520
a blessing and a curse.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.419
And we find that God blesses obedience,

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.619
but we also find on the other hand,

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.360
that disobedience will lead to judgment and cursing.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.720
We find as you study the word of God,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.440
as you study in the Old Testament specifically

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.520
with the nation of Israel, unfortunately far too often,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.119
you will find that blessings are forfeited.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.960
Why?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.919
Because of disobedience.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.279
The blessings that God desired

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.199
to pour out upon His people.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.800
I was reading this morning

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.360
and let me just share with you this truth from Psalm 81.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.619
The Bible tells us that God was working on their behalf,

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.600
that they called and troubled

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.479
and I delivered thee in verse number seven.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.500
I answered thee in the secret place of thunder.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.000
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah, Sila.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.080
But I want you to notice what God says in verse 10.

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.880
He says, I am the Lord thy God,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.679
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.039
Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it,

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:34.039
but my people would not hearken to my voice.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.160
And Israel would none of me.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Isn't that a sad verse of Scripture

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.039
in Psalm 81 in verse number 11.

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.360
So here's the consequence.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.899
It says, so I gave them up unto their own hearts lust

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.320
and they walked in their own councils.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.679
Notice the heart of God in verse 13.

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.839
Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.039
and Israel had walked in my ways.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.100
That's obedience, correct?

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.600
Notice what God says would have happened in verse number 14.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.919
I should soon have subdued their enemies

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.039
and turn my hand against their adversaries.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.399
The Bible tells us in Psalm 78

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.940
that the people of God limited the Holy One of Israel.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.980
We find that throughout the Scriptures,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.359
unfortunately, many times the blessings of God

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.220
are forfeited due to disobedience.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.500
God has graciously given us the Word of God,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.859
the precious Bible,

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:32.380
and as we hold the book in our hands this morning,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.920
as we read and study from this precious book,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.820
we find that God has given us instruction.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.299
And as he's provided instruction for us,

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:43.859
his desire is that we would take

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:46.459
and we would hear it and learn it and do it,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.019
that we would be doers of the Word,

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:50.019
that we would obey the commands.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:54.700
The reality is that it is in our best interest to obey God.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.260
And we find that here in the text of Scripture,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.459
it's interesting as the truth is laid out for us

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:03.059
with regard to the commandment of the Lord.

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.779
In verse number 23 of our text,

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.540
it says singularly,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.820
commandment that we should believe

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.899
on the name of his Son, Jesus Christ,

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.660
and love one another as he gave us commandment.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.779
Believing on Christ and loving the brethren

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.459
are so connected that they're referenced here

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:24.320
in verse number 23 as a single commandment.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.260
It's interesting because in verse 22,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.579
in verse number 24,

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:29.880
you'll find that he uses the word plural.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.700
He uses commandments plural.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.899
And we find that in verse number 22,

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.859
notice if you will at the end of the verse,

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:40.380
it says because we keep his commandments

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.359
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.980
I have in the margin of my Bible a question.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.420
Am I?

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.260
Are we?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.260
Am I keeping his commandments?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.579
Am I doing those things that are pleasing in his sight?

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.399
If I do not know his commandments,

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.339
I cannot be doing his commandments.

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.339
If I do not know what pleases him,

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.779
I cannot be doing that which pleases him.

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.619
And so we find that it's in this book

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.179
that he reveals to us the precious truth,

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.959
the instruction to live by.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.959
And we can take the commandments,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.040
the instructions that he's provided us with,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.480
and we can know that we're living our lives

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.880
in such a way that we would be pleasing in his sight.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.880
He says in verse number 24,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.559
and he that keepeth his commandments.

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.720
And so we see that in verse 22, 23, and 24,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.200
there is reference,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.839
obvious reference to the obedient believer,

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.380
to the one that is doing the will of God.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.779
We find that in verse number 22,

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.059
excuse me, verse number 23,

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.140
as we've mentioned by way of introduction,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.440
that he says this is his commandment,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.660
the first aspect that we should believe

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.980
on the name of his son, Jesus Christ.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.140
You understand this morning,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.640
this is the will of God for mankind to be saved.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.440
We find that throughout the scriptures,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.459
we find that the Lord is not willing that any should perish,

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:04.579
but that all should come to repentance.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:08.619
We find the truth that Paul, as he stands there in Acts 17,

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.220
he says in the times of this ignorance,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.179
God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:18.140
to repent, to believe, the Bible says,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.519
on the name of his son, Jesus Christ.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:23.380
I'm so thankful for the name of Jesus.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.500
We sing the song about how wonderful his name is.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.299
Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:31.059
And when you hear the name Jesus,

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.140
there are certain thoughts

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.019
that come into your mind immediately.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.019
If you're like me, if you hear someone use

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.399
the name of our wonderful Savior in vain,

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:41.119
it grieves my spirit, it grieves my heart.

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:43.839
Why? Because that's my Savior.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.359
That's my Lord.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:46.880
That's my King.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.480
And that's my Redeemer.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.920
And we find this morning that it's his will

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.019
that mankind be saved.

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:57.760
In like manner, we find that it is his will

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.760
that his people, his children, love one another.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.600
This has been the broad theme of this section

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.880
of the third chapter of the book of 1 John.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.679
And as we've thought about this broad theme

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:14.600
and understanding the commandment of the Lord,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.339
the instruction that has been given,

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:19.899
we've referenced John 13 a number of times,

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.959
but let me remind you what Jesus would say

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.519
a couple of chapters later in John 15,

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:26.040
in verse 12, he says,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.640
this is my commandment that you love one another

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.619
as I have loved you.

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:33.239
Isn't that simple?

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.919
He says in verse 17,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:39.479
these things I command you that you love one another.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:42.679
I mean, multiple times in just a short period of time

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.520
and as it's recorded in the book of the Gospel of John,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.020
do we find that Jesus is telling his disciples

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.239
that they're to love one another.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.280
This is God's will.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.159
This is God's command.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.099
I mentioned last, two weeks ago,

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:57.359
that Peter says it this way,

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:00.659
that we're to have fervent charity one toward another.

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:02.960
We find that as we studied on Wednesday evening,

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:05.059
as we're studying through the book of Philemon,

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:08.940
that Paul mentions as he's beginning to write to Philemon,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.780
and he's not even gotten to the meat of the message,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.799
but he says to him in verse number five,

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.960
hearing of thy love and faith,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.500
which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.119
and toward all saints.

00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:26.000
And how imperative it is that we love our Lord

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.599
and that we love the brethren.

00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:31.359
We said it this way on Wednesday evening,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.380
Philemon loved the Savior and he loved the saints.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.940
And we find here in 1 John 3,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.219
in these verses of Scripture in verses 19 through 24,

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:43.359
that he's speaking about the obedience

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:45.580
that we would trust the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.500
that we would believe in verse number 23

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500
on the name of his Son Jesus Christ,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.380
accepting him as our personal Savior

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.219
and then loving the brethren.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.359
Someone said it this way,

00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:57.219
if we believe in his name,

00:09:57.219 --> 00:10:00.179
we will behave in his nature.

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.979
We're to be like Christ, are we not?

00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:04.559
We're to be like Him.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.679
And we find that as we look at the text of Scripture,

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:10.479
the connection is obvious in v. 19.

00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:11.479
The Bible says,

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:13.979
and hereby, by this,

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:16.479
by the content of what we've been dealing with,

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:20.179
and we know that He's speaking of the love for the brethren

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:22.359
in v. 10 down through v. 18,

00:10:22.359 --> 00:10:24.559
and by this, and hereby,

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.679
we know, we see that word again

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.059
in the book of 1 John,

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.059
this knowledge that God desires for us to have,

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:33.059
this confidence, this assurance,

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:34.559
and He wants us to know.

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:37.059
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro.

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:39.559
He doesn't want us to wander from day to day.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.059
He wants us to know,

00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:43.059
and He says, by this, and hereby,

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:47.559
we know that we are of the truth,

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.559
and shall assure our hearts before Him.

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:54.059
Aren't you thankful for the birthmarks,

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:56.559
the truth that God gives us,

00:10:56.559 --> 00:11:00.059
how we can know what He wants us to know.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:04.559
We can know that we are of the truth.

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.559
I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:09.559
that there are three distinct blessings

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:11.559
that are identified for us

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:13.559
in these few verses of Scripture

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:15.559
that are the result of obedience.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:16.559
You think about this.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:18.059
I find in my own life,

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:21.059
and I find in the lives of those that I interact with,

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:23.559
most people want blessings.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.559
Amen?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.559
I've actually never met anyone that said,

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.559
you know, sign me up for cursings.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.059
I want judgment.

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:31.059
I want to go through...

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:34.059
No, I've never just met anyone that has that perspective.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:37.559
People say, I want the blessings.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.559
We want the result.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:43.559
But sometimes what we struggle with is the process,

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:48.059
because the result comes through obedience.

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:50.559
We want the result,

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.559
but we must understand the process.

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:56.559
God says the blessings come

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:58.559
as a result of the obedience.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.559
Let me say this,

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:01.559
just even as we start this morning,

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:05.559
you understand that not everything that we look at in life

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:08.559
as being a blessing is really a blessing.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:11.059
Sometimes we have a skewed perspective

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.059
of what a blessing is.

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:16.559
You know, sometimes a difficulty is a blessing.

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:19.559
Not all blessings are the same shape or size.

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:20.559
Amen?

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.559
Sometimes there's a difficulty that God brings in your life,

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.559
and it's a blessing.

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:29.559
And if we're not careful, we don't look at it as a blessing.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:31.559
But sometimes there might be.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:34.559
Listen, you know, the devil offered Jesus all sorts of things

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:37.559
if he'd bow down and worship Him.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.559
He is the God of this world,

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.559
the little g God of this world.

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:44.559
And sometimes we begin to look at success in the world,

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.559
we begin to look at monetary things and say,

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:48.559
look at all these blessings.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.559
Well, we better be careful.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:51.559
I'm not saying they're not blessings,

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:54.559
but I'm simply saying we ought to be able to identify

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:56.559
the true blessings of God.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.559
What is true success?

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:01.559
What is true prosperity from the perspective of God?

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.559
It's doing the will of God.

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:07.559
And hearing at the end, well done, how good and faithful servant.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:11.559
It's living a life that counts for Jesus.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.559
And we find here in this text of Scripture, again,

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:15.559
three blessings.

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:18.559
First of all, I would say the blessing of assurance.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:21.559
In verse 19, 20, and 21,

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.559
we read about this subject, really, of assurance

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.559
and this blessing of assurance.

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:28.559
We sing the song, it's number 51 in our songbook,

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:31.559
blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:32.559
Isn't it a wonderful song?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.559
It's a wonderful hymn.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:36.559
And we find here the blessing of assurance.

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:38.559
Notice what the Bible says,

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:42.559
and hereby we know this confidence, this assurance.

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:44.559
We know that we are of the truth

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:47.559
and shall assure our hearts before him.

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:50.559
It's interesting because he begins to deal with the heart

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.559
in verse number 19, and then he deals with it

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.559
in verse 20 and 21.

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.559
Notice in verse number 20, he says,

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:57.559
if our heart condemn us,

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.559
he says in verse number 21,

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:01.559
if our heart condemn us not.

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:03.559
The reality is that there are times in which

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:06.559
we look at and understand as we live life

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.559
that there are times in which we'll experience conviction

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.559
in our lives.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:14.559
There are times in which we'll have that heart

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:17.559
that is experiencing conviction.

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:19.559
He talks about condemning,

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.559
if our heart condemn us in verse number 20,

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.559
if our heart condemn us not.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:25.559
And really, I believe that as we look at

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:27.559
the passage of scripture, what John is really getting at

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:29.559
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:32.559
is that God gives us this blessing of assurance

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.559
that we might have a confident heart,

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:37.559
not a condemning heart.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:39.559
Now let me say this,

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.559
as we understand the whole of scripture,

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:44.559
we do understand that the heart is deceitful.

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:48.559
The Bible tells us that plainly in Jeremiah chapter 17.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.559
We find that the heart is deceitful,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.559
and we also know this,

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.559
that our walk with God

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:57.559
is not solely based upon our feelings.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:00.559
There are some that would lead you to believe

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:03.559
that it's all about your feelings and how you feel,

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:06.559
but the reality is that I am so thankful this morning

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:08.559
that my salvation, my assurance,

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:11.559
is not based on my feelings day by day.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:13.559
Amen?

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.559
Someone told me this morning when they walked in,

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:17.559
some days are better than other days.

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:20.559
And the reality is that if you go through life,

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:22.559
the season of life,

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:24.559
you'll find that there are some days

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:27.559
that your feelings might be really on the high end.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:30.559
You're up on the mountaintop, so to speak,

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:32.559
but then you go through that valley,

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.559
and all of a sudden those feelings are different.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:39.559
And we find that God gives us assurance,

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:41.559
God gives us peace,

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:45.559
and I'm thankful that I count that as being a blessing.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.559
Notice what he says in our text of Scripture.

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.559
In verse 19, he says that

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:55.559
we shall assure our hearts before him.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:58.559
It says this, if our heart condemn us.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.559
Let me ask this question, do not answer out loud,

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.559
but why would our heart condemn us?

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:05.559
Think about the greater context in what we've dealt with

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:07.559
here with the loving of the brethren.

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:09.559
And he said this in chapter number three,

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:11.559
in verse number 16,

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:13.559
hereby perceive we the love of God,

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:15.559
because he laid down his life for us,

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:17.559
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:20.559
But whoso hath the world's good,

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:22.559
and seeth his brother have need,

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.559
and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:28.559
how dwelleth the love of God in him?

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.559
My little children,

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.559
let us not love in word, neither in tongue,

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:35.559
but in deed and in truth.

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.559
The reality is that there are times

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:39.559
in which perhaps our heart can condemn us

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:42.559
because of a situation, a circumstance.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:44.559
We feel like, man, I should have done more,

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:48.559
or maybe we can feel that condemning heart.

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:50.559
Maybe it's the truth of what we find

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:52.559
in the book of Revelation in chapter number 12,

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:55.559
the fact that we have the accuser of the brethren,

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:56.559
the enemy.

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.559
He's the accuser of the brethren,

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.559
and he can accuse us, and he can accuse us,

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:03.559
and it can cause us to have this condemning heart

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:05.559
that he speaks of in verse number 20.

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:08.559
But I want you to notice the wonderful principle

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.559
that he gives us here.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.559
He says this in verse number 20,

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:14.559
if our heart condemn us,

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:17.559
God is greater than our heart,

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:19.559
and knoweth all things.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:22.559
Really, I look at this as being a principle of appealing

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:27.559
the idea of going to the greater authority.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:31.559
When your feelings aren't what they were,

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.559
trust in the written word of God.

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:38.559
Because sometimes our feelings

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.559
are just lousy.

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:44.559
We've been dealt a tough hand,

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.559
a difficult situation.

00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:49.559
We've missed an opportunity.

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.559
As I've said over the years,

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:53.559
many times an opportunity is easier

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.559
seeing leaving than coming.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.559
Someone said this, I believe.

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:00.559
Ronnie and I talked about this.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.559
It was in the devotional book

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.559
that you have to seize the opportunity

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:08.559
in the lifetime of the opportunity.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.559
And the reality this morning is that

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:12.559
this blessing of assurance,

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.559
he says, listen, if your heart condemn us,

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.559
God is greater.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.559
Go to the higher authority.

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:21.559
He knoweth all things.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.559
We can rejoice in that.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:25.559
He says this in verse 21,

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:29.559
if our heart condemn us not,

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:33.559
then have we confidence toward God.

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.559
You know, this morning I believe

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.559
that God wants us to have confidence

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:40.559
in knowing that we're His child.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.559
He wants us to know.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.559
He starts in verse 19 by saying

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.559
hereby and hereby we know

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.559
that we are of the truth.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.559
How many times already in the book of 1 John

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:52.559
has He talked about knowing

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.559
that we're His children,

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:56.559
that we belong to Him,

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:58.559
that we are His and He is ours,

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:01.559
that we are adopted in the family of God.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:03.559
What a blessing to know,

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.559
to have confidence.

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:07.559
And when we have that knowledge,

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:09.559
when we have that confidence,

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:12.559
it really changes our approach to God.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.559
Think about your children.

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.559
You wanted them to know

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.559
that they were your children, didn't you?

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:21.559
You wanted them to know that they belonged to you.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:23.559
That you were their parents

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:26.559
and that they had a refuge

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:30.559
in coming to you.

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.559
God wants us to know.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:34.559
He wants us to have that assurance.

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.559
He wants us to have that confidence.

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.559
And when we understand the blessing of assurance,

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.559
we find that it leads us

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.559
in having this confidence that He speaks of

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.559
in verse number 21.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.559
It's interesting the transition

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.559
that goes from having this assurance

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:50.559
and dealing with the thought

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.559
of the love for the brethren

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:55.559
to prayer in verse number 22.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.559
The blessing number two,

00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:59.559
if you're taking notes, of answered prayer.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:04.959
Aren't you thankful this morning that we have a God who hears and answers prayer?

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:09.639
What a joy to know that He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:15.079
What joy it was for Jeremiah to hear the Lord say to him, call unto me and I will answer

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:18.679
thee and show thee great and mighty things.

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:23.559
We find that here as we look at the life of Jeremiah and you study the book of Lamentations,

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:30.439
you'll find that he indeed called out to God and God in fact worked in a marvelous way.

00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:33.919
We find that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:38.639
The transition is made to verse number 22 of speaking of the subject of prayer and we

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:41.719
can rejoice in knowing that our God answers prayer.

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:44.399
Listen, we are to pray with confidence.

00:20:44.399 --> 00:20:45.799
Why?

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:48.359
Because He's our Father.

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:53.519
Because He's extended to us an invitation to come before His throne and to come how

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:57.839
boldly according to Hebrews chapter number 4.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.479
We come with boldness, why?

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:05.439
Because we have confidence that He's our Father and I'm His child and I can enter into His

00:21:05.439 --> 00:21:14.619
very presence and I can bring my petitions before the throne room of heaven with confidence.

00:21:14.619 --> 00:21:15.979
We pray in confidence.

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:20.019
We pray believing that God is able.

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:27.040
Now notice in verse number 22, we yes, enjoy the fact of knowing that our God hears and

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.019
answers prayer, the truth of asking and receiving.

00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:34.699
Notice what he says, and whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him.

00:21:34.699 --> 00:21:37.819
Do you notice that there's a comma and not a period?

00:21:37.819 --> 00:21:41.979
The Bible continues in verse number 22 and says this, why?

00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:48.019
Because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:52.839
You think about this walk of obedience again, the blessings of obedience, the blessing of

00:21:52.839 --> 00:21:58.680
answered prayer, and we understand this morning that as we go to God in prayer and understanding

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:05.519
that we're walking in obedience to His word and to His way that we have this assurance,

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:10.020
we have this confidence that whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him.

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:14.520
Now, it's important that we understand that the book of Psalms in the Old Testament says

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.660
this in Psalm 66 and verse number 18, if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.739
not hear me.

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:26.940
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:32.220
So we look at this principle of answered prayer, the blessing of answered prayer, and we see

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.380
the connection here in verse number 22 of living a life of obedience.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.779
Some would look at a verse of Scripture such as this and say, well, I've asked God for

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:45.099
a million dollars and therefore God's going to give it to me.

00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:48.539
We must compare Scripture with Scripture.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.479
We must ask according to His will.

00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:56.300
By the way, if we're walking in His commandments, as it says, because we keep His commandments

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:02.779
and do those things that are pleasing in His sight, it will impact how we pray.

00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:05.619
Think about the truth of Luke chapter number 11.

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:07.739
In fact, turn over there, if you will.

00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:12.899
In Luke chapter number 11, the passage of Scripture is so powerful as we find the model

00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:18.619
prayer that is given as the Lord Jesus Christ answers the disciples, and of all the things

00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:23.279
that the disciples could have asked Jesus to teach them, we find recorded in the Word

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:28.220
of God is that the disciples, really a single disciple, here in verse number 1 of chapter

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:35.139
11 says, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:37.739
Teach us to pray.

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:38.819
You'll notice the model.

00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:44.739
We will not take an extended period of time to look through each detail, but you'll find

00:23:44.739 --> 00:23:52.899
that it begins by saying, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:55.459
He's holy.

00:23:55.459 --> 00:23:56.699
He reigns.

00:23:56.699 --> 00:23:59.179
He rules.

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:01.580
We find it says, Thy kingdom come.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:08.699
Notice this, Thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.

00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:11.039
We pray according to His will.

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:18.019
We pray believing that He hears us, understanding the truth of asking and receiving and praying

00:24:18.019 --> 00:24:22.739
according to His will, and we find here in Luke chapter 11 that when Jesus begins to

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:28.380
teach the disciples to give this model prayer, He says you begin by saying, Our Father, which

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:34.859
art in heaven, understanding His place, understanding He's holy, understanding that His will is

00:24:34.859 --> 00:24:37.260
to be accomplished.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.980
It's interesting to me as we understand the truth of praying according to His will, and

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:49.059
we understand that the disciples in the book of Acts, as they're facing the beginning days

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:55.339
of persecution, and as they're facing the threats of the religious leaders, and they're

00:24:55.339 --> 00:25:00.540
commanded that they're to no longer preach or teach in the name of Jesus, we find that

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:09.100
it's in Acts chapter 4 that after John and Peter were beaten and released, that the Bible

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.579
tells us that they report to the brethren, and they lift up their voice in Acts 4 and

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:21.660
verse 24, and they begin to pray, and it's interesting to me, it's convicting to me in

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:28.380
Acts chapter 4 as I read the prayer of the disciples because they begin by praying, Lord,

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.579
thou art God.

00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:39.260
Oh man, if we start there and understanding who He is, this morning as I knelt here and

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:49.540
prayed, as I pray in my life, I begin always by just rejoicing in who He is, recalling

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:56.700
to mind the attributes of my God, the position of who He is, and understanding His holiness,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.779
and it helps me in my prayer time.

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:09.980
If I were there in Acts 4, probably part of my prayer would have been something about

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.100
delivering us from these men.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.179
You've heard their threats, you've heard what they've said, deliver us, I mean, God, You

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:25.299
can deal with them, and He can, but that's not what they prayed.

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:34.579
They prayed, notice if you skip down in verse number 29 of Acts 4, and now, Lord, behold

00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:44.019
their threatenings, and grant unto Thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.220
word.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.260
What a prayer.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:54.700
I believe a prayer that's according to the will of God, and in the face of great difficulty,

00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:00.739
in the face of great adversity, in the threats of the religious leaders, they prayed, God,

00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:04.480
give us boldness to speak Thy word.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:11.579
Let me reference Psalm 37, if you will, this idea of the blessing of answered prayer.

00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:14.380
I'm so thankful that our God hears and answers prayer.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:20.339
I'm so thankful this morning that we are instructed in understanding the importance of asking

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:21.940
according to His will.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.179
We find that here in Psalm 37, a psalm that's attributed to David, that the Bible begins

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:33.220
by saying this in verse number one, fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.419
envious against the workers of iniquity, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:40.779
and wither as the green herb.

00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:45.940
Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.940
fed.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:52.059
In verse number four, delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires

00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:53.059
of thine heart.

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:58.739
Verse five, commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to

00:27:58.739 --> 00:27:59.980
pass.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.220
So often I've heard people take Psalm 37 completely out of context.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.419
In fact, specifically the end of verse number four, they'll say something like this, well,

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:16.579
you know, God said that He'll give me the desires of mine heart.

00:28:16.579 --> 00:28:20.660
That's truly only part of what God said.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:28.100
He said, delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.100
heart.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:35.059
Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:38.260
You know what I found in my life?

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:45.140
As I delight myself in the Lord, His desires become my desires.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:51.059
And as His desires become my desires, then all of a sudden verse number four has a whole

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:53.659
new light and meaning to it.

00:28:53.659 --> 00:28:58.380
Because the desires that He's bringing to pass, He shall give thee the desires of thine

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.380
heart.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.979
That's because my desires are His desires because I've delighted myself in the Lord.

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:10.940
Listen, if you begin to pray that God would use you to lead someone to Christ, if you

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.979
begin to pray that God would use you to be that light that He's called you to be, those

00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:18.380
are prayers that God delights in answering.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.380
Why?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.659
Because it's His will that none should perish.

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:25.619
He's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:31.700
And we find that as we study the Word of God and we understand the truth of delighting

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:37.219
ourselves in the Lord and how His desires will become our desires, and all of a sudden

00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:40.820
our prayer life will change.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:46.299
It will have a radical impact on our prayer lives when we're delighting ourselves in the

00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:47.299
Lord.

00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:51.940
You know, the reality contextually back in 1 John chapter number three, loving the brethren

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.940
also has a radical impact on our prayer lives.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
Why?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.580
Because all of a sudden I'm engaged in intercessory prayer a whole lot more.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:05.540
more than I'm engaged in praying for myself, because I'm loving the brethren as I ought

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:12.480
to, following the commandment, obeying the commandment that God has given.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.180
What a joy to know the truth of answered prayer.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:24.460
Some have said this, that God always says yes.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.340
I don't find that to be true biblically.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:38.420
The apostle Paul asked God to deliver him three times, according to 2 Corinthians 12.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:46.320
And God's answer to Paul was, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:54.980
Let me clarify this morning, I believe with all of my heart that God could have delivered

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.500
Paul from that thorn in the flesh.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.860
No problem for God, amen, you believe that this morning?

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:09.640
God easily could have taken care of that thorn in the flesh, but we find that God said, Paul,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.240
my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:18.820
And Paul's response was not that of a poochy lip and a sad countenance and woe is me and

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.460
I have to deal with this, no, he said I'll glory in these infirmities, why?

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:30.540
Because when I'm weak, then I'm strong, because his strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.780
Wow, what a perspective.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.060
See God knows best, God knows best.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:46.340
And when we look at this text of Scripture and consider these blessings, I'm so thankful

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:54.220
for the assurance that God gives, that confidence that we have, that assured heart of knowing

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.060
that we belong to Him.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.900
I am His and He is mine, as the songwriter said.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.020
I'm so thankful for the blessing of answered prayer.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:10.200
I see directly how it's connected to obedience, to walking in a manner that is pleasing.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.480
He says, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.240
Notice as we continue through the text of Scripture this morning in verse number 24,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.440
I see number three, the blessing of His abiding presence.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.040
Notice the Bible says, and He that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in Him and He in

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040
Him.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.800
And then we see this word hereby again, by this and hereby, we know that He abideth in

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.800
us.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.800
How?

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.680
By the Spirit which He hath given us.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.440
The blessing of His abiding presence.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440
What a joy.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.840
We often refer to Hebrews in the 13th chapter as we rejoice in the promises of God when

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.020
we say that He'll never leave us nor forsake us.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:01.840
And how joyful we ought to be in understanding that great precious truth of God's Word.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.920
This morning we find specifically that John is referring here in the inspiration of the

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.880
Holy Spirit of God about the dwelling in Him and He in Him.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.760
He talks about abiding.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.320
We understand that John, again, in the Gospel of John, it's interesting the connections

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.460
as we've made note of as we've studied the book of 1 John, specifically in the message

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.460
this morning.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.800
If you read chapters 14 through 17, you'll see so much of what Jesus had spoken to the

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:34.360
disciples that John heard with His very ears is really what's being given to us in this

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.640
passage of Scripture.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.760
And we find that it was in John 15 where Jesus said, abide in Me, and I in you, right?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.320
He gives us that great truth of the vine and the branches.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.720
He says, I am the vine, Jesus says, but you're the branches and the branches must abide in

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.120
the vine, for without Me you can do nothing.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:02.560
And we understand that He speaks in those same passages of Scripture in John 14, 15,

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:08.720
16, and 17, and really in 15 and 16 He's speaking about the Holy Spirit of God.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.160
He says it's expedient for you that I go away, why?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.320
Because I'm going to send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.200
And as we find here in verse number 24, it says that we, and hereby we know that He abideth

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200
in us.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.200
Why?

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.960
Because He abideth, verse number 24, by the Spirit which He hath given us.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.920
I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit of God.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.140
I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit indwells the believer.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.480
You think about the truth of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God, and you understand

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.640
as we, the moment of salvation, the Bible tells us that we are given the earnest of

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:53.080
our salvation, the proof of our conversion as the Holy Spirit of God takes up residence.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.720
Paul says it this way to the believers in Corinth, he says, what, know ye not that your

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.920
body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God?

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.040
Oh, I am so thankful that at the moment of salvation, I didn't understand all of this

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.760
when I got saved.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.000
The very moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit of God took up residence.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.680
I was indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.240
He is the earnest of our salvation.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:26.680
There's a distinction in the Word of God between indwelling and filling, indwelling

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680
and filling.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.080
You see, sometimes, though I'm indwelled with the Spirit of God, it is possible that we

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:38.560
would not be filled with the Spirit of God because we're filled with self.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.400
We need to be emptied of self.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.680
Be not drunk with wine where it is in excess, in Ephesians 5 and verse number 18, but be

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.960
filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.200
The verbiage that is used there is the idea of a continual process.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.320
Paul says it this way, that we're to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.640
lust of the flesh.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.160
In this blessing of His abiding presence to know that He's given us the Spirit of God,

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.080
the Holy Spirit, He is God.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.360
We had a conversation last night after devotions, Breonna said, Daddy, if there was a verse

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.320
that you'd give me to prove that the Holy Spirit is God, what would it be?

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320
And I gave her a verse.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320
And she's like, yeah, I like that.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320
It's good.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:27.160
You go to the book of Acts and you see how that Ananias is lying.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:33.840
And Peter says, in the book of Acts, he says to Ananias, he says, hey, listen, Satan hath

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.640
filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost in verse number 3.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.880
And then just another conversation takes place and in verse number 4 he says, thou hast not

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.920
lied unto men, but unto God.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.640
I have no problem with that verse of Scripture.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.640
Why?

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.360
Because the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, is God, and He gave us the Holy Spirit.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.400
There's many other verses of Scripture that you could go to, but I love Acts 4.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.440
In fact, or Acts 5, excuse me.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.920
In fact, I've sat with people and I've said, hey, listen, you don't believe this, but would

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.720
you just read these verses and help me understand this?

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.160
And they just get all kinds of confused.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.520
And I said, that's because your presupposition is that He's not God.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:25.040
But the Bible clearly teaches that He is God.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.520
And we are indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.440
Notice in the book of Romans, if you will, we'll finish with this passage of Scripture

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.760
in Romans chapter number 8.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.800
In Romans chapter number 8 this morning, John is saying to the believers that he's writing

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:46.800
to here in 1 John, he's saying, listen, we can rejoice that as a result of obedience

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.840
to the Word of God, to the commandment of God, the commandments that He's given us,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.360
the blessing of assurance, the blessing of answered prayer, the blessing of His abiding

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360
presence.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.360
Notice in Romans 8 and verse number 9, the Bible says this, but you're not in the flesh,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.820
but in the Spirit.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.400
If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.880
Well, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.440
Well that's pretty clear, is it not?

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.360
At the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit of God indwells the believer.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.400
And then skip down, if you will, to verse number 14.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.800
The Bible says, for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.280
For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.239
of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:41.200
Notice this truth in verse number 16, the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.480
that we are the children of God.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:51.000
The truth of verse number 24 is directly linked to the truth of verses 19 through 21 in 1

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.400
John chapter number 3.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.520
The truth of His abiding presence is what leads us to that great assurance that we have,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.880
that we understand that He says here in verse number 16 that the Spirit itself beareth witness

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.280
with our spirit that we are the children of God.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.040
Understand this morning that you can grieve the Holy Spirit of God.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.640
You can quench the Holy Spirit of God.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.520
And when you grieve and quench the Holy Spirit of God, you understand that it's not that

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.679
you lose your salvation, it's not that the Holy Spirit of God leaves you.

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:26.299
It's that He's grieved and He's quenched.

00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:33.260
And we get right with God, and all of a sudden, no longer do we have that condemning heart.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.220
We go back to the Word of God, to the authority of God's Word, to 1 John chapter number 1,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.020
that if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us, to cleanse us from

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.660
all unrighteousness, and we have that restored fellowship once again.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.739
What a joy.

00:39:48.739 --> 00:39:53.119
The blessings of obedience.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:57.239
This morning as we look at this passage of Scripture in 1 John chapter number 3 and really

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:59.280
finish up the third chapter this morning.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.920
We find that God gives us these blessings.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.800
He records for us.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:11.440
But I wonder this morning as we look at these blessings and we look at the truth of that

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:19.360
assurance, that answered prayer, His abiding presence, I wonder this morning as we would

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:28.640
evaluate our own lives, we'd ask ourselves, how are we doing in the area of obedience?

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.640
Because the blessing is the result of obedience.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.580
We find that He says that we keep His commandments, that we do those things that are pleasing

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.880
in His sight.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:47.040
As I mentioned in Sunday school this morning, as we've mentioned in a variety of settings

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.440
as we've studied through the book of 1 John, the idea is not for each of us to examine

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.240
someone else's life and say, hey, how are you doing obeying His commandments?

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.360
How are you doing pleasing Him with your life?

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:07.360
But it's that we would take that time to let a man examine himself, say, God, how am I

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.740
doing in this area of obedience?

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:21.000
How am I doing in living my life in such a way that it's pleasing in Your sight?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.600
Not pleasing in someone else's sight, not pleasing in my spouse's sight, not pleasing

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.680
in my parents' sight, not even pleasing in the pastor's sight, but pleasing in the sight

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680
of God.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.280
And we begin to evaluate our own lives.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.640
I'm thankful for the blessings.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.980
I want the blessings, but the blessings are the result of obedience.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:47.280
You know, the reality is I found this in my life, not only personally but as I've interacted

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:54.560
with people, as I've counseled people, so often the individual that is, I'll use the

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.320
term backslidden, the individual that's not walking with God, the individual that's living

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:06.920
a life of disobedience, you know, they don't have any assurance, they struggle.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.760
You know, their prayer life is just not very good.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760
Why?

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.600
Because they're not right with God, so why do they want to pray?

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.360
Their time in the Word of God is next to nothing.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360
Why?

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.000
Because why do they want to go into the presence of God if they're not doing right?

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.600
You know, Moody said this, he said, this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.720
from this book.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.220
I found it to be true.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:39.440
If we're not walking with God, if we're not obeying His commandments, we don't want to

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.220
be exposed by reading this book.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.600
Our time of prayer is hindered greatly.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600
Why?

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.520
Because I'm not right with God.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.840
My fellowship isn't right.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:57.920
So I don't have that confidence to enter boldly into His presence.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:03.880
We find that if we're in that state, if we're in that condition, oh, we must humbly bow

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.600
before Him and cry out for God's mercy.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.200
Aren't you so thankful that our God is merciful?

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.480
He is gracious.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.800
The Bible says that He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.180
His compassions fail not.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.860
His mercy endureth forever.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:27.020
If we go to God and say, God, I'm sorry, forgive me, forgive me for my sin, cleanse me from

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:35.820
this unrighteousness, help me to live in obedience to Your Word, we'll begin to have that assurance,

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.180
begin to see our prayers answered.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.820
We're more aware of His abiding presence.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.100
Why?

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.660
Because we're walking with Him.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.980
We're abiding in Him.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:55.820
The joys of the Christian life, the truth of the victorious Christian life.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.740
This morning, we see the blessings of obedience.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.740
Let's pray together.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.860
Father, we love You.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.060
We thank You for loving us.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.060
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:11.460
Lord, perhaps there's one present that's not sure of heaven, as we've studied this passage

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:17.980
of Scripture, the command that was given, verse 23, that should believe on the name

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:24.020
of the Lord Jesus Christ and love the brethren.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:29.500
But perhaps there's someone that's never trusted Christ as their personal Savior.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.700
They've never been born again.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:36.900
They do not have assurance that if they were to die today that heaven is their home.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.180
We're mindful of what Jesus said in John 3, you must be born again.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.060
God, if there's one in that condition, would You help them today to see their need for

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.060
Christ?

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:50.180
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.140
of judgment to come.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.140
They'd get it settled.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.700
Lord, I pray for the people of God, those that have been born again, those that know

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.700
You as their personal Lord and Savior.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.500
God, I pray that You'd help us to walk in obedience.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:11.740
Help us to evaluate our lives honestly before You, that we'd say, as the psalmist said,

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.540
search me, O God, know me.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.020
God, that we would live lives that are pleasing in Your sight.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:26.540
O Holy Spirit of God, if there's an area in our lives where we're not living right, we're

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:33.820
not walking in obedience to Your commands, would You please, God, expose that and help

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.140
us this morning to get it right?

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.140
The songwriter said, nothing between my soul and my Savior.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:48.340
Oh, that we'd be in that place in our lives, that we'd have that sweet fellowship with

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.340
You.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.820
We're thankful for the relationship, knowing that You're our Father and we're Your children.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.580
But, oh, how we long for that sweet fellowship.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:01.740
I pray that You'd move and work in these moments as only You can, and we'll thank You for it.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.860
In Christ's name we pray.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.900
Would you stand with me?
