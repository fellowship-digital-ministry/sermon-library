00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
number 24 this evening, Genesis chapter number 24.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.239
And I mentioned this morning and encouraged you

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.960
if you had an opportunity to read the chapter

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.039
and someone came and said,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.260
I read Genesis 24 this afternoon, maybe more people did,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.300
but that was an encouragement to me.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.600
And I said, well, you'll be ready to go

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.559
for the message this evening, amen.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:19.920
And we're gonna make our way

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.059
through this passage of scripture.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.159
Depending on the size of the font in your Bible,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.079
Genesis 24 is two or three pages

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.680
and we're gonna make our way through it

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.080
by the grace of God.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.819
We might be here until 7.30,

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.400
but by the grace of God, we'll make our way through.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.900
I'm just teasing with you, put your seatbelt on

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.740
and we'll get through it, amen.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.439
The Bible says this in verse number one,

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:47.439
and Abraham was old and well stricken in age

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.479
and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.479
You could preach a message just from that verse

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.400
of scripture and the reality is that we have traced

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.959
the life of Abraham over many, many months now

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.819
as we've studied through the pages of the book of Genesis.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.720
And of course, as we look at the life of Abraham,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
we would agree as God testifies

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.959
that he was a man that had been blessed by God.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.879
And I'm so thankful that every good gift

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.879
and every perfect gift cometh from above, amen.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.720
And our God is so good to us

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.080
and he has blessed us with so many blessings.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.339
And Abraham is old and well stricken in age.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.139
We find through our text of scripture here

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.239
that the real key, the real idea of what's going on here,

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.819
the setting, if you will, for the passage of scripture

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.980
is the fact that Isaac needs a wife.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.379
And notice as we look at really the first 11 verses

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:47.819
by way of introduction, really what takes place here,

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.540
the Bible says that Abraham said unto his eldest servant

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.699
of his house.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:53.260
If you go back to Genesis 15,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.400
I believe that he's speaking here of Eleazar.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.559
That of course is debatable because his name is not used

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:01.800
in the particular passage of scripture.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.599
But often tonight, I will use that name.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.199
If you disagree theologically, we can talk about that later.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.339
But I based that on Genesis 15 in verse number two.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.919
It says that he ruled over all that he had.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.679
And here's what Abraham said to him.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.880
Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.399
And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:23.440
and the God of the earth,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.119
that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.520
of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.720
But thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.039
and take a wife unto my son Isaac.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.039
And so we find here in these couple of verses of scripture

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.820
that the need is identified, that Abraham reveals

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.119
to his servant the need for Isaac to have a wife.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.399
And the responsibility that is placed upon this servant,

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.119
Eliezer, is a weighty responsibility.

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.119
Can you imagine Abraham coming and saying,

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.919
here's the situation, and Isaac needs a wife,

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.600
and you're going to be the one that's going to go,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.880
and you're responsible for this.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.279
That is a weighty responsibility.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.399
We find that the servant, Eliezer, responds.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.899
There's a measure of doubt in his response,

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.759
as we find in verse number five,

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.559
that he says unto Abraham, peradventure,

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.320
the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.000
Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.580
from whence thou camest?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.960
And Abraham said unto him, beware thou

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.080
that thou bring not my son thither again.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.399
It's very interesting, Abraham says,

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.160
no, my son's not gonna go, you're going to go,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.479
and you're gonna bring the wife back to him.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.080
And then notice the faith and confidence

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.039
of Abraham in verse number seven.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.440
He says, the Lord God of heaven,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.740
which took me from my father's house

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.720
and from the land of my kindred,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.199
and which spake unto me, and that swear unto me,

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.800
saying, unto thy seed will I give this land,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.440
notice this, he shall send his angel before thee,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.399
and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.240
You know, the reality is that as we look

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.000
through this text of scripture this evening

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.160
and study the entirety of this chapter,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.800
I believe with full confidence

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.380
that the faith and confidence of Abraham,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.679
as it's revealed here in the introduction,

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:23.440
has an impact upon his servant.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.880
You know, when you believe God and you speak

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.540
with a measure of confidence about what God is able to do,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.559
you have the ability to influence and impact other people

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.640
to also have faith and confidence in God.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.920
Abraham was a man that had walked with God.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.799
Abraham was a man that had seen God provide.

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.200
He, of course, as we studied the 21st chapter

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.359
a few weeks ago as the birth of Isaac,

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.119
and he'd waited 25 years, I mean,

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.000
God had given that promise and the fulfillment

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.440
of that promise just as God said he did

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.040
what he said he would do, and Abraham here

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.380
with this measure of faith and confidence,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.380
he says that the Lord shall send his angel before thee.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.559
Notice in verse number eight,

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:09.880
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.920
then thou shalt be clear from this my oath,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.119
only bring not my son thither again.

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.160
So he says here, if she refuses,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.600
I still don't want you to take Isaac to this place.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.359
I do not want Isaac to go thither.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.839
The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham,

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.959
his master, and swore to him concerning that matter,

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.959
and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.279
and departed for all the goods of his master

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.200
were in his hand, and he arose and went to Mesopotamia

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.279
under the city of Nahor, and he made his camels

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.760
to kneel down without the city by a well of water

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.399
at the time of the evening,

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:48.760
even the time that women go out to draw water.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.799
So we see that there is an agreement

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.600
in verses nine through 11,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.519
and there is a departure by Eleazar.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.760
He takes all of those goods that are mentioned.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.760
He takes the camels and so on and so forth,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.399
and he enters to this place.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.279
I wanna draw your attention quickly to verse number 50,

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.320
give you the title, and then we'll jump right

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.100
into the message this evening.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.359
The Bible says, then Laban and Bethuel answered and said,

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:15.559
the thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.320
We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.660
As we look at this 24th chapter of the book of Genesis,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.040
I wanna preach a message that I've simply entitled,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.519
the thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.880
I'm so thankful that God has a plan, amen.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.640
I'm so thankful that God is able to bring his plan to pass,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.380
amen, and as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.320
this evening, I trust that you would be encouraged

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.200
and that you would be strengthened in understanding

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.440
that our God has a plan.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.079
He has a plan for your life, he has a plan for my life,

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:52.880
and we can rejoice greatly in knowing

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.299
that he doeth all things well.

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:58.320
Notice, if you wanna take notes this evening,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.000
number one, he, speaking of Eleazar,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.859
he requested God's favor.

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.239
In verses 12 through 14, we find that Eleazar

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.040
prays to the God of heaven.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.720
We find that he requests the favor of God.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.600
It says in verse number 12, and he said,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.959
O Lord God of my master Abraham,

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:23.000
I pray thee, send me good speed this day

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.519
and show kindness unto my master Abraham.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.839
Now, notice as we look at this prayer

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:32.040
as it's recorded in these three verses of Scripture,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.079
that his prayer was both genuine and specific.

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.880
The reality is that we need to learn,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.100
even as I mentioned this morning

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.140
about the prayer life of Epaphras,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.579
it is important that we as the people of God

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:46.940
learn to pray specifically.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:52.380
That we do not just simply pray in general terms,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.660
but we pray specifically.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.380
The reality is that Eleazar could have stopped praying

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.739
in verse number 12 and simply said,

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:01.420
send me good speed this day

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.859
and show kindness unto my master Abraham.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.260
And that could have been his prayer.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.019
And then he's left to determine,

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:10.739
did God show kindness or did God not show kindness

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:12.059
and so on and so forth.

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:14.100
But we find the genuine nature

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.660
in the specific prayer of Eleazar.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.019
It says, behold, I stand here by the well of water.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.420
The daughters of the men of the city

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.380
come out to draw water.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.059
Notice what he says in verse number 14.

00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:28.660
Notice how specific he is.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.659
And let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.940
let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,

00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.500
that I may drink and she shall say, drink.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.020
And I will give thy camels drink also.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.020
Let the same be she that thou hast appointed

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.700
for thy servant Isaac.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700
And thereby shall I know that thou has shown kindness

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.460
unto my master.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.380
I love the prayer of Eleazar.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.299
I love the specific nature of what he prays.

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:01.539
He says, I'm here by this well of water

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:05.219
and the women are going to come out for that was the time,

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.340
according to what we see in verse number 11,

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.739
it was the time of the evening,

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:11.099
even the time that women go out to draw water.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:13.099
And he says, let it come to pass.

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:15.900
He's gonna approach one of these women

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.299
that come to draw water and he's going to say,

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:20.700
let down thy pitcher that I may drink.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.219
He never met her before, has no idea who she is.

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:26.380
She has no idea who he is.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.659
He's just gonna say, let down my pitcher that I may drink.

00:09:29.659 --> 00:09:33.979
And then he says this, that she shall say, drink,

00:09:33.979 --> 00:09:38.179
and then she will say, I will give thy camels drink also.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.859
Okay, that's pretty specific, right?

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:48.340
And he said, let it be the same one

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.700
that's to be the wife of my master,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.419
of my appointed for thy servant, Isaac.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.179
And then he says this at the end of the verse,

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:00.299
at the end of verse number 14, and thereby,

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.299
shall I know that Thou hast showed kindness

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:06.799
unto my Master?"

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.919
He prayed for kindness generically,

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.379
if you will, in verse number 12,

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:12.179
but then he says, here's how I'm gonna know

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.139
that you've shown kindness,

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:16.679
because I'm asking specifically for you to do something,

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:20.219
and when you do specifically what I'm asking you to do,

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.219
I'll know that that's your hand.

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:26.059
I've not manufactured the circumstances on my own.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:29.179
I've not created the situation

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:31.839
so that I could try to have my hand in it.

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.979
No, there's nothing I can do about this.

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:35.719
There's no way I can figure out

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:40.219
which the bride is, who the bride is to be for Isaac,

00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:42.259
and God, I just need to trust you,

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.639
and I'm praying that you would work this way.

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:47.379
What a prayer.

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:54.459
We find that he requested God's favor.

00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:56.259
I will say this, if you're taking notes,

00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:59.619
in verse number two, he recognized God's provision.

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:02.579
I love that the Bible begins in verse number 15.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:07.299
It says, and it came to pass before he had done speaking.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.259
You know, there are times in which God answers

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:10.659
the prayers of his people,

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:13.339
even while we're still praying the prayer.

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:19.339
I mean, it came to pass before he had done speaking

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:22.259
that behold, Rebekah came out,

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:24.719
who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah,

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:28.039
the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:30.359
with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:33.119
And the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin,

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:34.799
neither had any man known her.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.239
And she went down to the well

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:38.699
and filled her pitcher and came up.

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.799
And the servant ran to meet her and said,

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:45.139
let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:46.999
This is exactly how he prayed, right?

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:48.759
He said, there's gonna be one that's gonna come,

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:51.799
and the one that I approach and say, let me have a drink,

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.239
and man, he's doing his part, he's gone,

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:56.019
and it says that he asked for a drink,

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:57.879
a little water of thy pitcher.

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:02.499
And she said, in verse number 18, drink, my Lord.

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:06.199
And she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:07.899
and gave him drink.

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:11.499
And when she had done giving him drink, she said,

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:14.999
I will draw water for thy camels also

00:12:14.999 --> 00:12:17.019
until they have done drinking.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:18.019
Can you imagine?

00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:20.319
I mean, I want you to put yourself

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.799
in the text of Scripture this evening

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:23.799
and put yourself in the life of Eleazar

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:25.159
and be in that situation.

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:29.479
You've just prayed super specific

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:32.219
about this responsibility that has been given to you

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:36.039
by Abraham, your master, and you've prayed specifically,

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:39.799
and it's unfolding right before your eyes.

00:12:39.799 --> 00:12:42.879
She says, drink, and he drinks, and she says,

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:45.759
I'm gonna go draw for the camels that they may drink also.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:47.679
That's exactly what he prayed.

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:53.679
We find that as he's recognizing God's provision,

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.919
that it's exactly what he prayed for.

00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:00.239
We find that in verse number 20, it says this.

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:03.879
It says, and she hasted and emptied her pitcher

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.879
into the trough and ran again under the well

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:10.239
to draw water and drew for all his camels.

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:12.739
No doubt, this was a long process.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.319
Camels drink a lot of water.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:21.279
It's a long process, a labor-intensive process.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:25.119
And I want you to see Eleazar as he's standing there

00:13:25.119 --> 00:13:28.199
in amazement in verse number 21, and it says this.

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:31.319
The man wandering at her held his peace

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:33.239
to wit whether the Lord had made

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:36.799
his journey prosperous or not.

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:39.819
Can you imagine, are there ever times that you pray

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.319
and God answers the prayer and you're just kind of like,

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:45.979
really, God answered exactly like I prayed?

00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:50.419
Like is this, yes, our God hears and answers prayer.

00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:53.039
Yes, our God answers specifically

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:56.239
to the specific requests that we make.

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:59.259
And we find that so often in our prayer lives,

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:02.879
we pray in general terms, we pray generically,

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:06.059
and therefore we fail to even be able to recognize

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:07.639
when God is answering our prayers

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.579
because we're not praying specifically,

00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:12.199
but the reality is that when we pray specifically,

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:14.879
we see God answer specific prayers.

00:14:17.239 --> 00:14:19.000
And how that encourages us

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.359
and how that increases our faith, why?

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:24.679
Because we know that God has answered the prayer.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:26.679
He said this at the end of verse number 14,

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:31.679
and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.639
unto my master.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:36.959
He was going to have this confidence, this knowledge,

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.839
because God was going to answer.

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:41.720
We find in verse number 22, it says that it came to pass

00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.239
as the camels had done drinking,

00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:47.119
that the man took a golden earring of a half a shekel weight

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:51.079
two bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels weight of gold

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:52.839
and said, whose daughter art thou?

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:56.000
Tell me, I pray thee, is there room in thy father's house

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.959
for us to lodge in?

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:59.239
And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel,

00:14:59.239 --> 00:15:02.000
the son of Milcah, which she bear unto Nahor.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.639
She said, moreover unto him,

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:08.359
we have both strong, preventer enough, and room to lodge in.

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:10.039
He requested God's favor.

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:13.319
We find that he recognizes God's provision.

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:14.959
If you're taking notes, number three,

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:18.319
he rejoiced for answered prayer.

00:15:18.319 --> 00:15:22.119
In verses 26 and 27, the response of Eleazar

00:15:22.119 --> 00:15:25.279
is a proper response to answered prayer.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.839
When God answers prayer, God's people should rejoice.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:30.039
Amen?

00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:33.399
We find that he rejoiced for answered prayer.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.519
This response is noted.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:40.119
It says in verse 26, and the man bowed down his head

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:44.399
and worshiped the Lord.

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.839
He bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord.

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:50.079
He said, God has answered my prayer.

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.679
He's rejoicing.

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:53.839
It says in verse number 27, he said,

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:57.079
blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham,

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:00.199
who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:01.239
and his truth.

00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:04.599
I, being in the way, the Lord led me

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:08.039
to the house of my master's brethren.

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:11.959
I want you to understand that as he bows his head and worships

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:14.399
that he's thanking God for answered prayer,

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.599
but he's also acknowledging at the end there

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:20.639
of verse number 27 that he had nothing to do with it.

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.239
This was the hand of God.

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:26.639
This was God answering the prayer

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.199
that Eleazar had prayed.

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:32.839
And how encouraging, and how it must

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:34.959
have strengthened his faith.

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:37.519
We know that as we continue reading and continue

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.879
to go through the message this evening,

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:42.919
that not only was his faith increased

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.919
and not only was he strengthened,

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:49.000
but because of the specific nature of the prayer

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.039
and the specific answer that God provided,

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:56.559
he is able to adequately convince others

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:59.599
of the hand of God.

00:16:59.599 --> 00:17:03.639
Now that's precious, because it's not his doing.

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:06.399
It's not him manufacturing the blessing.

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:09.519
It's not him manufacturing the circumstances.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:11.199
He's able to sit back and say,

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:13.159
let me just tell you what God did.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.679
I, being in the way, the Lord led me

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.919
to the house of my master's brethren.

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.879
He didn't know where to go, what to do, who to go.

00:17:22.879 --> 00:17:24.519
He just prayed and said,

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:26.599
God, would you make my way prosperous?

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.639
Here's what I'm gonna do.

00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:29.479
This is the best plan I can come up with.

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:32.159
I'm praying, God, that the woman that I approach

00:17:32.159 --> 00:17:34.440
and ask for a drink, that she'll say drink

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.639
and then she'll say, I'll get all thy camel's water as well.

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:40.279
Let that be the one.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:41.919
And before he was done praying,

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:44.759
woman comes.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.359
And just as he had prayed,

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:52.319
so he now is rejoicing for answered prayer.

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:54.159
You know, it's important that we thank God

00:17:54.159 --> 00:17:55.399
when he answers prayer.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.039
With prayer and thanksgiving.

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.319
With prayer and thanksgiving.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:03.879
He is to be honored, he is to be exalted.

00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:06.639
When we're able to testify to others

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:09.279
of how God has answered prayer in our lives,

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.239
you know that's impactful to people.

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.239
When you can stand and testify and say,

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.799
listen, I prayed about this.

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.279
And God answered my prayers.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:21.119
Why?

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:24.639
Because we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:29.159
Notice, in the next several verses,

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.759
we find, if you're taking notes,

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:33.760
number four, he rehearsed the events.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.320
The journey and arrival is recorded for us

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.279
in verses 28 through 33.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:40.599
The Bible says, the damsel ran and told them

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:42.359
of her mother's house, these things.

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.679
And Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban.

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.679
And Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:50.000
And it came to pass, when he saw the earring

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.519
and bracelets upon his sister's hands,

00:18:52.519 --> 00:18:54.719
when he heard the words of Rebecca, his sister,

00:18:54.719 --> 00:18:57.000
saying, thus spake the man unto me,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.760
that he came unto the man, and behold,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.320
he stood by the camels at the well.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.799
And he said, come in, thou blessed of the Lord,

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.519
wherefore standest thou without?

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:09.320
For I have prepared the house and room for the camels.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.880
And the man came into the house,

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.320
and he ungirded his camels,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.640
and gave straw and provender for the camels,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.399
and water to wash his feet,

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:18.760
and the men's feet that were with him.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.479
And there was set meat before him to eat.

00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:23.599
But notice what he says.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:27.799
I will not eat until I have told mine errand,

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.440
and he said, speak on.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.320
So now we find that Eliezer is going to rehearse the events.

00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:39.440
They've now arrived at Rebecca's home,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.760
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.919
that he said, in verse number 34,

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.599
I am Abraham's servant.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:49.640
And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.799
God had already told us that in verse number one,

00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:54.119
when he told us that Abraham was stricken in age,

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:56.839
he was old, and that the Lord had blessed Abraham

00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:58.440
in all things.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.440
And Eliezer said, the Lord hath blessed.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.280
to my master greatly.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.320
And it says this in verse 35,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.520
and he has become great,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.440
and he hath given him flocks and herds

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.920
and silver and gold and menservants

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.400
and maidservants and camels and asses.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.260
And Sarah, my master's wife,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.800
bare a son to my master when she was old,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.800
and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.720
And my master made me swear,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.340
saying, thou shalt not take a wife to my son

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.120
of the daughters of the Canaanites

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.360
in whose land I dwell,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.480
but thou shalt go into my father's house

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.120
and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.440
And I said unto my master,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.200
peradventure, the woman will not follow me.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.680
And he said unto me, the Lord,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.600
before whom I walk will send his angel with thee,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.920
and notice this, and prosper thy way.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.440
Thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.400
and of my father's house.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.840
Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.320
when thou comest to my kindred,

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.340
and if they give not thee one,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.780
thou shalt be clear from my oath.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.100
So he gives the backstory to Laban and to the household,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.760
and he says, here's why I'm here,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.600
here's the reason for my journey,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.240
and he provides this introduction and this review

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.639
with regard to who he was and why he was there,

00:21:15.639 --> 00:21:19.020
and we find that now as we come to verse number 42,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.819
he says, and I came this day unto the well,

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:24.180
and he rehearses what he prayed.

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:28.480
I said, O Lord God of my master Abraham,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.340
if now thou do prosper my way which I go,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.500
behold, I stand by the well of water,

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.740
and it shall come to pass

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.940
that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.380
and I say to her, give me,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.940
I pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.860
and she say to me, both drink thou,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.000
and I will also draw for thy camels.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.500
Let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.540
out for my master's son.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.180
Now, I find that as he's giving this word of testimony,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.660
as he's rehearsing these events that have transpired

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.779
how that God had blessed and prospered his journey,

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:07.180
I find that the excitement must be building up.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.400
As he begins to discuss, as he shares about Abraham

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.419
and how he'd been blessed and how he was great

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:16.380
and all that he had, surely there was a level of excitement

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.279
explaining those things, and then as he gets to the point

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:21.860
as to why he was there and that he was by the well

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.100
and how he prayed, and there's a measure of excitement,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.740
but now it kind of reaches a climax, if you will,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.139
when we come to verse number 44,

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:33.940
and it says, excuse me, verse 45,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.260
and before I had done speaking in my heart,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.059
behold, Rebecca came forth

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.699
with her pitcher on her shoulder,

00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:45.419
and she went down unto the well and drew water,

00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:48.220
and I said unto her, let me drink, I pray thee,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.619
and she made haste and let down her pitcher

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.180
from her shoulder and said, drink,

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.740
and I will give thy camels drink also,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.619
so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:03.699
Do you not imagine that he's excited as he's sharing this?

00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:05.860
Let me tell you why I'm here, let me introduce,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.580
now remember, they had provided a meal,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.220
it says in verse number 33,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.300
and there was set meat before him to eat,

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.360
but he said, I will not eat until I have told mine Aaron.

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:18.500
The meal is sitting there and that's fine

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.419
and appreciated and it's customary

00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:22.660
and it's culturally acceptable,

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.619
and he says, listen, I have something

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.820
that I need to share with you first,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.900
and I believe that the excitement continues to build

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.699
as he's sharing the story and as he begins to rehearse

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:35.360
and to speak about Rebecca coming forth

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.160
and how he spoke to Rebecca and what Rebecca's response was,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.660
it says in verse number 47,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.979
and I asked her and said, whose daughter art thou?

00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:46.220
And she said, the daughter of Bethuel,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.940
of Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.740
and I put the earring upon her face

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.300
and the bracelets upon her hands,

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.880
and I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.860
and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham,

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.020
which had led me in the right way

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.020
to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.300
And now, if you will deal kindly and truly with my master,

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.580
tell me, and if not, tell me,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.820
that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.339
Isn't that amazing?

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:19.160
As you begin to see how he's rehearsing,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.500
and again, if you would begin to think about the excitement

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.820
and as he told them how God worked,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.380
there's something unique about sharing a personal testimony

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.760
of how God has worked in your life,

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.119
how God has answered the prayer that you've prayed.

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:40.739
As you begin to acknowledge that you had no direction,

00:24:40.739 --> 00:24:43.320
you had no solution for the problem,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.500
the task that was assigned to Eleazar

00:24:46.179 --> 00:24:48.739
at the beginning of this chapter of Scripture,

00:24:48.739 --> 00:24:53.739
this task that was assigned was beyond his ability.

00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:56.619
Can you imagine, again, as I mentioned

00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:57.899
at the beginning of the message,

00:24:57.899 --> 00:25:00.100
this is a weighty responsibility,

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.660
but he trusts the Lord, he depends upon the Lord,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.299
he prays specifically, and now he's rehearsing

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:09.700
this before Laban and the family of Rebekah,

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.980
and I can't imagine how they're just hearing.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.820
Can you imagine they're hearing, and he's sharing,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.899
and there's no manipulation,

00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:21.059
there's no manufacturing of circumstances and events.

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:23.700
He's saying, this is what God did.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.660
This is how God worked.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.540
Now, what's your response?

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.619
It's interesting how he leaves it to them

00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.860
in verse number 49, and now,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.019
if you will deal kindly and truly with my Master,

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:39.779
tell me, and if not, tell me,

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.220
that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.179
We've noticed and we've mentioned already

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:47.980
that he requested God's favor,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.220
he recognized God's provision,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.019
he rejoiced for answered prayer,

00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:54.339
he rehearsed the events.

00:25:54.339 --> 00:25:56.899
I want you to notice number five,

00:25:56.899 --> 00:26:00.140
their response to the situation.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.980
There being Laban and Bethuel and the family of Rebekah,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.540
the Bible tells us in verse number 50

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.380
that they answered, they responded,

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.459
and as they have heard all that had taken place,

00:26:13.459 --> 00:26:17.100
now again, put yourself in the dialogue here,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.820
put yourself in the event.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.739
When Rebekah went out to go draw water,

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:24.140
it was not expected that she was gonna return

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.580
with some guy that says, hey, back home,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.660
my Master Abraham has a son,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.059
and your daughter's supposed to marry him.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.619
That wasn't the expectation when Rebekah left that night.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.299
Right?

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:42.540
Rebekah, no doubt, had done this more than once.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.660
She knew what she was doing,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.779
she lets down the water,

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:48.899
and she's the pitcher of water,

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:51.860
not only for Eleazar, but for all of those camels,

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.100
and she runs back and draws and comes back

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.140
and fills the trough,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.619
and she knew what she was doing,

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.619
no doubt she had done this before.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.179
I'm expecting, I'm believing,

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:04.140
as I look at the passage of Scripture,

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.720
that this had not happened before,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.559
that somebody comes home with her and says,

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.040
you know what I'm saying?

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.320
And Eleazar says, here's what God has done,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.080
here's how God has worked,

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.799
so how do they respond?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.080
They respond by acknowledging the hand of God.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.160
It says in verse number 50,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.720
then Laban and Bethuel answered and said,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.799
the thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:37.399
We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.279
I love the way that as you look at verse number 50

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:45.080
and you see the response of the family of Rebekah,

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.360
that you have the opportunity to see

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.839
the way in which Eleazar,

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:54.200
through simply rehearsing what God did,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.080
how that the Spirit of God,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.200
and I understand the Holy Spirit indwells us,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.600
and did not indwell Old Testament believers

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.720
in the same manner,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.519
but the Spirit of God no doubt confirmed to them

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:08.679
that this thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:12.119
And if this thing proceedeth from the Lord,

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:15.720
then who are we to say no, right?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.559
How can we speak bad or good with regard to this thing?

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:23.720
And we notice that they acknowledge the hand of God,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.559
and it's important that we understand this evening

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.600
as we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.559
how it is that they acknowledge the hand of God.

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:35.520
It's because of that specific prayer of Eleazar,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.200
it's because of how God answered the prayer of Eleazar

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.280
that they are able to acknowledge

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.359
that this thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:46.559
Had he not prayed specifically,

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:50.520
had he not had that specific nature of his prayer

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.919
as was recorded in verses 12 through 14,

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:54.919
specifically in verse number 14,

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:57.200
had he not prayed in that manner,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.919
he could not have rehearsed to the family

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.440
what he rehearsed.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:04.760
He could have just come to the house and said,

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.599
listen, I prayed that God would show kindness,

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:10.039
and man, this is the most beautiful woman

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.039
that I found down here,

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:13.840
and therefore I must expect that this is the wife,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.119
the bride for my servant Isaac.

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:18.080
No, no.

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:23.799
How's that processed by Laban and by the family, right?

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:26.280
He says, no, I prayed specifically.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.599
See, when you seek the face of God in that manner,

00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:33.880
when you understand that our God is able

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.599
to answer specifically,

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:36.919
and you rehearse those things,

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:40.119
you say, let me tell you what God has done.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:43.200
Let me show you how God has worked.

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:48.640
The response is, this thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.320
They can see the hand of God.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.159
And that, my brethren, is the way that we should

00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:57.720
seek to exalt the name of our God,

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.559
we should lift up his name when we.

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:03.359
to understand that He is able to answer,

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:07.099
that He is able to do things exactly

00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:09.999
in a manner in which would bring honor and glory

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:10.999
to His name,

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.339
that it would not be,

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:15.099
well, how do I know that was really God that did that

00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:17.339
and not that you just figured out this way

00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:19.519
to do this and so on and so forth?

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:22.479
No, no, no.

00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:24.199
This is what God did.

00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:25.279
This is how God works.

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.679
Psalm 109 and verse 27,

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:29.839
it says this, verse 26 is a prayer,

00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:31.759
it says, help me, oh, Lord, my God.

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:33.679
Oh, save me according to thy mercy.

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.639
That's Psalm 109 and verse 26.

00:30:35.639 --> 00:30:37.999
And verse 27 continues and says this,

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:40.999
that they may know that this is thy hand

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:43.079
that thou, Lord, hast done it.

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:46.719
Psalm 109, 26 and 27.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:49.959
And I believe that as we look at this passage of scripture

00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:51.719
in Genesis 24,

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:54.199
that as Eleazar is rehearsing

00:30:54.199 --> 00:30:56.639
and reviewing all that has transpired,

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:58.959
the response to the situation

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:03.959
is one that is a direct result to the circumstances.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:07.000
How could they say anything other?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.699
The uniqueness of the prayer request,

00:31:11.699 --> 00:31:15.319
the uniqueness of the response of Rebekah,

00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:19.559
she didn't know that that's exactly how Eleazar had prayed.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.759
I don't know who you are and you're asking me for water?

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:28.759
I mean, out of the kindness of my heart, here's some water.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.439
You better find somebody else.

00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:34.279
It didn't work that way.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:35.479
It didn't work that way.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.879
She didn't know how he prayed

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:44.000
so that her response would fit the prayer.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.040
She didn't know that.

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:47.979
And that's unique.

00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:52.559
And that's exciting to see how God is able to work.

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:58.279
We find that their response to the situation

00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:01.519
was an acknowledgement of the hand of God

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.919
and Eleazar immediately rejoices again.

00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:08.319
As we notice what takes place,

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:10.559
it says that in verse 52,

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.319
and it came to pass that when Abraham's servant

00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:14.319
heard their words,

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:17.759
he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:19.039
I did not read verse 51.

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:20.639
It says, behold, Rebekah is before thee.

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:22.360
Take her and go.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.520
And let her be thy master's son-wife

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.160
as the Lord hath spoken.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.160
Can you imagine as Eleazar heard those words?

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.500
When he heard the thing proceedeth from the Lord,

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.720
when he heard take her and go

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.720
and let her be thy servant's wife

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.199
as the Lord hath spoken,

00:32:42.199 --> 00:32:45.059
how that must have encouraged his heart.

00:32:45.959 --> 00:32:49.959
We find again, just as we noted in verse 26 and 27,

00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:51.599
how that he bowed and worshiped

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:54.399
and blessed the Lord for answered prayer,

00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:57.520
that it says that when Abraham's servant heard their words,

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.959
he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.

00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:07.919
Immediately after the response of the family

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:10.399
and after his worship of the Lord,

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:12.839
the Bible tells us that in the next few verses,

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:16.080
there's a discussion with regard to the departure.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.919
It says that the servant brought forth jewels of silver

00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:22.679
and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to Rebekah.

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:24.039
He gave also to her brother

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:25.720
and to her mother precious things.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.440
And they did eat and drink,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.160
he and the men that were with him,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.559
and tarried all night.

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.119
They rose up in the morning and he said,

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:34.239
send me away unto my master.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.919
He did not desire to tarry for any length of time.

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:40.380
This was a mission that he was on,

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.360
a responsibility that he had given from his master Abraham.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.880
And he was ready to depart.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.119
He had a desire, of course,

00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:49.559
for Rebekah to return with him.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:51.639
The Bible says in verse number 55,

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:53.279
and her brother and her mother said,

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:56.479
let the damsel abide with us a few days,

00:33:56.479 --> 00:34:01.039
at the least 10, after that she shall go.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.160
Now, 10 days really isn't that long.

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.839
It really isn't.

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.660
But I see a measure of excitement

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.759
here in this text of Scripture,

00:34:10.759 --> 00:34:13.360
coupled with, remember, the faith of Abraham.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.799
Abraham, I believe, the text doesn't tell us this,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.880
but I believe that Abraham was probably praying

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.720
for Eliezer to have a prosperous journey.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.720
As Abraham sends Eliezer on the way,

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.540
as Abraham reveals and communicates to his servant

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.919
his faith and his confidence and how God was going to work,

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:33.040
he didn't know exactly what God was going to do,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.559
but he knew that God would work.

00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:38.320
And he, Eliezer, no doubt, has a desire.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.880
I wanna get back to Abraham.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.179
I wanna get back to Isaac.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.919
I mean, I don't wanna wait 10 days.

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:46.639
He says, at the least 10.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.760
You mean it could be more?

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.079
No, no, I wanna get back.

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:52.459
There's excitement.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.500
He said unto them, hinder me not.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.799
Notice again this phrase,

00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:02.299
seeing the Lord hath prospered my way,

00:35:02.299 --> 00:35:05.059
send me away that I may go to my master.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.399
How did he know that God had prospered his way?

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:12.160
Because he prayed specifically.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.239
And God answered.

00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:16.919
And God answered.

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.359
And he says, send me away.

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:23.119
And it says in verse number 58,

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.040
it says, well, in verse 57, it says,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.720
they said, we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.200
They called Rebekah and said unto her,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.040
wilt thou go with this man?

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.720
I know there's probably not a lengthy pause,

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.040
but you ever been in a situation

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.160
where a second feels like 10 minutes?

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:44.279
Right, that pause of a moment

00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:46.720
seems like eternity almost.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.519
You know what I mean?

00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:52.559
And when they say, wilt thou go with this man?

00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:57.720
In my mind's eye, Eliezer is there waiting for a response.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.839
And though the delay may have been just a nanosecond,

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:07.339
he's probably anxiously awaiting the response.

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:12.700
And she said, I will go.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:15.100
I will go.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.260
Man, I don't know what Eliezer did.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.660
I don't know if he leaped.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.139
I don't know what he did.

00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:24.179
But I think he's excited about all that has transpired.

00:36:24.179 --> 00:36:27.500
He's already mentioned about the Lord prospering his way.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.619
And now as Rebekah is called in,

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:31.739
and she's asked, wilt thou go with this man?

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:34.019
She says, I will go.

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:36.980
Oh, the excitement.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.220
In verse 60, she's blessed by her family,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.980
it says, and they blessed Rebekah and said unto her,

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:45.419
thou art our sister.

00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:48.179
Be thou the mother of thousands of millions

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:52.019
and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:58.100
As we think about this response to the situation again,

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.899
I mean, Rebekah had gone out the day before

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.059
to get some water and how the lives

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:11.059
of these Bible characters have changed in just a moment.

00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:16.899
But God's hand is evident, clearly evidenced

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.220
in the text of Scripture that God is at work,

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.739
that God is moving, that God is directing.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.940
We find that their response, again,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.980
not to belabor the point too much,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.540
but their response, I believe, is the direct result

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.700
of the specific nature of the prayer of Eleazar.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.419
Because he prayed specifically,

00:37:38.419 --> 00:37:41.260
he was able to rehearse those events,

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.220
which impacted, influenced the way that they responded.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.820
And their response was one of agreement.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.859
Their response was one of blessing.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.540
We find number six this evening, the return home.

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:03.019
In verses 61 through 67,

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:06.739
God gives us the record of their return.

00:38:06.739 --> 00:38:09.579
It says that Rebekah arose in her damsels

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:12.419
and they rode upon the camels and followed the man

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:16.579
and the servant took Rebekah and went his way.

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:18.459
The Bible tells us now of Isaac,

00:38:18.459 --> 00:38:20.540
he came from the way of the well,

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.540
Lehiroi, for he dwelt in the south country.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.779
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field

00:38:27.779 --> 00:38:30.380
at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.820
and saw and behold, the camels were coming.

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:39.859
Level of excitement, a level of anticipation.

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:41.900
Is Eleazar coming back with a bride?

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.380
Is he coming back empty-handed?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.580
I mean, what's going on?

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.500
And we find that he's there.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.380
It tells us that he came from the way of the well,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.940
Lehiroi, that he was now in the field

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.059
and he was meditating at eventide

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:57.500
and he lifts up his eyes and he sees

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.219
and Rebekah, she also lifted up her eyes

00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:03.700
and she saw Isaac and she lighted off the camel

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.779
and said unto the servant, Eleazar,

00:39:05.779 --> 00:39:09.739
what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?

00:39:09.739 --> 00:39:12.779
The servant had said, it is my master.

00:39:12.779 --> 00:39:15.659
Therefore, she took a veil and covered herself.

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:19.140
There's another rehearsing that takes place

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.539
in verse 66 where the Bible tells us here

00:39:22.539 --> 00:39:25.739
as they arrive that now there's this explanation

00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:30.739
and the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.940
We will not take the time this evening

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.059
to backtrack through the entirety

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:36.619
of the passage of scripture,

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:40.739
but we understand that as this dialogue takes place

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:43.840
and it's summarized in one single verse of scripture

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.020
that Eleazar is now communicating to Isaac

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.880
all that had transpired and how God had prospered his way.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.779
I believe that Isaac was no doubt excited

00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.500
at hearing all that had transpired as.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.859
as Isaac would understand the task that had been assigned,

00:40:03.859 --> 00:40:05.300
as Isaac would understand

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.219
and had been anticipating the return of Eleazar

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:11.260
and understanding that his bride no doubt

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.060
was to accompany him back home.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.500
And we find that here is Rebekah

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.379
and Eleazar explains all that has transpired.

00:40:21.379 --> 00:40:26.180
He told Isaac all things that he had done.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.340
It's exciting to hear how God works.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.540
It is.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.900
It's exciting to see the hand of God

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.500
at work in your life.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.060
And to be able to rejoice

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.939
and to be able to rehearse

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:48.060
and to speak of the greatness of God.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.419
The Bible tells us that this explanation

00:40:50.419 --> 00:40:52.500
is provided in verse 67.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.700
We find the consummation of marriage.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.700
It says that Isaac brought her,

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.779
speaking of Rebekah,

00:40:57.779 --> 00:40:59.340
into his mother Sarah's tent

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.979
and took Rebekah and she became his wife

00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:04.380
and he loved her and Isaac was comforted

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.500
after his mother's death.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.580
As we look here at this consummation of the marriage

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.019
and we understand how that as we move forward

00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:15.419
through the book of Genesis,

00:41:15.419 --> 00:41:17.980
the importance of this chapter

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.860
and this event and all that has transpired,

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.580
and we understand how that God would bless

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.419
and we'll look at a number of things

00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:28.059
as we move through the book of Genesis

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:31.300
and really as we go back to the 24th chapter

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.260
and we remember how God divinely worked,

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.860
that will cause us as the people of God to rejoice.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.699
Our God is able to still work in like fashion.

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:48.260
Our God today still hears and answers prayer.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.860
Amen?

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.059
Listen, when we consider tonight

00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:54.580
this passage of Scripture,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.459
when we can rejoice

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.940
and we can look at all that has transpired

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.220
and take these six snapshots of these 67 verses

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.540
and we can say, man, look at this,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.500
look at what has happened.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.419
But the things that were written aforetime

00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:12.699
were written for our learning and for our admonition

00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.539
and so then faith cometh by hearing

00:42:14.539 --> 00:42:16.300
and hearing by the Word of God

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.020
and as we look at a passage of Scripture like this,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.020
we ought to rejoice that our God is able

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.820
and we ought to be challenged in our prayer life

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.539
to pray specifically.

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:33.059
It's a different context in Malachi than what we see here,

00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:35.740
but if you would allow me to take it out of context

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.660
for the purpose of application,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.580
there the context is with giving

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.539
and how God says prove me with regard to giving

00:42:44.539 --> 00:42:46.940
that God will bless and so on and so forth.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.820
That's the proper interpretation

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.899
as I've mentioned many times from this pulpit.

00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:54.619
Scripture has one interpretation but many applications

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.220
and I believe that we can take that phrase

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.380
that God says to His people in Malachi

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.059
and we can apply it in our lives today

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:05.539
in a broad sense of areas and say prove me.

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:07.660
God says prove me.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.580
Why are we scared to pray specifically?

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.779
Is it that we don't think God can answer specifically?

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:19.259
But when we see that Eliezer is praying specifically,

00:43:19.259 --> 00:43:21.580
something that for me this evening

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.259
is beyond my ability to fully comprehend

00:43:25.259 --> 00:43:27.820
as to how he prayed the way that he prayed

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.580
and how before he was done speaking,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.899
God's already answering.

00:43:33.899 --> 00:43:37.259
It's coming to pass exactly as he prayed.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.619
How encouraging.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.699
In a way in which Eliezer is able to say,

00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:47.339
God has prospered my way,

00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:49.580
God has shown kindness

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.779
and in a way, in a manner in which others

00:43:54.779 --> 00:43:58.740
that hear are able to say,

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.619
the thing proceedeth from the Lord.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.380
The thing proceedeth from the Lord

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.380
as the Lord hath spoken.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.020
That we would see God work in very distinct ways.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.019
I trust this evening that as we look at a passage

00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:20.899
of scripture like this, that we can rejoice

00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:24.260
in the way in which God provided a wife for Isaac.

00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:28.260
And certainly that should cause us to rejoice.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.420
But I hope tonight that we'd be challenged.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.339
That we'd be challenged in our own walk with God.

00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:37.700
We spoke this morning about being people of prayer.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.339
We see tonight about these specific prayers.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.500
The nature of his prayer.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.859
And how specific are we in our prayers?

00:44:48.339 --> 00:44:51.179
If we just say, God, would you bless that person?

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.380
If I pray for Ron this week and say, God, bless him,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.579
bless him real good.

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:03.420
Next Sunday I see Ron or Wednesday night I see Ron.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.260
Ron, how you doing?

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.100
I'm doing well.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.019
Yes, God answered my prayer.

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:07.500
God's blessing him real good.

00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:10.619
I mean, I don't even know what that means.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.140
You know why I don't know what that means?

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.059
Because sometimes we look at blessing

00:45:16.059 --> 00:45:18.380
being that everything's perfect and good

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.820
and just abundance of everything.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.619
But sometimes God's blessing comes

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:25.859
in different size and shapes, right?

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.619
A trial is a blessing.

00:45:30.779 --> 00:45:31.619
Amen?

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.619
And so all of a sudden Ron's going through a trial

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:36.660
and I prayed, God, bless him good, real good.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.059
And I'm saying, oh man.

00:45:39.059 --> 00:45:41.179
I mean, now he's got a trial.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.660
It's a mess.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.739
We begin to pray specifically.

00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:51.859
We see God answer specifically and it increases our faith

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.420
and it impacts others just as it did for Rebecca's family.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.140
As they're hearing this, tell me that part again.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:09.100
You were at the well and you prayed what?

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.420
Yeah, yeah, that's what I prayed.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.820
And Rebecca came.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.619
I mean, you were still kind of finishing up praying

00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:17.179
and then Rebecca's there, yep.

00:46:18.459 --> 00:46:19.820
And you went and asked Rebecca for water.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.019
Yep, that's what I did.

00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:22.700
And she said what?

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.100
She said she was gonna get water for all the camels?

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.500
Yep.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:32.500
I mean, it increases our faith, but it impacts others.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.059
Oh, that God would help us.

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:37.739
Tonight as we look at a passage like this

00:46:37.739 --> 00:46:40.579
to be encouraged, but to be challenged.

00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:41.940
Father, we love you.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.700
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.660
Thank you for the word of God,

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.339
the truth that is contained therein.

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:49.380
Thank you for an account.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.820
Genesis 24.

00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:58.140
All the details that are provided help us.

00:46:59.899 --> 00:47:02.420
It could have just told us that the servant of Abraham

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.420
went to the house of Rebecca.

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:12.739
And Rebecca returned to be the wife of Isaac.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.140
And that would be settled fact.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.619
But God, in your wisdom,

00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:25.899
you chose to provide us with all of these details

00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:32.899
that encourage us and I trust challenge us as well.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.540
I pray tonight you'd help us, Lord,

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.540
to rejoice in answered prayer.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.700
I ask, Lord, tonight that you'd challenge us

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.380
in our own prayer lives, individually and corporately.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.260
God, that you'd help us to pray specifically,

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:56.260
to help us to respond by rejoicing when you answer.

00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:01.299
That we'd have the opportunity to inform each other

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.260
that we'd have the opportunity to influence

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.619
and impact others.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.019
That we truly see what you're capable of doing.

00:48:13.859 --> 00:48:15.420
There's one not sure of heaven.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.019
I pray tonight, even as we sang that song,

00:48:19.019 --> 00:48:22.700
when I see the blood, they would understand.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.220
Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save.

00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:32.900
Because the blood of Christ is precious, powerful.

00:48:35.539 --> 00:48:37.979
Paul said this is a faithful saying

00:48:37.979 --> 00:48:39.460
and worthy of all acceptation,

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.020
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.979
to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:49.020
Lord, would you work in these few moments of invitation?

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.500
Would you speak to hearts?

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.419
Would you help us, Lord, to respond,

00:48:53.419 --> 00:48:55.059
to be doers of the word?

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.619
We pray that you'd seal each decision

00:48:57.619 --> 00:48:58.619
and we'll thank you for it.

00:48:58.619 --> 00:48:59.979
In Christ's name we pray.
