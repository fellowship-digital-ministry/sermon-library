1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
what a great truth and we're looking forward to going through that passage of Scripture on Wednesday nights here over the next several weeks this

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,239
morning if you have a Bible with you turn to the book of 1st John if you will

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,960
1st John chapter 3 and some of you are already in Colossians expecting for us to be in Colossians this morning

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,399
You'll have to just keep turning further in the New Testament get to the book of 1st John and of course many of you know

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,639
I hope that none of you have forgotten that today is Valentine's Day

6
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:30,940
And it's kind of interesting as we think about the the special day that is on our calendar today

7
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:36,659
We understand there are many that will seek to express their love through various means in fact I read this morning

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,900
that in the United States of America the projected expenditure on

9
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,619
Valentine's Day is

10
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,619
22 billion dollars

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,220
that's a lot of money and

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,740
Some of you may have contributed to that fund right you went and got some flowers

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,419
you got a card you got maybe some chocolate and

14
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,099
purchasing those things and

15
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:02,419
we understand the way in which we would seek to

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,199
express our love and

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,260
The thing that's interesting and we understand the truth of the book of Ephesians

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,139
The Bible says that husbands that were to love our wives

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,180
The Bible says that were to love our wives in the same manner in which Christ loved the church and gave himself for it

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,699
And as we think about the the day today

21
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,459
Valentine's Day on the calendar

22
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:27,260
And many will seek to express love again

23
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,540
22 billion dollars nearly that's the projected expenditure

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,059
I'm not sure why they projected to be lower because last year it was

25
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:40,339
27.4 billion and so they've projected it to be lower this year

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,739
But needless to say that's a lot of money that will be spent by individuals seeking to express their love

27
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,059
And we find that as we would think about the subject matter of love as

28
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:57,099
certainly as the people of God we must reflect upon the love of God and

29
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,019
We think and we understand the Bible teaches us much about God's love and I'm so thankful

30
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:09,139
For the truth that God gives us with regard to his love for us as

31
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,779
We think about the love of God

32
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,179
We understand that the price that was paid to express his love for us

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,220
Far exceeds any dollar value we could ever put

34
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:29,179
That we would deal with here in our country because it was with the precious blood of Christ

35
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:36,139
We're not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold, but we're redeemed how with the precious

36
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:43,220
Blood of Christ as of a lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world is what Peter tells us and I'm so thankful

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,619
For that truth often we sing with the children Jesus loves me this I know

38
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:53,860
For the Bible tells me so and what a blessing to sing that song

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,880
One of the great hymns that we sing is a hymn that's entitled Jesus loves even me

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,460
Jesus loves even me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me

41
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:11,100
Jesus loves even me the songwriter said there are wonderful things that he reads in the Bible

42
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,820
But the dearest of them is this that Jesus loves me. And so if you're taking notes this morning

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,419
I've simply entitled the message Jesus loves you and you know, there's a

44
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:30,139
truth to that statement that would cause us as children of God to rejoice greatly and we understand what that means and we

45
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:37,100
Understand the significance of that statement when someone says to you that Jesus loves you it causes you to have

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Just a great

47
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:45,300
Comfort in knowing and recognizing being reminded of that truth

48
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:49,779
However, there are many in our world today that do not know the love of God

49
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,419
They do not understand

50
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,660
What it is that is meant when the Word of God says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten

51
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,619
Son that whosoever believe it than him should not perish, but have everlasting life. They don't understand

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,000
The full nature of the love of God in 1st John 3 in verse number 16 often

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,459
We can quote John 3 16 is of great interest that 1st John 3 16 is very similar to John 3 16

54
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,220
The Bible says this as John the Apostle is writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

55
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,739
Notice what he says hereby

56
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,980
perceive we the love of God

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,019
Because he laid down his life for us

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,820
Because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives

59
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,200
For the brethren want to focus on the first portion of this verse of Scripture this morning

60
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,899
Hereby perceive we the love of God

61
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,779
Because he laid down his life

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,480
For us that word perceive is an interesting word. The word means to know or to understand

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,480
It means to have knowledge of to perceive to have knowledge of and in John says hereby

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Perceive we the love of God

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Because he laid down his life for us

66
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,399
brother Michael told us how that they were gonna have a

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,320
meeting there in the Gambia and how that the

68
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:23,079
Preacher was gonna preach on the deity of Christ and what a great subject matter. What a great truth and we've dealt with

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,160
Often in in the recent weeks and months about the Lord Jesus Christ and that he is God and God in flesh and what a

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
blessing to

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
understand the truth of the

72
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,279
Incarnation and the deity of Christ and the eternality of Christ

73
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,000
In fact, we started the book of Colossians last Sunday morning

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,480
we dealt with the subject matter of the exalted Christ and how

75
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:52,559
Wonderful he is and you find in this text of Scripture see there are many today that still deny the fact that Jesus is God

76
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,320
They're okay with saying that Jesus is a prophet a teacher a good man

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,200
So on and so forth, but we find that Jesus is God

78
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,399
The Apostle Paul as he's preaching and teaching and he goes to the city of Thessalonica. He says that this Jesus is

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,480
The Christ the Messiah the anointed one the promised one but notice here

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,079
there are many portions of Scripture that you can go to to acknowledge and understand the

81
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,679
The the deity of Christ and the fact that he is God notice what is said here pot hereby perceive

82
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,480
We the love of God because he laid down his life

83
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:38,000
for us who was it that went to the cross of Calvary Jesus Christ, he is God and

84
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,640
That's just a side note for free this morning. But there are some that still

85
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:48,000
Have difficulties with that question that Jesus asked to the disciples

86
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,880
Whom do men say that I the son of man am

87
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,440
they said some say that you're John the Baptist one of the prophets so on and so forth and

88
00:06:55,799 --> 00:07:00,920
Peter with great boldness and courage stands up after Jesus says but whom say ye that I am

89
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,959
Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
And it's amazing to me

91
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,119
How many in our society today in our world?

92
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,839
Continue to have confusion with regard to the person of Jesus Christ

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,839
and we know that's because of the enemy the evil one and

94
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:24,359
We find here the truth of the deity even revealed to us in this verse of Scripture

95
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:27,880
If you're taking notes this morning, I want to point this

96
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,000
Truth out number one to be confident of God's love for you

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,279
We need to be confident of God's love for us

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,079
The word confident means to have full belief

99
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,720
It carries with the idea of being fully assured positive without suspicion I

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,160
like this definition from the 1828 Noah Webster's dictionary, it says this having an

101
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,119
excess of assurance

102
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:03,600
to be confident having an excess of assurance to

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,339
have full belief to be fully assured and persuaded to be

104
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:15,500
Confident of the love of God as we would look at the passage of Scripture here in 1st John 3 in verse number 16 the

105
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,899
Word of God tells us that this is how we can know or understand to have knowledge of the love of God hereby

106
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,100
Perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us

107
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,299
We find that throughout the Word of God his love is declared for us

108
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,020
And I'm so thankful that God has declared his love for us in his word

109
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,020
But he goes far beyond simply declaring his love for us. We find that he demonstrated his love for us

110
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,200
We know the verse of Scripture in Romans 5 in verse number 8 where the Bible says but God

111
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,940
Commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us

112
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,260
You understand this morning that we do not deserve the love of God

113
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,719
You cannot earn the love of God. The truth of God's Word is that he loves you

114
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,679
You can't earn it

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,619
There are people trying to earn God's love

116
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:17,919
It's not anything of us that would cause God to love us. We were at enmity with him

117
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,580
Amen, but it's because of God's character in God's nature

118
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,080
It's because of the truth that John reveals to us even in this book in 1st

119
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,880
John 4 in verse number 8 again in verse number 16 of that same chapter. The Bible says God is

120
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,679
Love God is love

121
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,599
We know that there's much confusion about that subject matter this morning in the world in which we live and I do not seek

122
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:49,280
To spend a ton of time on that part or that aspect of things this morning

123
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,119
But we do understand there's confusion amongst the general populace with regard to what it means that God loves you

124
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,039
There are many today that would take that statement and they would say well

125
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,679
Well, God is love and that means I can do whatever I want to do because God is love.

126
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,679
And that's not truly what it means.

127
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,199
See, God's love, I know I've often said this, but it's certainly worth repeating.

128
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:20,159
The love of God is best described not as being permissive, but being protective.

129
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,319
It's a protective love.

130
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,999
It's not a permissive love.

131
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,399
If you love your children, you seek to protect them.

132
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,999
You don't just simply permit your children to do whatever they want to do because you

133
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:31,999
love them.

134
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,439
That'd be nonsense.

135
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,639
And God loves us, and we need to be confident of God's love.

136
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,239
The Bible says that God is love.

137
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:47,119
The Bible says this in 1 John 4, in verse number 19, we love Him, why?

138
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:51,119
Because He first loved us.

139
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,279
God doesn't love us because we loved Him.

140
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,239
We love Him because He loved us.

141
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,639
And the reality for some of us this morning, we can understand that there was a time in

142
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,199
which we were probably ignorant of God's love.

143
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:11,279
There was a time in which maybe for some they grew up in a Christian home and they grew

144
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,599
up in a church environment and they sang from the youngest of age, Jesus loves me, this

145
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,879
I know.

146
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,619
And they had understood the fact that God loves them.

147
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:27,459
And when I would have the opportunity, and even still today, if we have a vacation Bible

148
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:33,739
school and I'm leading songs and kind of overseeing the vacation Bible school, when we sing that

149
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:38,119
song I'll say to the children, can you tell me a verse that would prove that?

150
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:44,979
Because the song says, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.

151
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:50,459
It's important that the children understand that Jesus loves them is not based solely

152
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:57,059
upon my word or me telling them, it's based upon the truth of God's word.

153
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,379
And no doubt one of the little children will say, John 3, 16, for God so loved the world,

154
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:08,379
and it causes my heart to rejoice that they understand that truth.

155
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:13,219
But for some of us that did not grow up in that type of environment, maybe there was

156
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,539
a time that we were ignorant of the love of God.

157
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,039
We didn't know that God loved us.

158
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,479
We didn't understand what that meant.

159
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:27,599
We find that we love Him because He first loved us.

160
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:33,039
Paul in closing the book of 2 Corinthians is writing to that group of believers.

161
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,679
He refers to the Lord as being the God of love and peace.

162
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,759
It's interesting for in the book of 2 Corinthians he begins that book by speaking about, in

163
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:51,099
the first chapter, about the fact that He is the God of all comfort, and He is.

164
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:56,239
And then he closes the book by reminding the believers in Corinth that He is the God of

165
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,679
love and peace, and He is.

166
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,059
It's His nature.

167
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,439
It's who He is.

168
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,859
He's just.

169
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:10,239
We understand that truth and understand the way in which those particular attributes coincide

170
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:14,599
one with the other in perfect harmony because God is perfect.

171
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:19,919
Just to remind you of what Jesus said to the disciples often, turn back to John 13

172
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,759
if you will, often we are mindful of this truth in John 13 when the Lord Jesus Christ

173
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,439
would give this new commandment, and we often speak about the love that we're to have one

174
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:35,479
for another as the people of God, as the children of God.

175
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:42,359
And what a blessing to understand that Jesus said, by this, by our love one for another,

176
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:47,379
shall all men know that ye are my disciples.

177
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,079
The love that we have one for another.

178
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,039
But I want you to notice what He says in John 13 and verse 34.

179
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,999
A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, and then look at this phrase,

180
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:08,199
as I have loved you, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

181
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,159
He says to the disciples, as I have loved you.

182
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,479
If you look over in chapter number 15, a few pages over in verse number 12, again He

183
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,679
repeats this truth.

184
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:26,359
He says, this is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.

185
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:33,279
See, this truth this morning of being confident of God's love for you is important.

186
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,319
To have that full assurance, to have that excess of assurance, and we understand that

187
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:44,239
when we're fully assured, that when we have no suspicion about God's love for us because

188
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:48,559
we're confident, it's based upon the truth that's found in the Word of God.

189
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,679
God is not a man that He should lie.

190
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,359
He's given us, He's declared for us, He's demonstrated to us, His love for us.

191
00:14:55,359 --> 00:15:00,479
I want you to understand this morning, think about this, John, the Apostle John, he was

192
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,359
confident that Jesus loved him.

193
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,559
He was confident that Jesus loved him.

194
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,199
In fact, many of you know this, but look back, if you will, still in the book of John,

195
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,359
we'll look at a few more verses here in the book of John, go back, if you will, to chapter

196
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,679
number 13.

197
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,759
You were there in chapter 15, I'll just go back a few pages to John chapter number 13.

198
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,079
You'll be mindful that the passage of Scripture begins, I'll just read the end of verse number

199
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,079
1, that it says this, He loved them unto the end.

200
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,119
If you're familiar with the book of John, you'll understand and be mindful of the fact

201
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:39,639
that it's in this passage of Scripture in which Jesus will wash the feet of the disciples.

202
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,839
And He teaches them a lesson, He gives them that lesson with regard to service, and then

203
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,439
we come down and we continue to go through the chapter and we come to verse number 23.

204
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:52,919
In the Bible, look at verse 22, it says, then the disciples looked one on another, doubting

205
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,439
of whom He spake.

206
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,799
What was it that He said?

207
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,159
Well, Jesus said in verse 21, verily, verily, I say unto you that one of you shall betray

208
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,159
me.

209
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,399
Verily, verily, of a truth of a truth, one of you shall betray me.

210
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,479
And the disciples begin to look at one another, they're doubting of whom it was that Jesus

211
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,479
spake.

212
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:18,879
And look at verse 23, now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom, one of His disciples, notice

213
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,559
this phrase, whom Jesus loved.

214
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,559
Whom Jesus loved.

215
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,439
You know that the apostle John, if you study through the entire book of John, you'll find

216
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:32,039
that he does not refer to himself as John.

217
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,919
He refers to himself as the one whom Jesus loved.

218
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,479
Isn't that precious?

219
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:41,959
He was confident that Jesus loved him.

220
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,479
I don't believe there's any doubt in his mind, he had that full assurance.

221
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,799
He was fully persuaded, why?

222
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,559
Because he heard what was said, but he also was walking with the Lord Jesus Christ during

223
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,039
his earthly ministry, and no doubt, on more than one occasion, the Lord would express

224
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:05,759
his love, and the Bible says that this man, John, he refers to himself as the one whom

225
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,759
Jesus loved.

226
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,599
We see it in chapter number 20.

227
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,879
In chapter number 20.

228
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:17,159
Think about this, in verse number 1, it was the first day of the week, and here comes

229
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:23,799
Mary Magdalene early to the tomb, and of course it's after the crucifixion and burial.

230
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,919
The Bible says that she seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.

231
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,799
It says in verse number 2, then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other

232
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,439
disciple whom Jesus loved.

233
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,159
The other disciple whom Jesus loved.

234
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,359
Who is that other disciple?

235
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,359
John.

236
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,119
The other disciple whom Jesus loved.

237
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,279
And saith unto them, they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know

238
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,499
not where they have laid him.

239
00:17:55,499 --> 00:18:01,179
We find that as we go through the passage of Scripture, we understand the great day

240
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,819
that that was, and then we come to the end of the chapter, and we see that Jesus of course

241
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:12,059
appears to his disciples as they're gathered together, and you come to the 21st chapter,

242
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:18,019
it's in that chapter in which it's Peter that says, I go a fishing, and they say unto him,

243
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,979
we also go with thee.

244
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,179
And Jesus is going to show up.

245
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,619
They're out there on the boat, and they're going to try to fish, and of course the Bible

246
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:29,539
says that they caught nothing.

247
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,739
If you have some time to study between this passage of Scripture and the previous record

248
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:40,139
in which there was the draft of fishes when Jesus told them after a night of toiling and

249
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:46,459
catching nothing, he says, cast out into the deep for a draft of fishes, and Peter says,

250
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,539
Lord we've toiled all the night, nevertheless at thy word, and he let down the net, there's

251
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:57,219
such a great catch, and here Jesus calls and says, have you caught anything?

252
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,459
And they say, no, we've caught nothing.

253
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:07,459
The Bible says here in verse number seven, well let me back up, because in verse number

254
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:10,820
five it says, then Jesus saith unto them, children, have ye any meat?

255
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,139
They answered him, no, they'd caught nothing.

256
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:18,619
Verse six, he said unto them, cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall

257
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,019
find.

258
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,699
They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

259
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:36,059
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, it is the Lord.

260
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,339
Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his fisher's coat unto him

261
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,099
for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea.

262
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:49,059
We find that a little while later after the Lord was speaking to Peter and asking Peter,

263
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,299
do you love me?

264
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,739
And going through that portion of Scripture, and Jesus tells him in verse 19 to follow

265
00:19:54,739 --> 00:20:00,059
me, and Peter in verse number 20, it says, then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple

266
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,359
whom Jesus loved following."

267
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,859
See, we could look at a number of other passages

268
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,979
in the book of John,

269
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,819
but not only was John confident,

270
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,099
but the other disciples.

271
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,719
I mean, Mary Magdalene goeth to Him

272
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,219
that the Lord loveth.

273
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:18,899
And we find that John had this confidence,

274
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,659
this assurance of God's love for him.

275
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,739
I believe this morning that Paul

276
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,219
was confident that Jesus loved him.

277
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,579
In fact, we find that often Paul would preach

278
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,819
about the love of Christ.

279
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,659
Often, as he would minister to those

280
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:34,619
that God would give him the opportunity

281
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:35,619
to minister to,

282
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,019
he would speak about the great love

283
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,899
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

284
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,619
The love of God.

285
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:46,179
In Galatians 2, oftentimes we will recite

286
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,619
this verse of Scripture

287
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,139
and speak about the importance of living

288
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:53,299
the crucified life, if you will,

289
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,099
and understanding that we have

290
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,379
been bought with a price

291
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:57,779
and we're to glorify our Father

292
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:58,699
who is in heaven.

293
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,219
And we find that Paul,

294
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,019
as he would make this declaration here

295
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:05,540
to the believers in the region of Galatia,

296
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,579
he says this in Galatians 2,

297
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,299
I am crucified with Christ.

298
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,699
Nevertheless, I live.

299
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,939
Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

300
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,819
And the life which I now live in the flesh,

301
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,860
I live by the faith of the Son of God

302
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,659
who loved me.

303
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,099
Who loved me.

304
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:29,579
And gave Himself for me.

305
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,099
What did John say in 1 John 3

306
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,259
and verse 16?

307
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:36,579
Hereby perceive we the love of God,

308
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:40,979
because He laid down His life for us.

309
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,819
And Paul says here in Galatians 2

310
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,579
and verse 20 that He loved me

311
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,939
and gave Himself for me.

312
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,379
In the book of Ephesians in chapter 2,

313
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,339
Paul is beginning the passage

314
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,500
speaking about the condition of all mankind

315
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,259
being lost,

316
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,860
being separated from God

317
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,979
because of our sin.

318
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:07,699
Being dead in our trespasses and sins.

319
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,099
But you notice in Ephesians 2

320
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:11,819
and verse 4,

321
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,419
the Bible begins with these two words,

322
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,139
but God.

323
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,580
But God,

324
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,179
who is rich in mercy,

325
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,300
notice this,

326
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,940
that His great love

327
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,220
wherewith He loved us.

328
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,860
I believe this morning

329
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,179
that we need to be confident of God's love for us.

330
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,139
I believe this morning that

331
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:37,380
John was confident that Jesus loved him.

332
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,059
I believe this morning that Paul was confident

333
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,179
that Jesus loved him.

334
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,220
I wonder this morning,

335
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,020
how confident are we

336
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
that God loves us?

337
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,899
Are there times in which we doubt

338
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:51,539
the love of God?

339
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,619
Are there times in which

340
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:58,020
we are lacking that certainty?

341
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,220
I believe this morning that we need to be confident.

342
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,699
Remember, that word that John uses,

343
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,059
hereby perceive,

344
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,139
it means to know or understand,

345
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:07,500
to have knowledge of,

346
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,139
and it lends itself to being confident of something

347
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,580
because I know it

348
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,259
and I can have assurance of it.

349
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,300
I can be confident of it.

350
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,860
I wonder this morning as we think about

351
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,819
the Apostle Paul preaching about the love of God.

352
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,339
Certainly, he was convinced

353
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,139
and he was confident in this truth.

354
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:28,500
Thus, he proclaimed the message.

355
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,779
And what a great message it is.

356
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,699
I want to go over to the book of John

357
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,459
in the 11th chapter.

358
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,059
As we think about this really

359
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,139
as a first point,

360
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:40,779
but almost we can look at it as an introduction

361
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,339
because I want to look at the

362
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,300
really, we can't look at the entire passage

363
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,380
for sake of time,

364
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,419
but I want to look at John 11.

365
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,259
And if I were to give some outline points,

366
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,940
if you will, to the message this morning,

367
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,899
I'd say number one,

368
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,539
that we're to be confident of the love of God for us.

369
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,979
But then I'd say this, number two,

370
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,339
never allow circumstances

371
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,940
to cause you to doubt the love of God.

372
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,779
Never allow circumstances

373
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:14,739
to cause you to doubt the love of God.

374
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:15,860
You understand this morning

375
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,260
that the enemy wants you to doubt the love of God.

376
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,820
He does.

377
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,540
The enemy wants you to look at your circumstances

378
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,019
and look at the things that are taking place in your life

379
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,540
and perhaps some hardships that you're dealing with,

380
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,179
perhaps some adversities that you're facing in life.

381
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,980
And the enemy wants to whisper in your ear,

382
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,220
God doesn't really love you.

383
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,500
Because if God really loved you,

384
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,820
He wouldn't do this, that, or the other.

385
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,339
But we need to this morning,

386
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:50,059
see, we're confident of God's love,

387
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,820
and we need to never allow circumstances

388
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,980
to cause us to doubt that love.

389
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,700
What God has declared,

390
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
what God has demonstrated,

391
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,980
we can't let doubt creep in

392
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,859
and overcome what has been declared in the Word of God.

393
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,179
We see in John 11,

394
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,100
the reality is this passage of Scripture

395
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,459
is a really exciting passage of Scripture.

396
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:19,739
It's in this passage

397
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:22,019
that Jesus stands at the tomb of Lazarus

398
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,899
and says, Lazarus, come forth!

399
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,419
I mean, what a powerful passage of Scripture

400
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,859
is John 11.

401
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:32,220
But I want you to notice some things

402
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,940
in this passage that I hope will help us.

403
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,940
Because we find that we are to be confident

404
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,220
of the love of God,

405
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,579
but we find that there are times

406
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,579
in which our circumstances can be adverse.

407
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,779
There are times in which we deal with hardships in life.

408
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,980
And here in John 11, I want you to notice,

409
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,339
the Bible tells us about Lazarus being sick.

410
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,019
And notice in v. 3,

411
00:25:59,019 --> 00:25:59,940
it says this,

412
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,299
therefore his sisters,

413
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,700
we know those are Mary and Martha,

414
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,779
the sisters of Lazarus,

415
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,139
and they are going to send to Jesus,

416
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:10,459
if we understand what's taking place here,

417
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,540
in v. 2, it says,

418
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,660
it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment,

419
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,019
wiped His feet with her hair,

420
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,899
whose brother Lazarus was sick.

421
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:18,500
And so, Mary and Martha,

422
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,100
the sisters of Lazarus,

423
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,820
they sent unto Him.

424
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,419
Him is Jesus,

425
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,019
we understand as it begins saying this,

426
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,739
Lord.

427
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:29,459
And so they send to Jesus,

428
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,100
and I want you to notice what they say.

429
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,899
Behold,

430
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:39,820
He whom thou lovest is sick.

431
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,139
Now, could they not have just said,

432
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:47,940
Lazarus is sick?

433
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,859
Right?

434
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,100
In fact, they could have simply said,

435
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,339
our brother is sick.

436
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,500
Jesus knew who it was.

437
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,619
Jesus knew the family.

438
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,859
But when they send to Jesus,

439
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,540
I love the expression.

440
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,339
They say, Lord,

441
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:07,859
behold,

442
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:13,100
He whom thou lovest is sick.

443
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,940
Now I believe, without being able to go through

444
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,579
the entire passage of Scripture this morning,

445
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:22,619
that Mary and Martha probably had the thought

446
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,980
that because Jesus loved Him,

447
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,299
that Jesus was going to come and heal Him.

448
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,739
Because when Jesus arrives,

449
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,899
the first response of Martha and Mary

450
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:37,820
is that if you had been here,

451
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,579
He would not die.

452
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:41,299
Look at it and you can read the whole passage

453
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,179
and you can see that.

454
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,820
And so I believe that in their mind,

455
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,700
they understood who Jesus was.

456
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,339
No doubt they had heard of and seen miracles.

457
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,100
They knew what He was capable of doing,

458
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,980
for they expressed, they say,

459
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,540
if thou hadst been here,

460
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
my brother had not died.

461
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,459
What does that communicate to us?

462
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,220
That Jesus could have healed him.

463
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,739
So when they send to the Lord,

464
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:08,779
they say, Lord,

465
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,179
behold,

466
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,179
He whom thou lovest is sick.

467
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,820
And then the Bible tells us in v. 4,

468
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,299
when Jesus heard that, He said,

469
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,779
this sickness is not unto death,

470
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,500
but for the glory of God,

471
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,660
the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

472
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,179
Notice v. 5.

473
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,619
Now, Jesus loved Martha and her sister.

474
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,140
That's Mary and Lazarus.

475
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,179
It's interesting as I look at the passage of Scripture,

476
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,580
that Mary and Martha were confident

477
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,260
that Jesus loved Lazarus.

478
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
No doubt.

479
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,940
He whom thou lovest is sick.

480
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,739
They knew, they understood,

481
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:52,299
they had confidence that Jesus loved their brother.

482
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,539
And then we find in v. 5

483
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,940
that the Word of God reveals to us

484
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:04,820
that Jesus indeed did love Mary and Martha and Lazarus.

485
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,260
We understand there are times in which we can quote John 3.16

486
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,099
and we can speak about the fact that God so loved the world,

487
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,739
but when we really take and make it personal

488
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:19,099
that God loves me as an individual.

489
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,779
He knows everything about you.

490
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,500
He knows everything about me and He still loves me.

491
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,059
And He still loves you.

492
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,099
Isn't that amazing?

493
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,700
It's amazing.

494
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,299
Those things that perhaps you'd hope

495
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,779
that no one else ever knew about you.

496
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,179
He knows.

497
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,619
And He still loves you.

498
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:43,419
Here, the confidence of the sisters,

499
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,380
Mary and Martha,

500
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,500
that Jesus loved and then the declaration

501
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,219
where the Bible tells us that Jesus did love them.

502
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:54,619
We understand that personally.

503
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,179
We find that as you would continue

504
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,059
to walk through the passage of Scripture,

505
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,939
Jesus would say,

506
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,279
look in v. 6 before He makes this statement,

507
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,899
when He had heard therefore that He was sick,

508
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,919
He abode two days still in the same place

509
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,699
where He was.

510
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,379
Now what would you desire?

511
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:21,219
An immediate departure.

512
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,019
You are not looking for a divine delay.

513
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,859
You're looking for an immediate departure.

514
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,219
Amen?

515
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:30,519
From Jesus two days.

516
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,619
It wasn't that He didn't receive the message.

517
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:34,899
It wasn't that He didn't know what was going on.

518
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,879
It's that He's God.

519
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,379
And He says, I have a plan.

520
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,419
I have a purpose.

521
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,059
I'm going to accomplish something here.

522
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,279
We find that after this delay,

523
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,299
it says that He said to His disciples,

524
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,539
let us go into Judea again.

525
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,899
And the disciples of course were concerned

526
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,059
because the Jews had sought to stone Him

527
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,659
and so on and so forth.

528
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,299
And we understand that if you go

529
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,819
through the entire book of John,

530
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,099
His hour was not yet come,

531
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,299
though it's not said specifically here.

532
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,299
But we know that when His hour was come,

533
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:07,139
that He would lay down His life.

534
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:10,299
But notice in v. 11,

535
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,419
these things said He,

536
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:14,180
and after that He saith unto them,

537
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,019
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth.

538
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,659
But I go that I may awake him out of sleep.

539
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,419
The Bible says that His disciples said,

540
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,099
If he sleep, he shall do well.

541
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:27,739
I mean, we heard that He was sick too.

542
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:29,899
And oftentimes, somebody says if you're sick,

543
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,540
get some rest.

544
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,619
And Jesus speaks plainly to them.

545
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:35,979
They did not understand

546
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,860
what Jesus was communicating to them.

547
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,979
And the Bible says in v. 13,

548
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,899
Howbeit Jesus spake of His death,

549
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,500
but they thought that He had spoken

550
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,979
of taking rest and sleep.

551
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:46,860
And then Jesus said unto them plainly

552
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,619
in v. 14, Lazarus is dead.

553
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,500
Lazarus is dead.

554
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,099
And in v. 15,

555
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,659
I cannot develop all of this.

556
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:01,899
I've preached from this passage of Scripture before

557
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:04,659
and focused more upon the truth of v. 15

558
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,259
than I have upon the love

559
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,380
that we're focusing on this morning.

560
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,059
We find in v. 15, the Bible says,

561
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:14,580
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.

562
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,979
I was glad for your sakes that I was not there.

563
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:23,979
For the intent ye may believe.

564
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:28,419
Nevertheless, let us go unto Him.

565
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,539
You know, there are some times in your life,

566
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,539
there are some times in my life,

567
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,459
there's a situation that's recorded here

568
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:38,940
in the lives of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus

569
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,979
in which God is seeking to do something great.

570
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,739
And He's seeking to stretch us

571
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:48,819
and grow us and develop us.

572
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:50,500
And in those circumstances,

573
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,419
because of our human nature,

574
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:55,619
we can sometimes feel isolated.

575
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,779
Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed.

576
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,419
And we can come to the place

577
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,699
where the enemy at that moment

578
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:05,339
will come and say,

579
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:09,899
Jesus doesn't really love you.

580
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,899
We believe this morning He can do anything.

581
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,059
He could heal this man from a distance.

582
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,979
He could have immediately went.

583
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:21,220
He could have prevented this.

584
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,699
But you understand this morning

585
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,539
that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

586
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,779
that it wasn't because He didn't love them.

587
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:31,339
He's trying to develop them.

588
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,300
If you'd been here,

589
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,979
you wouldn't have died.

590
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:37,940
Fast forward, if you will,

591
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,580
to the passage of Scripture

592
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,660
in v. 32,

593
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,419
when Mary was come where Jesus was

594
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:44,580
and saw Him,

595
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,020
she fell down on His feet saying unto Him,

596
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,179
Lord, if Thou hadst been here,

597
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:48,179
my brother had not died.

598
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,220
The same words that Martha spoke earlier

599
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,419
in the passage of Scripture.

600
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,020
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping

601
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,139
and the Jews also weeping

602
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:55,300
which came with her,

603
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,099
He groaned in the Spirit and was troubled.

604
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:58,419
Those Jews that were there,

605
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:00,259
it was a very custom, cultural thing

606
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:01,300
that would take place.

607
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,459
The death of a loved one

608
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,619
where some folks would come

609
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:04,860
and they would be the mourners.

610
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,419
And they would weep and mourn

611
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,459
and so on and so forth.

612
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,300
And the Bible says in v. 34

613
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,259
that Jesus said,

614
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,380
where have you laid Him?

615
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,259
And they said unto Him,

616
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,500
Lord, come and see.

617
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,859
And then the Bible says here in v. 35,

618
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,700
Jesus wept.

619
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,459
Jesus wept.

620
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:25,059
And then the Bible says this in v. 36,

621
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,220
Then said the Jews,

622
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,500
these mourners that were there,

623
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,779
Behold, how He loved Him.

624
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:37,899
Behold, how He loved Him.

625
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,019
And this morning,

626
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,299
the truth of God's love

627
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:44,019
and being confident of God's love

628
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,339
will bring us to a place

629
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,779
where we're never going to allow

630
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,059
circumstances to cause us

631
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,299
to doubt the love of God.

632
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:52,779
Because I'm confident that God has declared

633
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:53,859
and He's demonstrated,

634
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,260
hereby perceive we the love of God

635
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,179
because He laid down His life for us.

636
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:02,179
And we find here in the passage of Scripture

637
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,739
that there were some of those Jews

638
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:06,179
that also said in v. 37,

639
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,660
Could not this man,

640
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,139
speaking of Jesus,

641
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:11,660
which opened the eyes of the blind,

642
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,059
and you would look back in John 9

643
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:15,859
and see that great miracle.

644
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:16,820
And the Bible says,

645
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,019
have caused that even this man

646
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,579
should not have died.

647
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,179
Even these Jews that were mourning,

648
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,619
they acknowledged the love

649
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,100
that Jesus had for this man Lazarus,

650
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,700
but they also acknowledged the fact

651
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,660
that Jesus could have prevented his death.

652
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,019
But remember what He said back

653
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:39,779
in the 15th verse,

654
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,299
I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there

655
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:46,019
to the intent you may believe.

656
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,820
Jesus will stand at that tomb.

657
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,660
And He says, take ye away the stone.

658
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,779
In v. 39.

659
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,940
Of course, there's an objection.

660
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,339
He hath been dead for four days

661
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,660
and surely by now he stinketh.

662
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,059
Jesus said, roll back that stone.

663
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,500
In v. 43, it says,

664
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,700
when He thus had spoken,

665
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,940
He cried with a loud voice,

666
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,700
Lazarus, come forth.

667
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,739
Lazarus, come forth.

668
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:23,500
And the Bible says,

669
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,660
he that was dead came forth,

670
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,059
bound hand and foot with grave clothes.

671
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,100
And his face was bound about with a napkin.

672
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Jesus saith unto them,

673
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,540
loose him and let him go.

674
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,339
And I want you to notice in v. 45,

675
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,419
the Bible begins with this word, then.

676
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:37,940
Then.

677
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,299
Then.

678
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,619
Many of the Jews which came to Mary

679
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,260
and had seen the things which Jesus did,

680
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,459
what's it say?

681
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,739
Believed on Him.

682
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:52,380
Believed on Him.

683
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,260
Then.

684
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,859
They already believed that He could heal them.

685
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,380
Martha believed it.

686
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,779
Mary believed it.

687
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:04,019
The Jews believed it.

688
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:08,579
But because of that divine delay of Jesus,

689
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,339
now He's dead for four days

690
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:13,540
and He calls Him forth out of the grave.

691
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,380
Then they believed

692
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,820
because they saw this great miracle.

693
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,940
Remember, the Bible said in v. 4

694
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,660
that this sickness is not unto death

695
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,859
but for the glory of God

696
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:26,339
that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

697
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:29,220
In John 9, the passage that deals with the blind man

698
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:31,260
that was healed,

699
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,139
the Bible says that the disciples asked Him,

700
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,779
saying, Master, who did sin?

701
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,739
This man or his parents who was born blind?

702
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,579
And Jesus said neither hath this man sinned

703
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:39,579
nor his parents,

704
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:40,980
but that the works of God

705
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,739
should be made manifest in him

706
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,419
so that God would be glorified.

707
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:48,500
And we find in this passage of Scripture

708
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,059
that the Bible begins

709
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:55,899
as this particular event, if you will,

710
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,220
is recorded for us.

711
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,220
It begins by Mary and Martha

712
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,700
sending to Jesus and saying,

713
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:09,059
Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.

714
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:12,260
And then the Bible says a couple of verses later

715
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,700
that Jesus loved Martha and her sister

716
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,059
and Lazarus.

717
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,380
Even the Jews that were there as mourners,

718
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,260
they say, behold, how He loved him.

719
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,500
You know, it's very possible that a circumstance like this

720
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,380
could cause someone to doubt the love of God.

721
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,419
It could.

722
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,859
Because the enemy wants you to doubt the love of God anyway.

723
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,700
The enemy wants you to doubt everything that God said.

724
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,900
How do we know that?

725
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,539
Yea, hath God said.

726
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,179
Is that not how it started in the garden

727
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,299
in Genesis chapter number three?

728
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:50,140
Right?

729
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
Yea, hath God said.

730
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,020
Why is it that people struggle

731
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,700
with their confidence of their salvation?

732
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,779
Because people want to doubt.

733
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,260
Because the enemy wants to cause someone to doubt

734
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,099
what God said.

735
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,219
I don't know who it was.

736
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,340
I don't remember.

737
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,020
But a theologian of yesteryear said,

738
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,460
never put a question mark where God put a period.

739
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,500
I like that.

740
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,419
It's a simple statement.

741
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:16,179
But how true.

742
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:21,179
Listen, this morning, circumstances will change.

743
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:24,700
Circumstances will change.

744
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,940
Have you found it to be so?

745
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,700
Circumstances change.

746
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,020
Sometimes you feel like life is a roller coaster.

747
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,859
Right?

748
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:35,099
And oftentimes when you're up at the top

749
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,099
and things are going great

750
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:38,580
and you're on the mountaintop, so to speak,

751
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,099
and man, the blessings are flowing

752
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,219
and it seems like everything's going well,

753
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,900
typically at that time the enemy doesn't come whispering,

754
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,020
saying, God doesn't love you.

755
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,779
Oh man, because you ain't going to doubt God's love

756
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,500
when things are going wonderful.

757
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,340
But it's when that valley comes into play.

758
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,979
That roller coaster, if you will,

759
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,779
I hate roller coasters, by the way.

760
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:07,619
way, but that roller coaster, so to speak, comes down. I have to take Advil before I

761
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,999
go into the theme park, and then I take some with me so that later on I can take some more.

762
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:20,019
But the reality is that when you're in that valley, when those circumstances are challenging,

763
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:27,139
when it seems like everything's falling apart, when it feels like no one's near and no one

764
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:37,459
cares, the enemy's going to come. The enemy's going to say, you still think God loves you?

765
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:44,979
You still think that? Oh, be confident of it. Never allow circumstances to cause you

766
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:52,539
to doubt the love of God. Never put a question mark where God has put a period. Hereby perceive

767
00:40:52,539 --> 00:41:01,219
we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us. It's settled. He loves you.

768
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:08,619
He loves me. Circumstances are going to change, but God's love remains constant. Circumstances

769
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:16,019
will change, but God's love remains constant. Romans 8, look there at that great passage,

770
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:25,699
if you will. In Romans chapter number 8, Paul gives us a phenomenal declaration with

771
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:41,179
regard to the love of God. I'll begin reading in verse number 31. The Bible says this in

772
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:48,019
Romans 8 in verse number 31, what shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,

773
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:55,699
who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,

774
00:41:55,699 --> 00:42:02,699
how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the

775
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,259
charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is He that condemneth? It is Christ that

776
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:13,859
died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also

777
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:23,139
maketh intercession for us. Look at this question in verse 35. Who shall separate us from the

778
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:32,499
love of Christ? Those circumstances. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall

779
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:49,139
it be tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

780
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:58,059
Perhaps if we had time this morning to go through each one of those words that are mentioned,

781
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:05,499
we could find how in those circumstances, someone might feel like they've been separated

782
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:11,779
from the love of Christ. The enemy wants you to think that. As it is written in verse 36,

783
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:15,499
so that's why Paul is going to give us an answer, for thy sake we are killed all the

784
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:19,499
day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are

785
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:26,699
more than conquerors, notice this, through Him that loved us. And then notice the language,

786
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,059
for I am persuaded. Don't you like that word? I use the word confident in our message this

787
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:37,579
morning as our points, and again that word has the idea of being fully persuaded, fully

788
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:44,259
assured of, being positive, without suspicion, having an excess of assurance, and Paul says,

789
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:53,579
for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor

790
00:43:53,579 --> 00:44:01,339
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other

791
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:09,139
creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus

792
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:19,019
our Lord. The question of verse number 35, who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

793
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:25,259
Paul gives an answer in verse 38 and 39, he says, I am persuaded, if I could summarize

794
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:33,139
it, nothing, nothing, no other thing, no other creature, nothing can separate us from the

795
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:41,179
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This morning, when we're confident of

796
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:48,679
God's love for us individually, like John was, like Paul was, when we have that confidence

797
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:56,199
that God loves us, that we are fully persuaded and assured of, that we have that excess of

798
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:01,919
assurance that, as John said, hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His

799
00:45:01,919 --> 00:45:08,119
life for us. When I'm confident of God's love, I'm probably going to share that message

800
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:17,239
with more people, because I'm confident of it. Amen? If you're doubting it, if you're

801
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,239
not even sure that God loves you, you probably ain't going to tell anybody else that God

802
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:28,639
loves them. Right? Anyone ever ask you for a recommendation for dinner? I want to go

803
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,999
to a place, you know, where would you recommend? I was thinking about, it's Valentine's Day,

804
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:37,119
I was thinking about taking my wife to such and such place, and you've been there before,

805
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,719
and it was not very good. And what do you say? Well, I mean, maybe I'd go somewhere

806
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:50,479
else. You know, I don't know that I would go there. Why? Because you're not persuaded,

807
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:54,519
you're not confident yourself. So you're not going to make the recommendation that somebody

808
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:00,559
else goes there. But if you've been there, man, that was the best fill-in-the-blank I've

809
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:07,599
ever had. I mean, the steak there, the chicken parmesan, wherever you're going, it was great.

810
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:17,479
See, this morning when I am convinced of God's love for me, and I'm assured that what He's

811
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:23,079
done for me, He could do for others. Listen, our God is no respecter of persons. The Bible

812
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:30,199
plainly teaches us that. He's no respecter of persons. And I can go, and I've had, I

813
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:36,279
know I've shared already, I had more people this week, I had two, one on Friday, one yesterday,

814
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:43,919
and I said, man, I like your mask. Jesus loves you. I hate wearing that thing. I really

815
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:50,479
do. I don't like wearing a mask. I wear it as little as I possibly have to. But if I'm

816
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:53,959
going to have to go into an establishment and wear it, man, I want it to have a message

817
00:46:53,959 --> 00:47:02,559
that someone's going to read. I was at Costco on Friday. The lady at Costco, she's the cashier,

818
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,399
and she's starting to help the fellow that's in line in front of me, and she looks back

819
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:12,359
to just see if the lane there was filled up or whatever, and she saw my mask, and she

820
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,639
stopped dead stream in what she was doing, forgot about the guy who was in front of her

821
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,359
and said, I like your mask, where'd you get it? They probably won't let me wear it here,

822
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,679
but I'm going to wear it everywhere else. That's what she said to me. And the guy yesterday,

823
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:32,079
said, man, I like your mask. See, I've had some opportunities to talk to people because

824
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,639
of that, but I can tell them that God loves them. I can tell them of the love of God.

825
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,999
I'm confident in the truth. I'm confident. And we need to be careful never to allow circumstances

826
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:50,719
to cause us to doubt the love of God. There's some circumstances that we can face that are

827
00:47:50,719 --> 00:48:00,359
just, from human perspective, very challenging. When the doctor says the diagnosis is fill

828
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:08,039
in the blank. When the employer says, I'm sorry, but you got to make some cuts. I mean,

829
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:12,479
whatever the difficulty is, the reality is that there's something that can happen in

830
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:17,359
your life that's a difficulty that for somebody else, it doesn't even really faze them. And

831
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,919
then something happens in your life that seems to crush you, that somebody else just, it

832
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:29,079
is what it is. I mean, no big deal. We're all made up different. But when those circumstances

833
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:34,919
that are adverse come, would you understand this morning that circumstances are going

834
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:42,759
to change, but God's love is constant. There's nothing that can separate us from the love

835
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:52,359
of God. As many today will celebrate this holiday, spend nearly $22 billion on cards

836
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:59,399
and chocolate and flowers and whatever else. I hope this morning that we'd be reminded

837
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:08,639
of the love of God. Jesus loves you. What a precious truth that we find in the Bible.

838
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,199
We need to go through every day of our life, being confident of that. Maybe it'd be good

839
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:20,599
to refer to ourselves like John did. The one that Jesus loves. Isn't that good? Because

840
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:27,199
man, we're reminded every day and confident. God loves me. He loves me. Let's pray together.

841
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:33,399
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. Simple message

842
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:44,559
this morning, but your word is powerful. And I know how the enemy works. I know that the

843
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:55,239
enemy would like to cause the people of God to doubt the love of God. Especially when

844
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:00,279
those circumstances are overwhelming, challenging, adverse.

845
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:09,079
And God, I pray, even as we've picked through a little bit of John 11, would You help us

846
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,819
to never doubt Your love.

847
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:20,119
Never put a question mark where You put a period.

848
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,399
We'd have that confidence, that full assurance.

849
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:33,479
We thank You for the truth of Your Word that reveals to us the love that You have for us.

850
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:40,119
I pray that if there'd be one that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, they've never

851
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:48,099
fully understood this truth that God loves them.

852
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:54,999
He demonstrated that love by sending His Son to die upon the cross of Calvary.

853
00:50:54,999 --> 00:51:04,339
God in flesh paid with His precious blood a debt that could in no other way be paid,

854
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:05,819
that debt being sin.

855
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:12,439
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict sinners, convince them of their sin of Christ's

856
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:15,039
righteousness of judgment to come.

857
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,519
For us as the people of God, would You encourage us this morning through this truth?

858
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,359
Would You help us to, with confidence, declare this truth to others?

859
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,399
I pray that You'd have Your will in way in these few moments of invitation, for it's

860
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:29,259
in Christ's name we pray.

861
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:29,759
Would You stand with us?
