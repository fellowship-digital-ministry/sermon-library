00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
what a great truth and we're looking forward to going through that passage of Scripture on Wednesday nights here over the next several weeks this

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.239
morning if you have a Bible with you turn to the book of 1st John if you will

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.960
1st John chapter 3 and some of you are already in Colossians expecting for us to be in Colossians this morning

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.399
You'll have to just keep turning further in the New Testament get to the book of 1st John and of course many of you know

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.639
I hope that none of you have forgotten that today is Valentine's Day

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:30.940
And it's kind of interesting as we think about the the special day that is on our calendar today

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:36.659
We understand there are many that will seek to express their love through various means in fact I read this morning

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.900
that in the United States of America the projected expenditure on

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.619
Valentine's Day is

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:46.619
22 billion dollars

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.220
that's a lot of money and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.740
Some of you may have contributed to that fund right you went and got some flowers

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.419
you got a card you got maybe some chocolate and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.099
purchasing those things and

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.419
we understand the way in which we would seek to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.199
express our love and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.260
The thing that's interesting and we understand the truth of the book of Ephesians

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.139
The Bible says that husbands that were to love our wives

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.180
The Bible says that were to love our wives in the same manner in which Christ loved the church and gave himself for it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.699
And as we think about the the day today

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.459
Valentine's Day on the calendar

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.260
And many will seek to express love again

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.540
22 billion dollars nearly that's the projected expenditure

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.059
I'm not sure why they projected to be lower because last year it was

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:40.339
27.4 billion and so they've projected it to be lower this year

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.739
But needless to say that's a lot of money that will be spent by individuals seeking to express their love

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.059
And we find that as we would think about the subject matter of love as

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.099
certainly as the people of God we must reflect upon the love of God and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.019
We think and we understand the Bible teaches us much about God's love and I'm so thankful

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:09.139
For the truth that God gives us with regard to his love for us as

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.779
We think about the love of God

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.179
We understand that the price that was paid to express his love for us

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.220
Far exceeds any dollar value we could ever put

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:29.179
That we would deal with here in our country because it was with the precious blood of Christ

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:36.139
We're not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold, but we're redeemed how with the precious

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:43.220
Blood of Christ as of a lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world is what Peter tells us and I'm so thankful

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.619
For that truth often we sing with the children Jesus loves me this I know

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.860
For the Bible tells me so and what a blessing to sing that song

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.880
One of the great hymns that we sing is a hymn that's entitled Jesus loves even me

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.460
Jesus loves even me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:11.100
Jesus loves even me the songwriter said there are wonderful things that he reads in the Bible

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.820
But the dearest of them is this that Jesus loves me. And so if you're taking notes this morning

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.419
I've simply entitled the message Jesus loves you and you know, there's a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:30.139
truth to that statement that would cause us as children of God to rejoice greatly and we understand what that means and we

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:37.100
Understand the significance of that statement when someone says to you that Jesus loves you it causes you to have

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.740
Just a great

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:45.300
Comfort in knowing and recognizing being reminded of that truth

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.779
However, there are many in our world today that do not know the love of God

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.419
They do not understand

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:57.660
What it is that is meant when the Word of God says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:03.619
Son that whosoever believe it than him should not perish, but have everlasting life. They don't understand

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.000
The full nature of the love of God in 1st John 3 in verse number 16 often

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.459
We can quote John 3 16 is of great interest that 1st John 3 16 is very similar to John 3 16

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.220
The Bible says this as John the Apostle is writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:26.739
Notice what he says hereby

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.980
perceive we the love of God

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.019
Because he laid down his life for us

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.820
Because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.200
For the brethren want to focus on the first portion of this verse of Scripture this morning

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:47.899
Hereby perceive we the love of God

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.779
Because he laid down his life

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.480
For us that word perceive is an interesting word. The word means to know or to understand

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.480
It means to have knowledge of to perceive to have knowledge of and in John says hereby

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200
Perceive we the love of God

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.480
Because he laid down his life for us

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.399
brother Michael told us how that they were gonna have a

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.320
meeting there in the Gambia and how that the

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:23.079
Preacher was gonna preach on the deity of Christ and what a great subject matter. What a great truth and we've dealt with

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.160
Often in in the recent weeks and months about the Lord Jesus Christ and that he is God and God in flesh and what a

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.480
blessing to

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.480
understand the truth of the

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:38.279
Incarnation and the deity of Christ and the eternality of Christ

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.000
In fact, we started the book of Colossians last Sunday morning

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.480
we dealt with the subject matter of the exalted Christ and how

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:52.559
Wonderful he is and you find in this text of Scripture see there are many today that still deny the fact that Jesus is God

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:57.320
They're okay with saying that Jesus is a prophet a teacher a good man

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.200
So on and so forth, but we find that Jesus is God

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.399
The Apostle Paul as he's preaching and teaching and he goes to the city of Thessalonica. He says that this Jesus is

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.480
The Christ the Messiah the anointed one the promised one but notice here

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.079
there are many portions of Scripture that you can go to to acknowledge and understand the

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.679
The the deity of Christ and the fact that he is God notice what is said here pot hereby perceive

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:31.480
We the love of God because he laid down his life

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:38.000
for us who was it that went to the cross of Calvary Jesus Christ, he is God and

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.640
That's just a side note for free this morning. But there are some that still

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:48.000
Have difficulties with that question that Jesus asked to the disciples

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.880
Whom do men say that I the son of man am

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.440
they said some say that you're John the Baptist one of the prophets so on and so forth and

00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:00.920
Peter with great boldness and courage stands up after Jesus says but whom say ye that I am

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:03.959
Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.760
And it's amazing to me

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.119
How many in our society today in our world?

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.839
Continue to have confusion with regard to the person of Jesus Christ

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.839
and we know that's because of the enemy the evil one and

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:24.359
We find here the truth of the deity even revealed to us in this verse of Scripture

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:27.880
If you're taking notes this morning, I want to point this

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:33.000
Truth out number one to be confident of God's love for you

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.279
We need to be confident of God's love for us

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.079
The word confident means to have full belief

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:48.720
It carries with the idea of being fully assured positive without suspicion I

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.160
like this definition from the 1828 Noah Webster's dictionary, it says this having an

00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:59.119
excess of assurance

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:03.600
to be confident having an excess of assurance to

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.339
have full belief to be fully assured and persuaded to be

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:15.500
Confident of the love of God as we would look at the passage of Scripture here in 1st John 3 in verse number 16 the

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:22.899
Word of God tells us that this is how we can know or understand to have knowledge of the love of God hereby

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.100
Perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.299
We find that throughout the Word of God his love is declared for us

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:38.020
And I'm so thankful that God has declared his love for us in his word

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:45.020
But he goes far beyond simply declaring his love for us. We find that he demonstrated his love for us

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.200
We know the verse of Scripture in Romans 5 in verse number 8 where the Bible says but God

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.940
Commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.260
You understand this morning that we do not deserve the love of God

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.719
You cannot earn the love of God. The truth of God's Word is that he loves you

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.679
You can't earn it

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.619
There are people trying to earn God's love

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:17.919
It's not anything of us that would cause God to love us. We were at enmity with him

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.580
Amen, but it's because of God's character in God's nature

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:27.080
It's because of the truth that John reveals to us even in this book in 1st

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.880
John 4 in verse number 8 again in verse number 16 of that same chapter. The Bible says God is

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.679
Love God is love

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.599
We know that there's much confusion about that subject matter this morning in the world in which we live and I do not seek

00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:49.280
To spend a ton of time on that part or that aspect of things this morning

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.119
But we do understand there's confusion amongst the general populace with regard to what it means that God loves you

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.039
There are many today that would take that statement and they would say well

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:04.679
Well, God is love and that means I can do whatever I want to do because God is love.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:07.679
And that's not truly what it means.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:13.199
See, God's love, I know I've often said this, but it's certainly worth repeating.

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:20.159
The love of God is best described not as being permissive, but being protective.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:22.319
It's a protective love.

00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:23.999
It's not a permissive love.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:27.399
If you love your children, you seek to protect them.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:30.999
You don't just simply permit your children to do whatever they want to do because you

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:31.999
love them.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:35.439
That'd be nonsense.

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:39.639
And God loves us, and we need to be confident of God's love.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.239
The Bible says that God is love.

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:47.119
The Bible says this in 1 John 4, in verse number 19, we love Him, why?

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:51.119
Because He first loved us.

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:53.279
God doesn't love us because we loved Him.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:57.239
We love Him because He loved us.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:01.639
And the reality for some of us this morning, we can understand that there was a time in

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:05.199
which we were probably ignorant of God's love.

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:11.279
There was a time in which maybe for some they grew up in a Christian home and they grew

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:16.599
up in a church environment and they sang from the youngest of age, Jesus loves me, this

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:17.879
I know.

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:22.619
And they had understood the fact that God loves them.

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:27.459
And when I would have the opportunity, and even still today, if we have a vacation Bible

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:33.739
school and I'm leading songs and kind of overseeing the vacation Bible school, when we sing that

00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:38.119
song I'll say to the children, can you tell me a verse that would prove that?

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:44.979
Because the song says, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.

00:11:44.979 --> 00:11:50.459
It's important that the children understand that Jesus loves them is not based solely

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:57.059
upon my word or me telling them, it's based upon the truth of God's word.

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:03.379
And no doubt one of the little children will say, John 3, 16, for God so loved the world,

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:08.379
and it causes my heart to rejoice that they understand that truth.

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:13.219
But for some of us that did not grow up in that type of environment, maybe there was

00:12:13.219 --> 00:12:16.539
a time that we were ignorant of the love of God.

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:19.039
We didn't know that God loved us.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:23.479
We didn't understand what that meant.

00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:27.599
We find that we love Him because He first loved us.

00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:33.039
Paul in closing the book of 2 Corinthians is writing to that group of believers.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:39.679
He refers to the Lord as being the God of love and peace.

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:44.759
It's interesting for in the book of 2 Corinthians he begins that book by speaking about, in

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:51.099
the first chapter, about the fact that He is the God of all comfort, and He is.

00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:56.239
And then he closes the book by reminding the believers in Corinth that He is the God of

00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:59.679
love and peace, and He is.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.059
It's His nature.

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:02.439
It's who He is.

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:03.859
He's just.

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:10.239
We understand that truth and understand the way in which those particular attributes coincide

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:14.599
one with the other in perfect harmony because God is perfect.

00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:19.919
Just to remind you of what Jesus said to the disciples often, turn back to John 13

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:26.759
if you will, often we are mindful of this truth in John 13 when the Lord Jesus Christ

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:31.439
would give this new commandment, and we often speak about the love that we're to have one

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:35.479
for another as the people of God, as the children of God.

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:42.359
And what a blessing to understand that Jesus said, by this, by our love one for another,

00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:47.379
shall all men know that ye are my disciples.

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:49.079
The love that we have one for another.

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:54.039
But I want you to notice what He says in John 13 and verse 34.

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:59.999
A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, and then look at this phrase,

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:08.199
as I have loved you, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:12.159
He says to the disciples, as I have loved you.

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:17.479
If you look over in chapter number 15, a few pages over in verse number 12, again He

00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:18.679
repeats this truth.

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:26.359
He says, this is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.

00:14:26.359 --> 00:14:33.279
See, this truth this morning of being confident of God's love for you is important.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:39.319
To have that full assurance, to have that excess of assurance, and we understand that

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:44.239
when we're fully assured, that when we have no suspicion about God's love for us because

00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:48.559
we're confident, it's based upon the truth that's found in the Word of God.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.679
God is not a man that He should lie.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:55.359
He's given us, He's declared for us, He's demonstrated to us, His love for us.

00:14:55.359 --> 00:15:00.479
I want you to understand this morning, think about this, John, the Apostle John, he was

00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:03.359
confident that Jesus loved him.

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:05.559
He was confident that Jesus loved him.

00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:09.199
In fact, many of you know this, but look back, if you will, still in the book of John,

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:12.359
we'll look at a few more verses here in the book of John, go back, if you will, to chapter

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:14.679
number 13.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:18.759
You were there in chapter 15, I'll just go back a few pages to John chapter number 13.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:24.079
You'll be mindful that the passage of Scripture begins, I'll just read the end of verse number

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:29.079
1, that it says this, He loved them unto the end.

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:34.119
If you're familiar with the book of John, you'll understand and be mindful of the fact

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:39.639
that it's in this passage of Scripture in which Jesus will wash the feet of the disciples.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:43.839
And He teaches them a lesson, He gives them that lesson with regard to service, and then

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:48.439
we come down and we continue to go through the chapter and we come to verse number 23.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:52.919
In the Bible, look at verse 22, it says, then the disciples looked one on another, doubting

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.439
of whom He spake.

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:55.799
What was it that He said?

00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:02.159
Well, Jesus said in verse 21, verily, verily, I say unto you that one of you shall betray

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:03.159
me.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:07.399
Verily, verily, of a truth of a truth, one of you shall betray me.

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:11.479
And the disciples begin to look at one another, they're doubting of whom it was that Jesus

00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:12.479
spake.

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:18.879
And look at verse 23, now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom, one of His disciples, notice

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:23.559
this phrase, whom Jesus loved.

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:24.559
Whom Jesus loved.

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:28.439
You know that the apostle John, if you study through the entire book of John, you'll find

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:32.039
that he does not refer to himself as John.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:35.919
He refers to himself as the one whom Jesus loved.

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:38.479
Isn't that precious?

00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:41.959
He was confident that Jesus loved him.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:46.479
I don't believe there's any doubt in his mind, he had that full assurance.

00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:48.799
He was fully persuaded, why?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:54.559
Because he heard what was said, but he also was walking with the Lord Jesus Christ during

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:59.039
his earthly ministry, and no doubt, on more than one occasion, the Lord would express

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:05.759
his love, and the Bible says that this man, John, he refers to himself as the one whom

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:06.759
Jesus loved.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.599
We see it in chapter number 20.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.879
In chapter number 20.

00:17:11.879 --> 00:17:17.159
Think about this, in verse number 1, it was the first day of the week, and here comes

00:17:17.159 --> 00:17:23.799
Mary Magdalene early to the tomb, and of course it's after the crucifixion and burial.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:28.919
The Bible says that she seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:33.799
It says in verse number 2, then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:38.439
disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:41.159
The other disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:43.359
Who is that other disciple?

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.359
John.

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:48.119
The other disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:52.279
And saith unto them, they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:55.499
not where they have laid him.

00:17:55.499 --> 00:18:01.179
We find that as we go through the passage of Scripture, we understand the great day

00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:05.819
that that was, and then we come to the end of the chapter, and we see that Jesus of course

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:12.059
appears to his disciples as they're gathered together, and you come to the 21st chapter,

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:18.019
it's in that chapter in which it's Peter that says, I go a fishing, and they say unto him,

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:19.979
we also go with thee.

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:22.179
And Jesus is going to show up.

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:26.619
They're out there on the boat, and they're going to try to fish, and of course the Bible

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:29.539
says that they caught nothing.

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:34.739
If you have some time to study between this passage of Scripture and the previous record

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:40.139
in which there was the draft of fishes when Jesus told them after a night of toiling and

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:46.459
catching nothing, he says, cast out into the deep for a draft of fishes, and Peter says,

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:50.539
Lord we've toiled all the night, nevertheless at thy word, and he let down the net, there's

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:57.219
such a great catch, and here Jesus calls and says, have you caught anything?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.459
And they say, no, we've caught nothing.

00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:07.459
The Bible says here in verse number seven, well let me back up, because in verse number

00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:10.820
five it says, then Jesus saith unto them, children, have ye any meat?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.139
They answered him, no, they'd caught nothing.

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:18.619
Verse six, he said unto them, cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:20.019
find.

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:25.699
They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:36.059
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, it is the Lord.

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:39.339
Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his fisher's coat unto him

00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:42.099
for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea.

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:49.059
We find that a little while later after the Lord was speaking to Peter and asking Peter,

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:50.299
do you love me?

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:54.739
And going through that portion of Scripture, and Jesus tells him in verse 19 to follow

00:19:54.739 --> 00:20:00.059
me, and Peter in verse number 20, it says, then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:03.359
whom Jesus loved following."

00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:05.859
See, we could look at a number of other passages

00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:06.979
in the book of John,

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:08.819
but not only was John confident,

00:20:08.819 --> 00:20:10.099
but the other disciples.

00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:11.719
I mean, Mary Magdalene goeth to Him

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:14.219
that the Lord loveth.

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:18.899
And we find that John had this confidence,

00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:21.659
this assurance of God's love for him.

00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:23.739
I believe this morning that Paul

00:20:23.739 --> 00:20:26.219
was confident that Jesus loved him.

00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:28.579
In fact, we find that often Paul would preach

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:30.819
about the love of Christ.

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:32.659
Often, as he would minister to those

00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:34.619
that God would give him the opportunity

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:35.619
to minister to,

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:38.019
he would speak about the great love

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.899
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:41.619
The love of God.

00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:46.179
In Galatians 2, oftentimes we will recite

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:47.619
this verse of Scripture

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:50.139
and speak about the importance of living

00:20:50.139 --> 00:20:53.299
the crucified life, if you will,

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:55.099
and understanding that we have

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:56.379
been bought with a price

00:20:56.379 --> 00:20:57.779
and we're to glorify our Father

00:20:57.779 --> 00:20:58.699
who is in heaven.

00:20:58.699 --> 00:21:00.219
And we find that Paul,

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:03.019
as he would make this declaration here

00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:05.540
to the believers in the region of Galatia,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.579
he says this in Galatians 2,

00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.299
I am crucified with Christ.

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:12.699
Nevertheless, I live.

00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:15.939
Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:17.819
And the life which I now live in the flesh,

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:20.860
I live by the faith of the Son of God

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.659
who loved me.

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:25.099
Who loved me.

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:29.579
And gave Himself for me.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.099
What did John say in 1 John 3

00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:32.259
and verse 16?

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:36.579
Hereby perceive we the love of God,

00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:40.979
because He laid down His life for us.

00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:42.819
And Paul says here in Galatians 2

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.579
and verse 20 that He loved me

00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:48.939
and gave Himself for me.

00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:51.379
In the book of Ephesians in chapter 2,

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:53.339
Paul is beginning the passage

00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:56.500
speaking about the condition of all mankind

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.259
being lost,

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:01.860
being separated from God

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.979
because of our sin.

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:07.699
Being dead in our trespasses and sins.

00:22:07.699 --> 00:22:09.099
But you notice in Ephesians 2

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:11.819
and verse 4,

00:22:11.819 --> 00:22:13.419
the Bible begins with these two words,

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:15.139
but God.

00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:16.580
But God,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.179
who is rich in mercy,

00:22:19.179 --> 00:22:20.300
notice this,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.940
that His great love

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.220
wherewith He loved us.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.860
I believe this morning

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.179
that we need to be confident of God's love for us.

00:22:31.179 --> 00:22:34.139
I believe this morning that

00:22:34.139 --> 00:22:37.380
John was confident that Jesus loved him.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.059
I believe this morning that Paul was confident

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.179
that Jesus loved him.

00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:43.220
I wonder this morning,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.020
how confident are we

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.020
that God loves us?

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.899
Are there times in which we doubt

00:22:49.899 --> 00:22:51.539
the love of God?

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:53.619
Are there times in which

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:58.020
we are lacking that certainty?

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.220
I believe this morning that we need to be confident.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.699
Remember, that word that John uses,

00:23:02.699 --> 00:23:04.059
hereby perceive,

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:06.139
it means to know or understand,

00:23:06.139 --> 00:23:07.500
to have knowledge of,

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.139
and it lends itself to being confident of something

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.580
because I know it

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.259
and I can have assurance of it.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:15.300
I can be confident of it.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.860
I wonder this morning as we think about

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.819
the Apostle Paul preaching about the love of God.

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:22.339
Certainly, he was convinced

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:25.139
and he was confident in this truth.

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:28.500
Thus, he proclaimed the message.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.779
And what a great message it is.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:32.699
I want to go over to the book of John

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:35.459
in the 11th chapter.

00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:37.059
As we think about this really

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:38.139
as a first point,

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:40.779
but almost we can look at it as an introduction

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:42.339
because I want to look at the

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.300
really, we can't look at the entire passage

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.380
for sake of time,

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.419
but I want to look at John 11.

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:50.259
And if I were to give some outline points,

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:51.940
if you will, to the message this morning,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.899
I'd say number one,

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:56.539
that we're to be confident of the love of God for us.

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:59.979
But then I'd say this, number two,

00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:03.339
never allow circumstances

00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:07.940
to cause you to doubt the love of God.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.779
Never allow circumstances

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:14.739
to cause you to doubt the love of God.

00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:15.860
You understand this morning

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.260
that the enemy wants you to doubt the love of God.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.820
He does.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.540
The enemy wants you to look at your circumstances

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.019
and look at the things that are taking place in your life

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:28.540
and perhaps some hardships that you're dealing with,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.179
perhaps some adversities that you're facing in life.

00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:34.980
And the enemy wants to whisper in your ear,

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.220
God doesn't really love you.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.500
Because if God really loved you,

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.820
He wouldn't do this, that, or the other.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.339
But we need to this morning,

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:50.059
see, we're confident of God's love,

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:53.820
and we need to never allow circumstances

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.980
to cause us to doubt that love.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.700
What God has declared,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.700
what God has demonstrated,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.980
we can't let doubt creep in

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.859
and overcome what has been declared in the Word of God.

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:11.179
We see in John 11,

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:15.100
the reality is this passage of Scripture

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.459
is a really exciting passage of Scripture.

00:25:17.459 --> 00:25:19.739
It's in this passage

00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:22.019
that Jesus stands at the tomb of Lazarus

00:25:22.019 --> 00:25:24.899
and says, Lazarus, come forth!

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:27.419
I mean, what a powerful passage of Scripture

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.859
is John 11.

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:32.220
But I want you to notice some things

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.940
in this passage that I hope will help us.

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:39.940
Because we find that we are to be confident

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.220
of the love of God,

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.579
but we find that there are times

00:25:43.579 --> 00:25:46.579
in which our circumstances can be adverse.

00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:49.779
There are times in which we deal with hardships in life.

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:52.980
And here in John 11, I want you to notice,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.339
the Bible tells us about Lazarus being sick.

00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:59.019
And notice in v. 3,

00:25:59.019 --> 00:25:59.940
it says this,

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.299
therefore his sisters,

00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:03.700
we know those are Mary and Martha,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.779
the sisters of Lazarus,

00:26:05.779 --> 00:26:08.139
and they are going to send to Jesus,

00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:10.459
if we understand what's taking place here,

00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:11.540
in v. 2, it says,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.660
it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment,

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.019
wiped His feet with her hair,

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:16.899
whose brother Lazarus was sick.

00:26:16.899 --> 00:26:18.500
And so, Mary and Martha,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.100
the sisters of Lazarus,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.820
they sent unto Him.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.419
Him is Jesus,

00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:26.019
we understand as it begins saying this,

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:27.739
Lord.

00:26:27.739 --> 00:26:29.459
And so they send to Jesus,

00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:32.100
and I want you to notice what they say.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.899
Behold,

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:39.820
He whom thou lovest is sick.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.139
Now, could they not have just said,

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:47.940
Lazarus is sick?

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.859
Right?

00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:52.100
In fact, they could have simply said,

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.339
our brother is sick.

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:56.500
Jesus knew who it was.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.619
Jesus knew the family.

00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:01.859
But when they send to Jesus,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.540
I love the expression.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.339
They say, Lord,

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:07.859
behold,

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:13.100
He whom thou lovest is sick.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.940
Now I believe, without being able to go through

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.579
the entire passage of Scripture this morning,

00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:22.619
that Mary and Martha probably had the thought

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:24.980
that because Jesus loved Him,

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.299
that Jesus was going to come and heal Him.

00:27:28.299 --> 00:27:30.739
Because when Jesus arrives,

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.899
the first response of Martha and Mary

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:37.820
is that if you had been here,

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.579
He would not die.

00:27:39.579 --> 00:27:41.299
Look at it and you can read the whole passage

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:43.179
and you can see that.

00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:46.820
And so I believe that in their mind,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.700
they understood who Jesus was.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.339
No doubt they had heard of and seen miracles.

00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:54.100
They knew what He was capable of doing,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.980
for they expressed, they say,

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.540
if thou hadst been here,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.980
my brother had not died.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.459
What does that communicate to us?

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.220
That Jesus could have healed him.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.739
So when they send to the Lord,

00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:08.779
they say, Lord,

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:10.179
behold,

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:14.179
He whom thou lovest is sick.

00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:16.820
And then the Bible tells us in v. 4,

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.299
when Jesus heard that, He said,

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.779
this sickness is not unto death,

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:22.500
but for the glory of God,

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.660
the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.179
Notice v. 5.

00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:32.619
Now, Jesus loved Martha and her sister.

00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:36.140
That's Mary and Lazarus.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.179
It's interesting as I look at the passage of Scripture,

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:41.580
that Mary and Martha were confident

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.260
that Jesus loved Lazarus.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.260
No doubt.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.940
He whom thou lovest is sick.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.739
They knew, they understood,

00:28:48.739 --> 00:28:52.299
they had confidence that Jesus loved their brother.

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:54.539
And then we find in v. 5

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:56.940
that the Word of God reveals to us

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:04.820
that Jesus indeed did love Mary and Martha and Lazarus.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.260
We understand there are times in which we can quote John 3.16

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.099
and we can speak about the fact that God so loved the world,

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:14.739
but when we really take and make it personal

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:19.099
that God loves me as an individual.

00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:20.779
He knows everything about you.

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:23.500
He knows everything about me and He still loves me.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.059
And He still loves you.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:27.099
Isn't that amazing?

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.700
It's amazing.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.299
Those things that perhaps you'd hope

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:34.779
that no one else ever knew about you.

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:36.179
He knows.

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.619
And He still loves you.

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:43.419
Here, the confidence of the sisters,

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:45.380
Mary and Martha,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.500
that Jesus loved and then the declaration

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.219
where the Bible tells us that Jesus did love them.

00:29:51.219 --> 00:29:54.619
We understand that personally.

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:56.179
We find that as you would continue

00:29:56.179 --> 00:30:00.059
to walk through the passage of Scripture,

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:01.939
Jesus would say,

00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:04.279
look in v. 6 before He makes this statement,

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:06.899
when He had heard therefore that He was sick,

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:10.919
He abode two days still in the same place

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:13.699
where He was.

00:30:13.699 --> 00:30:16.379
Now what would you desire?

00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:21.219
An immediate departure.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.019
You are not looking for a divine delay.

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:25.859
You're looking for an immediate departure.

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:27.219
Amen?

00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:30.519
From Jesus two days.

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:32.619
It wasn't that He didn't receive the message.

00:30:32.619 --> 00:30:34.899
It wasn't that He didn't know what was going on.

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:36.879
It's that He's God.

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.379
And He says, I have a plan.

00:30:38.379 --> 00:30:39.419
I have a purpose.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:43.059
I'm going to accomplish something here.

00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:45.279
We find that after this delay,

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.299
it says that He said to His disciples,

00:30:47.299 --> 00:30:49.539
let us go into Judea again.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:51.899
And the disciples of course were concerned

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:54.059
because the Jews had sought to stone Him

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:55.659
and so on and so forth.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:57.299
And we understand that if you go

00:30:57.299 --> 00:30:58.819
through the entire book of John,

00:30:58.819 --> 00:31:00.099
His hour was not yet come,

00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:02.299
though it's not said specifically here.

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:04.299
But we know that when His hour was come,

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:07.139
that He would lay down His life.

00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:10.299
But notice in v. 11,

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:11.419
these things said He,

00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:14.180
and after that He saith unto them,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.019
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth.

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:21.659
But I go that I may awake him out of sleep.

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:23.419
The Bible says that His disciples said,

00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:26.099
If he sleep, he shall do well.

00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:27.739
I mean, we heard that He was sick too.

00:31:27.739 --> 00:31:29.899
And oftentimes, somebody says if you're sick,

00:31:29.899 --> 00:31:32.540
get some rest.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.619
And Jesus speaks plainly to them.

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:35.979
They did not understand

00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:37.860
what Jesus was communicating to them.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.979
And the Bible says in v. 13,

00:31:39.979 --> 00:31:41.899
Howbeit Jesus spake of His death,

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:43.500
but they thought that He had spoken

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.979
of taking rest and sleep.

00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:46.860
And then Jesus said unto them plainly

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.619
in v. 14, Lazarus is dead.

00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:54.500
Lazarus is dead.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.099
And in v. 15,

00:31:58.099 --> 00:31:59.659
I cannot develop all of this.

00:31:59.659 --> 00:32:01.899
I've preached from this passage of Scripture before

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:04.659
and focused more upon the truth of v. 15

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:06.259
than I have upon the love

00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:08.380
that we're focusing on this morning.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.059
We find in v. 15, the Bible says,

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:14.580
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.979
I was glad for your sakes that I was not there.

00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:23.979
For the intent ye may believe.

00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:28.419
Nevertheless, let us go unto Him.

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:30.539
You know, there are some times in your life,

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:32.539
there are some times in my life,

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:34.459
there's a situation that's recorded here

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:38.940
in the lives of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.979
in which God is seeking to do something great.

00:32:42.979 --> 00:32:44.739
And He's seeking to stretch us

00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:48.819
and grow us and develop us.

00:32:48.819 --> 00:32:50.500
And in those circumstances,

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.419
because of our human nature,

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:55.619
we can sometimes feel isolated.

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:57.779
Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed.

00:32:57.779 --> 00:32:59.419
And we can come to the place

00:32:59.419 --> 00:33:01.699
where the enemy at that moment

00:33:01.699 --> 00:33:05.339
will come and say,

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:09.899
Jesus doesn't really love you.

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:12.899
We believe this morning He can do anything.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.059
He could heal this man from a distance.

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:17.979
He could have immediately went.

00:33:17.979 --> 00:33:21.220
He could have prevented this.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.699
But you understand this morning

00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:25.539
that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:28.779
that it wasn't because He didn't love them.

00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:31.339
He's trying to develop them.

00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:34.300
If you'd been here,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.979
you wouldn't have died.

00:33:35.979 --> 00:33:37.940
Fast forward, if you will,

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.580
to the passage of Scripture

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.660
in v. 32,

00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:43.419
when Mary was come where Jesus was

00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:44.580
and saw Him,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.020
she fell down on His feet saying unto Him,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.179
Lord, if Thou hadst been here,

00:33:47.179 --> 00:33:48.179
my brother had not died.

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:50.220
The same words that Martha spoke earlier

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.419
in the passage of Scripture.

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:53.020
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.139
and the Jews also weeping

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:55.300
which came with her,

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.099
He groaned in the Spirit and was troubled.

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:58.419
Those Jews that were there,

00:33:58.419 --> 00:34:00.259
it was a very custom, cultural thing

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:01.300
that would take place.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.459
The death of a loved one

00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:03.619
where some folks would come

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:04.860
and they would be the mourners.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.419
And they would weep and mourn

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:07.459
and so on and so forth.

00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:09.300
And the Bible says in v. 34

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.259
that Jesus said,

00:34:10.259 --> 00:34:11.380
where have you laid Him?

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:12.259
And they said unto Him,

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:13.500
Lord, come and see.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.859
And then the Bible says here in v. 35,

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:19.700
Jesus wept.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.459
Jesus wept.

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:25.059
And then the Bible says this in v. 36,

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:27.220
Then said the Jews,

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.500
these mourners that were there,

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.779
Behold, how He loved Him.

00:34:33.779 --> 00:34:37.899
Behold, how He loved Him.

00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:39.019
And this morning,

00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:42.299
the truth of God's love

00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:44.019
and being confident of God's love

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:45.339
will bring us to a place

00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:46.779
where we're never going to allow

00:34:46.779 --> 00:34:48.059
circumstances to cause us

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:50.299
to doubt the love of God.

00:34:50.299 --> 00:34:52.779
Because I'm confident that God has declared

00:34:52.779 --> 00:34:53.859
and He's demonstrated,

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:56.260
hereby perceive we the love of God

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.179
because He laid down His life for us.

00:35:00.179 --> 00:35:02.179
And we find here in the passage of Scripture

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:03.739
that there were some of those Jews

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.179
that also said in v. 37,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.660
Could not this man,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.139
speaking of Jesus,

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:11.660
which opened the eyes of the blind,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.059
and you would look back in John 9

00:35:14.059 --> 00:35:15.859
and see that great miracle.

00:35:15.859 --> 00:35:16.820
And the Bible says,

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.019
have caused that even this man

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:22.579
should not have died.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.179
Even these Jews that were mourning,

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:25.619
they acknowledged the love

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:28.100
that Jesus had for this man Lazarus,

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.700
but they also acknowledged the fact

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.660
that Jesus could have prevented his death.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.019
But remember what He said back

00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:39.779
in the 15th verse,

00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:42.299
I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there

00:35:42.299 --> 00:35:46.019
to the intent you may believe.

00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:49.820
Jesus will stand at that tomb.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.660
And He says, take ye away the stone.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.779
In v. 39.

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.940
Of course, there's an objection.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.339
He hath been dead for four days

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:02.660
and surely by now he stinketh.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.059
Jesus said, roll back that stone.

00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:09.500
In v. 43, it says,

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.700
when He thus had spoken,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.940
He cried with a loud voice,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.700
Lazarus, come forth.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.739
Lazarus, come forth.

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:23.500
And the Bible says,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.660
he that was dead came forth,

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.059
bound hand and foot with grave clothes.

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:29.100
And his face was bound about with a napkin.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.100
Jesus saith unto them,

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.540
loose him and let him go.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.339
And I want you to notice in v. 45,

00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:36.419
the Bible begins with this word, then.

00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:37.940
Then.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.299
Then.

00:36:39.299 --> 00:36:41.619
Many of the Jews which came to Mary

00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:44.260
and had seen the things which Jesus did,

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.459
what's it say?

00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:47.739
Believed on Him.

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:52.380
Believed on Him.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.260
Then.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.859
They already believed that He could heal them.

00:36:57.859 --> 00:36:59.380
Martha believed it.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.779
Mary believed it.

00:37:00.779 --> 00:37:04.019
The Jews believed it.

00:37:04.019 --> 00:37:08.579
But because of that divine delay of Jesus,

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:10.339
now He's dead for four days

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:13.540
and He calls Him forth out of the grave.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.380
Then they believed

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.820
because they saw this great miracle.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.940
Remember, the Bible said in v. 4

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.660
that this sickness is not unto death

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.859
but for the glory of God

00:37:23.859 --> 00:37:26.339
that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:29.220
In John 9, the passage that deals with the blind man

00:37:30.179 --> 00:37:31.260
that was healed,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.139
the Bible says that the disciples asked Him,

00:37:33.139 --> 00:37:34.779
saying, Master, who did sin?

00:37:34.779 --> 00:37:36.739
This man or his parents who was born blind?

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:38.579
And Jesus said neither hath this man sinned

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:39.579
nor his parents,

00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:40.980
but that the works of God

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.739
should be made manifest in him

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:46.419
so that God would be glorified.

00:37:46.419 --> 00:37:48.500
And we find in this passage of Scripture

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.059
that the Bible begins

00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:55.899
as this particular event, if you will,

00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.220
is recorded for us.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.220
It begins by Mary and Martha

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.700
sending to Jesus and saying,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:09.059
Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.

00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:12.260
And then the Bible says a couple of verses later

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.700
that Jesus loved Martha and her sister

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.059
and Lazarus.

00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:22.380
Even the Jews that were there as mourners,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.260
they say, behold, how He loved him.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.500
You know, it's very possible that a circumstance like this

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.380
could cause someone to doubt the love of God.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.419
It could.

00:38:35.419 --> 00:38:38.859
Because the enemy wants you to doubt the love of God anyway.

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:40.700
The enemy wants you to doubt everything that God said.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.900
How do we know that?

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.539
Yea, hath God said.

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:47.179
Is that not how it started in the garden

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:49.299
in Genesis chapter number three?

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:50.140
Right?

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.260
Yea, hath God said.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.020
Why is it that people struggle

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.700
with their confidence of their salvation?

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.779
Because people want to doubt.

00:38:59.779 --> 00:39:02.260
Because the enemy wants to cause someone to doubt

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.099
what God said.

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:04.219
I don't know who it was.

00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:05.340
I don't remember.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.020
But a theologian of yesteryear said,

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.460
never put a question mark where God put a period.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.500
I like that.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.419
It's a simple statement.

00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:16.179
But how true.

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:21.179
Listen, this morning, circumstances will change.

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:24.700
Circumstances will change.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.940
Have you found it to be so?

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.700
Circumstances change.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.020
Sometimes you feel like life is a roller coaster.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.859
Right?

00:39:32.859 --> 00:39:35.099
And oftentimes when you're up at the top

00:39:35.099 --> 00:39:36.099
and things are going great

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:38.580
and you're on the mountaintop, so to speak,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.099
and man, the blessings are flowing

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:42.219
and it seems like everything's going well,

00:39:42.219 --> 00:39:44.900
typically at that time the enemy doesn't come whispering,

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.020
saying, God doesn't love you.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.779
Oh man, because you ain't going to doubt God's love

00:39:48.779 --> 00:39:51.500
when things are going wonderful.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.340
But it's when that valley comes into play.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.979
That roller coaster, if you will,

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:00.779
I hate roller coasters, by the way.

00:40:00.779 --> 00:40:07.619
way, but that roller coaster, so to speak, comes down. I have to take Advil before I

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:12.999
go into the theme park, and then I take some with me so that later on I can take some more.

00:40:12.999 --> 00:40:20.019
But the reality is that when you're in that valley, when those circumstances are challenging,

00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:27.139
when it seems like everything's falling apart, when it feels like no one's near and no one

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:37.459
cares, the enemy's going to come. The enemy's going to say, you still think God loves you?

00:40:37.459 --> 00:40:44.979
You still think that? Oh, be confident of it. Never allow circumstances to cause you

00:40:44.979 --> 00:40:52.539
to doubt the love of God. Never put a question mark where God has put a period. Hereby perceive

00:40:52.539 --> 00:41:01.219
we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us. It's settled. He loves you.

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:08.619
He loves me. Circumstances are going to change, but God's love remains constant. Circumstances

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:16.019
will change, but God's love remains constant. Romans 8, look there at that great passage,

00:41:16.019 --> 00:41:25.699
if you will. In Romans chapter number 8, Paul gives us a phenomenal declaration with

00:41:25.699 --> 00:41:41.179
regard to the love of God. I'll begin reading in verse number 31. The Bible says this in

00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:48.019
Romans 8 in verse number 31, what shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:55.699
who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,

00:41:55.699 --> 00:42:02.699
how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the

00:42:02.699 --> 00:42:08.259
charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is He that condemneth? It is Christ that

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:13.859
died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also

00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:23.139
maketh intercession for us. Look at this question in verse 35. Who shall separate us from the

00:42:23.139 --> 00:42:32.499
love of Christ? Those circumstances. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall

00:42:32.499 --> 00:42:49.139
it be tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

00:42:49.139 --> 00:42:58.059
Perhaps if we had time this morning to go through each one of those words that are mentioned,

00:42:58.059 --> 00:43:05.499
we could find how in those circumstances, someone might feel like they've been separated

00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:11.779
from the love of Christ. The enemy wants you to think that. As it is written in verse 36,

00:43:11.779 --> 00:43:15.499
so that's why Paul is going to give us an answer, for thy sake we are killed all the

00:43:15.499 --> 00:43:19.499
day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are

00:43:19.499 --> 00:43:26.699
more than conquerors, notice this, through Him that loved us. And then notice the language,

00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:32.059
for I am persuaded. Don't you like that word? I use the word confident in our message this

00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:37.579
morning as our points, and again that word has the idea of being fully persuaded, fully

00:43:37.579 --> 00:43:44.259
assured of, being positive, without suspicion, having an excess of assurance, and Paul says,

00:43:44.259 --> 00:43:53.579
for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor

00:43:53.579 --> 00:44:01.339
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:09.139
creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:19.019
our Lord. The question of verse number 35, who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:25.259
Paul gives an answer in verse 38 and 39, he says, I am persuaded, if I could summarize

00:44:25.259 --> 00:44:33.139
it, nothing, nothing, no other thing, no other creature, nothing can separate us from the

00:44:33.139 --> 00:44:41.179
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. This morning, when we're confident of

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:48.679
God's love for us individually, like John was, like Paul was, when we have that confidence

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:56.199
that God loves us, that we are fully persuaded and assured of, that we have that excess of

00:44:56.199 --> 00:45:01.919
assurance that, as John said, hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His

00:45:01.919 --> 00:45:08.119
life for us. When I'm confident of God's love, I'm probably going to share that message

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:17.239
with more people, because I'm confident of it. Amen? If you're doubting it, if you're

00:45:17.239 --> 00:45:20.239
not even sure that God loves you, you probably ain't going to tell anybody else that God

00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:28.639
loves them. Right? Anyone ever ask you for a recommendation for dinner? I want to go

00:45:28.639 --> 00:45:32.999
to a place, you know, where would you recommend? I was thinking about, it's Valentine's Day,

00:45:32.999 --> 00:45:37.119
I was thinking about taking my wife to such and such place, and you've been there before,

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:42.719
and it was not very good. And what do you say? Well, I mean, maybe I'd go somewhere

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:50.479
else. You know, I don't know that I would go there. Why? Because you're not persuaded,

00:45:50.479 --> 00:45:54.519
you're not confident yourself. So you're not going to make the recommendation that somebody

00:45:54.519 --> 00:46:00.559
else goes there. But if you've been there, man, that was the best fill-in-the-blank I've

00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:07.599
ever had. I mean, the steak there, the chicken parmesan, wherever you're going, it was great.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:17.479
See, this morning when I am convinced of God's love for me, and I'm assured that what He's

00:46:17.479 --> 00:46:23.079
done for me, He could do for others. Listen, our God is no respecter of persons. The Bible

00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:30.199
plainly teaches us that. He's no respecter of persons. And I can go, and I've had, I

00:46:30.199 --> 00:46:36.279
know I've shared already, I had more people this week, I had two, one on Friday, one yesterday,

00:46:36.279 --> 00:46:43.919
and I said, man, I like your mask. Jesus loves you. I hate wearing that thing. I really

00:46:43.919 --> 00:46:50.479
do. I don't like wearing a mask. I wear it as little as I possibly have to. But if I'm

00:46:50.479 --> 00:46:53.959
going to have to go into an establishment and wear it, man, I want it to have a message

00:46:53.959 --> 00:47:02.559
that someone's going to read. I was at Costco on Friday. The lady at Costco, she's the cashier,

00:47:02.559 --> 00:47:07.399
and she's starting to help the fellow that's in line in front of me, and she looks back

00:47:07.399 --> 00:47:12.359
to just see if the lane there was filled up or whatever, and she saw my mask, and she

00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:16.639
stopped dead stream in what she was doing, forgot about the guy who was in front of her

00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:21.359
and said, I like your mask, where'd you get it? They probably won't let me wear it here,

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:25.679
but I'm going to wear it everywhere else. That's what she said to me. And the guy yesterday,

00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:32.079
said, man, I like your mask. See, I've had some opportunities to talk to people because

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:38.639
of that, but I can tell them that God loves them. I can tell them of the love of God.

00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:44.999
I'm confident in the truth. I'm confident. And we need to be careful never to allow circumstances

00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:50.719
to cause us to doubt the love of God. There's some circumstances that we can face that are

00:47:50.719 --> 00:48:00.359
just, from human perspective, very challenging. When the doctor says the diagnosis is fill

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:08.039
in the blank. When the employer says, I'm sorry, but you got to make some cuts. I mean,

00:48:08.039 --> 00:48:12.479
whatever the difficulty is, the reality is that there's something that can happen in

00:48:12.479 --> 00:48:17.359
your life that's a difficulty that for somebody else, it doesn't even really faze them. And

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:22.919
then something happens in your life that seems to crush you, that somebody else just, it

00:48:22.919 --> 00:48:29.079
is what it is. I mean, no big deal. We're all made up different. But when those circumstances

00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:34.919
that are adverse come, would you understand this morning that circumstances are going

00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:42.759
to change, but God's love is constant. There's nothing that can separate us from the love

00:48:42.759 --> 00:48:52.359
of God. As many today will celebrate this holiday, spend nearly $22 billion on cards

00:48:52.359 --> 00:48:59.399
and chocolate and flowers and whatever else. I hope this morning that we'd be reminded

00:48:59.399 --> 00:49:08.639
of the love of God. Jesus loves you. What a precious truth that we find in the Bible.

00:49:08.639 --> 00:49:13.199
We need to go through every day of our life, being confident of that. Maybe it'd be good

00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:20.599
to refer to ourselves like John did. The one that Jesus loves. Isn't that good? Because

00:49:20.919 --> 00:49:27.199
man, we're reminded every day and confident. God loves me. He loves me. Let's pray together.

00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:33.399
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. Simple message

00:49:33.399 --> 00:49:44.559
this morning, but your word is powerful. And I know how the enemy works. I know that the

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:55.239
enemy would like to cause the people of God to doubt the love of God. Especially when

00:49:55.239 --> 00:50:00.279
those circumstances are overwhelming, challenging, adverse.

00:50:00.279 --> 00:50:09.079
And God, I pray, even as we've picked through a little bit of John 11, would You help us

00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:12.819
to never doubt Your love.

00:50:12.819 --> 00:50:20.119
Never put a question mark where You put a period.

00:50:20.119 --> 00:50:22.399
We'd have that confidence, that full assurance.

00:50:22.399 --> 00:50:33.479
We thank You for the truth of Your Word that reveals to us the love that You have for us.

00:50:33.479 --> 00:50:40.119
I pray that if there'd be one that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, they've never

00:50:40.119 --> 00:50:48.099
fully understood this truth that God loves them.

00:50:48.099 --> 00:50:54.999
He demonstrated that love by sending His Son to die upon the cross of Calvary.

00:50:54.999 --> 00:51:04.339
God in flesh paid with His precious blood a debt that could in no other way be paid,

00:51:04.339 --> 00:51:05.819
that debt being sin.

00:51:05.819 --> 00:51:12.439
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict sinners, convince them of their sin of Christ's

00:51:12.439 --> 00:51:15.039
righteousness of judgment to come.

00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:19.519
For us as the people of God, would You encourage us this morning through this truth?

00:51:19.519 --> 00:51:23.359
Would You help us to, with confidence, declare this truth to others?

00:51:23.359 --> 00:51:27.399
I pray that You'd have Your will in way in these few moments of invitation, for it's

00:51:27.399 --> 00:51:29.259
in Christ's name we pray.

00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:29.759
Would You stand with us?
