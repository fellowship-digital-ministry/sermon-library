1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the book of Hosea, chapter number 2.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Before we get to the second chapter, I'm going to give some introduction here

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to the book of Hosea.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the question specifically is from the second chapter,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a reference in verse number 15 specifically.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But really, instead of just jumping right into that verse of Scripture,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
give a little bit of a background, if you will, to the book of Hosea.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I believe the book of Hosea is a fascinating book.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hosea was a prophet that had a long ministry

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and specifically he was ministering to Israel.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When we refer to Israel in that context, it's the ten tribes of the north.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He's ministering well after the divided kingdom.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And we find that after the divided kingdom,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
there's Israel to the north, Judah to the south.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And this man, Hosea, was called of the Lord to minister,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to prophesy to the ten northern tribes, the tribe of Israel.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We find that Hosea 1.1 provides for us the timing of his ministry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Bible says in Hosea 1, in verse number 1,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea, the son of Berei,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So God helps us understand who's reigning in Judah

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
during the time of Hosea's ministry,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
though his ministry is specifically predominantly to the northern tribes,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
not to Judah.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And then it tells us, and in the days of Jeroboam,

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the son of Joash, king of Israel.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, it's important that we understand the history that God provides us

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
in the book of 1 and 2 Kings.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of course, in 1 and 2 Chronicles as well, there are two Jeroboams.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is Jeroboam II.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is not the first Jeroboam,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
when it first had a divided kingdom of Jeroboam and Rehoboam.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But we find this is Jeroboam II,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and it's important that we understand that.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It tells us that he is the son of Joash.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's the king of Israel.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He, Jeroboam II, reigned for 41 years.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In 2 Kings, chapter number 14,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
maybe hold your place here in Hosea and turn over to 2 Kings 14

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
just for a moment, if you will, by way of introduction,

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
as we get kind of the background, if you will,

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for what's taking place during the ministry of Hosea.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In 2 Kings, chapter 14, in verses 23 through 29,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
God provides us with the record here of the time

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in which Jeroboam II is reigning in Israel.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Notice the Bible says in 2 Kings 14, in verse 23,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah,

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Samaria is the capital, if you will, of the northern tribes,

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
whereas Jerusalem would be the capital of Judah.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And it says that he reigned 40 in one year.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So notice in verse 24,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
By the way, every king of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
After the divided kingdom, you have, of course,

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Saul, David, and Solomon, a united kingdom for 120 years.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
After that, there's this divided kingdom.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's no good kings in Israel. Zero.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We find that in Judah, there are periods of time in which there are good kings.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In fact, there are seasons of revival.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And because of that, Judah is not taken captive

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
for about 115, 120 years after Israel was taken captive.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Israel, of course, taken captive by the Assyrians and Judah by the Babylonians.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And we find here that he did evil in the sight of the Lord.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Notice it says that he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, as it says it here, it helps us in verse 24

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to remember the fact that there are two with the name of Jeroboam.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it's interesting because the first one that is mentioned

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
at the end of verse 24, who's the son of Nebat,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it says, who made Israel to sin.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, remember, his reign, he was concerned that the people

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
were going to go back to Jerusalem, that they were going to go back to Judah.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was going to weaken his ability to be the king.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And so what did he do? Well, he instituted his own form of worship.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He made it convenient for the people.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, you don't have to go all the way to Jerusalem.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It was a counterfeit.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They set up in Dan these worship idolatrous situations there.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we find that throughout the book of 1 and 2 Kings,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
often you will read the phrase that he did,

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
speaking of whoever the king is, according to the sins of Jeroboam.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And you read that regularly.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And what it's referring to is go back to the first Jeroboam

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and read what he did, and they followed that pattern.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Notice in verse number 25,

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, understand that Jonah went to Nineveh.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What was Nineveh?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Nineveh is the capital of Assyria.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The Assyrians, they were the ones that eventually would come

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and take captive Israel.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But remember, Jonah goes in preaching a message of

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
in 40 days you're going to perish, you're going to be destroyed.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why? Because of their wickedness.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And they repent. There were several things that were taking place.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And here in verse 25, when it talks about he, Jeroboam II,

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
under the Sea of the Plain, this was a quote-unquote

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
positive thing with regard to the nation,

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
its borders, its boundaries, and that sort of thing.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So what is it doing?

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, it's giving the people of Israel some sense of security.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Some sense of we're okay.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, look at what's happened.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's restored the coast of Israel.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So these prophets that are prophesying judgment that's going to come,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
well, look, we've fortified this.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We've restored the coast of Israel.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And so it's an interesting situation there in verse 26.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter,

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven,

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So there was some positive that was taking place there.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now, it's not spiritually positive, but we see God's grace and God's mercy.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Verse 28, Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and all that he did in his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel,

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are they not written in the books of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We find that here as we look at this portion of Scripture in 2 Kings,

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it helps us to get a little bit of the background, if you will,

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
of what's happening during the time in which this man Hosea is prophesying

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to the northern tribes of the ten northern tribes we refer to as Israel.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, if you are interested in reading something

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that will help you kind of get just a broader understanding, if you will,

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
of what's taking place during the time.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hosea and the prophet Amos are contemporaries.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They're prophesying at the same time to the same people

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
during the same situation, and we find that both of those books,

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hosea and Amos, they're contemporaries,

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and it makes for good reading to read those two books together

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in order to see a broader picture, if you will.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now, we understand that here the Bible says back in Hosea chapter 1,

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
so we get the setting, we understand what's taking place

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
with regard to the time of the writing.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In verse number 2 it says,

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Notice the Bible says, And the Lord said to Hosea,

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Notice the end of verse number 2.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not going to deal with the first part of the verse so much

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
because of what's going on in the question tonight,

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
but we see that God gave Hosea this command.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hosea obeys the command.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It was an illustration that God was using to show

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the relationship between God and Israel

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and how Israel was treating God.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so we find at the end of verse number 2 it says,

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
For the land hath committed great whoredom,

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
departing from the Lord.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And so we find the indictment is given in verse number 2.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If Israel was guilty, I would refer to it as being spiritual adultery

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and God's judgment would soon come.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
However, we find that God loves His people

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and we understand that God made a covenant with Abraham

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and that that covenant will be fulfilled.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I say all of that so that we could understand

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
as we get into the second chapter

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and deal specifically with the question this evening,

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it's important for us to have this understanding

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
of what's taking place,

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
who's being ministered to,

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
what the context of this particular promise is in chapter number 2.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And so we find that the Bible says that the land hath committed great whoredom.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The land itself, the dirt, can't commit great whoredom.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was the people of Israel.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They had been given the truth.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They had been given the truth with regard to the one and only God.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,960
only God, and they consistently and regularly were guilty of idolatry.

172
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,960
It was over and over and over again.

173
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:19,239
You find the idolatry not only of Israel, but of Judah as well, and we find that here

174
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:26,239
God says that he's going to bring judgment because of their wickedness.

175
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:31,200
Now let me say this, as you hold your place here in the book of Hosea, understand this

176
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,200
evening that God's people still today can be guilty of spiritual adultery, and the chastening

177
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
of the Lord is sure.

178
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,439
Hold your place here and look at the book of James, if you will, and keep your fingers

179
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,439
busy tonight.

180
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,479
We're going to look at several passages of Scripture as we seek to make application as

181
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:55,759
we go through this portion of Hosea this evening.

182
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:05,239
In James chapter number 4, the Bible tells us in verse number 4, I hear some pages, I'll

183
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,239
give you a moment.

184
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:12,800
James 4 and verse number 4, you adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship

185
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
of the world is enmity with God?

186
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,760
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

187
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,519
That's pretty strong language.

188
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,959
That's God's Word.

189
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,760
Very straight, very clear.

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,360
And so we find this evening that just as Israel, and so often we can criticize Israel, but

191
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,839
if we're not careful we can also imitate their behavior, and we can be guilty as James says

192
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,360
ye adulterers and adulteresses, and we find he says, and John says this in 1 John 2, love

193
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,040
not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

194
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,959
We know that the Bible says that the world passeth away, and we understand that truth,

195
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,599
but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

196
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:11,160
And so we find here this evening that this sin, if you will, this idolatry, this spiritual

197
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,279
adultery, this whoredom that's referred to here, he says that these individuals, they

198
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
are guilty, and because of their guilt they would face judgment.

199
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,240
By the way, we find that in the Pentateuch, as you study throughout the instruction that

200
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,880
God gives to his people Israel, God made it abundantly clear that if you do this, here's

201
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,179
the blessing.

202
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:37,919
If you do this, here's the judgment.

203
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:44,240
I mean, over and over we find that God made it crystal clear to his people, we dealt with

204
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,679
it a little bit in Sunday school this morning, about the choices.

205
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:54,479
The consequences to your choices and to my choices are not always known, but our choices

206
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,559
always have consequences.

207
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,679
At times, however, the consequences of our choices are crystal clear, and God says I

208
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,800
have a blessing for you, and I set before you a blessing and a curse.

209
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,039
A blessing if you obey, a curse if you disobey.

210
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,500
And we find this evening that the children of Israel were guilty, and therefore they

211
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,899
would face judgment, but I'm thankful that our God is long-suffering, I'm thankful that

212
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,020
our God is merciful, I'm thankful that our God is loving, and we look at that here in

213
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,380
this portion of Scripture.

214
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,979
Here's the question that was posed in Hosea chapter 2.

215
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:35,339
The question reads this way, what is the meaning of the valley of Achor for a door of hope

216
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,339
in Hosea 2 and verse number 15?

217
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,039
We'll begin reading with me in verse 14, we're going to look at the context here as we've

218
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,080
already dealt with the introduction, kind of understand the setting, look at verse 14

219
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
if you will.

220
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,320
The Bible says in Hosea 2 and verse 14, therefore behold, I will allure her and bring her into

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her.

222
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,320
And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope.

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,919
And she shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came

224
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,240
up out of the land of Egypt.

225
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,080
And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call

226
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,760
me no more Bally.

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,839
For I will take away the names of Balaam out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered

228
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,339
by their name.

229
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,799
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beast of the field, and with

230
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,839
the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground.

231
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,799
And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make

232
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,119
them to lie down safely.

233
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:43,720
And I will betroth thee unto me forever, yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,

234
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,239
and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.

235
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:53,480
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shalt know the Lord.

236
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,640
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens,

237
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,480
and they shall hear the earth.

238
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and they shall hear Jezreel.

239
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,720
And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not

240
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,799
obtained mercy.

241
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,119
And I will say to them which were not my people, thou art my people, and they shall say, Thou

242
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,519
art my God.

243
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,359
As we look at this text of Scripture, there are several things that are important for

244
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:28,239
us to know as we seek to answer the question, what is the meaning of the Valley of Achor

245
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,200
for Dor of Hope?

246
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,320
There's some interesting statements that are made, some insightful statements that are

247
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,519
made that help us to understand what the promise is here in Hosea chapter number two.

248
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,519
Number one, I want you to notice this, and it's not really points, it's just more of

249
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,260
a lecture type of a message this evening, but let me give you something to note down

250
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,260
there in your notes.

251
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,920
I want you to notice the phrase, that day.

252
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,920
You see it in verse 16, you see it in verse 18, and you see it again in verse 21.

253
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,480
So three times in this passage of Scripture, God speaks about that day.

254
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,320
Notice in verse 16, it says, it shall be at that day.

255
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,679
In verse number 18, it says, and in that day.

256
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,540
And then in verse number 21, it says, and it shall come to pass in that day.

257
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,920
And so we find that as we look here at this truth at that day, and notice that phraseology

258
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,200
repeated, it gives us insight to be able to understand this promise, the Valley of Achor

259
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,720
for Dor of Hope.

260
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,239
Now understand in verse number 17, it talks about removing idolatry.

261
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,920
The nation of Israel and idolatrous people, by the way, they're still in rebellion to

262
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,600
God as a nation, and we find here that we look and it says, I will take away the names

263
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,160
of Balaam out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

264
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,040
I mean, this removal of idolatry in verse 19, it talks about God's faithful love, though

265
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,880
his people had been disobedient and rebellious.

266
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,040
It talks about in loving kindness.

267
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm so thankful for that word, loving kindness.

268
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,320
It's repeated throughout the Old Testament over and over and over.

269
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,040
You find in verse 16, God gives us this truth with regard to these two names.

270
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,760
He says that thou shalt call me Ishi, and that means husband, and no longer Balaam.

271
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,000
That means owner or Lord.

272
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,640
Not Lord, the big capital L, but like the master, the owner in that general sense.

273
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,440
And so think about what God is saying, the relationship.

274
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:46,519
It's going to be this situation of no longer an owner, a master, but like a husband.

275
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,320
And again, understanding the context of what God said to Hosea to go and take thee a wife

276
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
of whoredoms.

277
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,519
And in fact, I preached on this.

278
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,760
That was a question that was asked in another Ask the Pastor.

279
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,880
Why did God have Hosea do that?

280
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,839
Go back and listen to that message, and that's the whole content of that message, not the

281
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,799
content of this message based on this specific question.

282
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,760
But we find that God gave that instruction to Hosea again as an example of what was going

283
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,519
on in Israel.

284
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,279
So we find that the Bible says in that day.

285
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,519
Now keep that in mind, and we're going to get to some more about that in just a moment

286
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,839
as we seek to answer the question more deeply.

287
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,719
Now Achor, as it talks about in verse number 15, the valley of Achor.

288
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,719
What is this?

289
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,760
Is this a familiar place?

290
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,320
Is this something that would be known?

291
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,880
Well, absolutely.

292
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,280
Achor, it means trouble or disturbance.

293
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,679
And we understand that this is the valley where Achan and his family were stoned, alright?

294
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,400
So this is something that was well known to the children of Israel as a place, as a location.

295
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,679
And when you would speak of the valley of Achor, it would immediately be in their mind

296
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,880
that this was a place of trouble or disturbance because of the history, because of what took

297
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,960
place.

298
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,880
And we find that that would immediately come to their mind.

299
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,280
Achor, even as the Chronicles tell us that Achan is the troubler of Israel.

300
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,840
Turn back to Joshua chapter 7, if you will.

301
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,440
I want to remind you of the context of this, and in fact, many of us this evening that

302
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,200
are not native, we're not Israelites, we're not Jewish, but we understand the Old Testament,

303
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
the accounts, and we're familiar with Achan.

304
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,640
We're familiar with the situation at Ai, and we understand what happens.

305
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
What did he do?

306
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,840
Well, he was guilty of taking the accursed thing, taking that which he was not to take,

307
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,799
that which was to be given to the Lord.

308
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,320
And we find that in chapter 7, they suffer defeat, and 36 men lose their lives, and Joshua's

309
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
beside himself.

310
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,840
He doesn't know what's going on.

311
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
And God says,

312
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,760
Sin in the camp.

313
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,360
And this is amazing to me

314
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,700
that God says this in v. 12,

315
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,260
"...therefore the children of Israel

316
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,900
could not stand before their enemies,

317
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,000
but turned their backs before their enemies."

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,560
Why? Because they were accursed.

319
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,800
"...Neither will I be with you anymore,

320
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,600
except you destroy the accursed from among you."

321
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,700
God is serious about sin.

322
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,260
You think you can live in sin

323
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,700
and have the blessing of God.

324
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
You're foolish.

325
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,840
God is long-suffering.

326
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
God is gracious. God is merciful.

327
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,560
But understand with me this evening

328
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,200
that God is just.

329
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,120
Amen? God is just.

330
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,840
And we find here that through a series of events,

331
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,200
we find that God brings the tribes

332
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,040
before Joshua, then the families,

333
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,200
then the households, then man by man.

334
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,080
And I can't imagine being Achan.

335
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
He knew that He had taken the accursed thing

336
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
and as it was narrowing down

337
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,480
and the circle is getting smaller

338
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
and smaller and smaller,

339
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,820
and He's going to be exposed.

340
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,860
The Bible says that in verse number 20,

341
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,380
that Achan answered Joshua and said,

342
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,780
indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel

343
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,660
and thus and thus have I done.

344
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,860
We find that the Bible tells us,

345
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm going to just skip through

346
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,140
so that we can get to the phraseology.

347
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,220
But in verse number 25, Joshua said,

348
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,340
why hast thou troubled us?

349
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,140
The Lord shall trouble thee this day

350
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,980
and all Israel stoned him with stones

351
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,180
and burned them with fire

352
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,060
after they had stoned them with stones

353
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,400
and they raised over him a great heap of stones

354
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,880
unto this day.

355
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,500
So the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger.

356
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,980
Wherefore, the name of that place was called

357
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,480
the Valley of Achor.

358
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,360
Notice it says unto this day.

359
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,620
Now, when you read that in the book of Joshua,

360
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,640
I read that today in 2024,

361
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,400
it doesn't mean until this day

362
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,080
that that heap of stones is still there unto today.

363
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,920
But what it means is under the time of the writing.

364
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,880
All right, so that heap of stones,

365
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,020
just like the memorials that we read of

366
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,340
in the beginning of the book of Joshua,

367
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,220
when he said they're here unto this day,

368
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,320
you could literally still go to Gilgal

369
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,380
and see the memorial that was set up.

370
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,160
You could literally still go to the place

371
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,900
where they crossed over Jericho.

372
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
There was that, that evidence was there

373
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,060
unto the day of the writing.

374
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,380
And so we find where it says

375
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,580
the Valley of Achor unto this day.

376
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,820
Again, this is well known to the children of Israel.

377
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,100
It was a place of trouble and judgment.

378
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
But as we find in Hosea chapter number two,

379
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,720
the Bible says in all of this indictment

380
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,760
and all of this wickedness and the spiritual adultery,

381
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,120
the judgment that would come,

382
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,840
God says the Valley of Achor for a door of hope,

383
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,560
for a door of hope.

384
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,340
Now, though judgment would come and judgment was certain

385
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,680
and though judgment had come to Achan

386
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,560
and therefore it had the name,

387
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,260
that valley named the Valley of Achor,

388
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,320
we know that the Bible says here in verse number 15,

389
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,160
that one day that Valley of Achor

390
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,240
would be known as a door of hope.

391
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,800
Now, hope is an interesting word.

392
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,080
Hope is a word that I like.

393
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,880
The word hope biblically means a confident expectation,

394
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,460
something that we can be sure of,

395
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,280
something that we can rest in,

396
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,960
something that we can have that confidence in,

397
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,920
that confident expectation.

398
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,800
And I want you to think about this just for a moment

399
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,540
and then I'm gonna get back to Hosea chapter number two,

400
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,300
but I wanna take just a little bit of a detour,

401
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,140
if you will, and talk about hope just for a moment,

402
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,100
because the Bible says that the Valley of Achor

403
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,940
for a door of hope.

404
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
And I want you to think about

405
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,940
if I could make an application this evening for us

406
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,180
with this idea of judgment and hope.

407
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,420
Can I do that with you this evening?

408
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,340
Take your Bibles and go to Ephesians chapter number two

409
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,980
and I want you to see what the Bible says

410
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,380
in Ephesians chapter number two.

411
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,020
As we think about our own selves

412
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,660
and here in the book of Hosea,

413
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,100
obviously we're dealing with the nation of Israel,

414
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,700
but I want you to think about ourselves

415
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,220
and I want you to think about the truth

416
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,340
that we were dead in our trespasses and sins

417
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,180
before we were saved by the grace of God, amen.

418
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,740
And I want you to understand that the Bible tells us

419
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,060
here in Ephesians chapter number two,

420
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,340
notice in verse number 11,

421
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,500
wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles

422
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,540
in the flesh who are called uncircumcision

423
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,660
by that which is called the circumcision

424
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,420
in the flesh made by hands.

425
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,980
Now that's obviously the distinction

426
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,500
between the Jews and the Gentiles,

427
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,020
the uncircumcision and the circumcision.

428
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,460
But notice in verse number 12,

429
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,660
it says that at that time ye were without Christ.

430
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,540
Do you remember when you were without Christ?

431
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,780
I hope you do.

432
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,140
I remember when I was without Christ.

433
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,820
I remember when I was lost.

434
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,900
And notice what the Bible says,

435
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,940
being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel

436
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,460
and strangers from the covenants of promise,

437
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,140
what does it say?

438
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Having no hope and without God in the world.

439
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,420
Do you remember when you had no hope?

440
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,060
You didn't have the confident expectation

441
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,900
that heaven was your home.

442
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,100
You didn't have that sweet assurance,

443
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,260
that blessed assurance that we sing of,

444
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,860
knowing that I am his and he is mine.

445
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,820
We had no hope, no hope.

446
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,700
But I want you to understand that in Christ no longer,

447
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,980
it says in verse number 13,

448
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,020
but now in Christ Jesus,

449
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,380
ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh how

450
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,060
by the blood of Christ for he is our peace.

451
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,340
And I'm so thankful for that,

452
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,940
but I want you to keep this idea of hope.

453
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,540
And we find in Ephesians chapter two,

454
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,340
it says that we had no hope.

455
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,020
Turn to the book of first Peter, if you will.

456
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,620
First Peter, and I want you to see what God tells us here

457
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,820
as Peter is writing to those that are facing great levels

458
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,740
of persecution under the hand of Nero,

459
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,060
the ruthless, wicked emperor of Rome,

460
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,940
hated God's people.

461
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,060
We find that as they're scattered abroad

462
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,100
that Peter is used of the Lord to write to them,

463
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,140
to encourage them.

464
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,460
We find in verse number three, notice what the Bible says.

465
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,060
Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

466
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,460
which according to his abundant mercy

467
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,180
hath begotten us again unto a what?

468
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,140
Lively hope.

469
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,020
By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

470
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,780
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

471
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,380
and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you

472
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,260
who are kept by the power of God through faith

473
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,940
and to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

474
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,220
I went from having no hope to having a lively hope.

475
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,420
Isn't that amazing?

476
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,100
No hope, lively hope.

477
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,780
Because of what Christ did on that cruel cross

478
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,060
and the offer of salvation, the gift of God,

479
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,620
which is eternal life.

480
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,020
But I want you to consider a third thought this evening

481
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,740
with regard to this subject of hope.

482
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,620
Turn to the book of Titus, if you will,

483
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,100
and chapter number two.

484
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,980
As believers, no longer are we in that position

485
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,580
of having no hope.

486
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,860
However, I would submit to you

487
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,740
that there are countless billions of people

488
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,860
on planet Earth today that have no hope,

489
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,180
that are in that condition of Ephesians two in verse 12,

490
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,540
they're without Christ and therefore they have no hope.

491
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,260
We have a lively hope.

492
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,700
We don't only have a lively hope,

493
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,140
but I want you to see what the Bible says

494
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,980
in verse number 11 of Titus two.

495
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,180
It says this, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation

496
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
hath appeared to all men,

497
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,060
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,

498
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,140
we should live soberly, righteously and godly

499
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,700
in this present world, looking for that blessed hope

500
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,500
and glorious appearing of the great God

501
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,860
and our Savior, Jesus Christ.

502
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,620
I have a lively hope, but I have a blessed hope.

503
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,780
Amen, aren't you thankful for that?

504
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,300
And I think about what God has done for us.

505
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,340
I think about how God in his grace and his mercy,

506
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,260
that he is our peace and that he took an individual.

507
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,620
If I use myself as the example this evening,

508
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,260
he took a lost sinner that had no hope

509
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,540
and he saved my soul and he gave me a lively hope

510
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,460
and I now have the blessed hope that one day

511
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,340
my Lord is gonna come back.

512
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,700
It's absolutely phenomenal.

513
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,980
And it's important that we think about that this evening.

514
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,900
God placed it upon my heart as I was preparing

515
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,460
to answer the question this evening

516
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,260
and just rejoicing in my preparation of yes,

517
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,059
looking at what's going on with Israel here in Hosea two

518
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,660
and the promise, but then thinking about my own life

519
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
and that I had no hope and he says,

520
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,980
the Valley of Achor, a place of trouble,

521
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,740
a place of disturbance, a place that was known for judgment

522
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,820
would be a door of hope.

523
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,820
I'm thankful that God, Jesus Christ took the judgment

524
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,900
for me and for you.

525
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,140
Did he not?

526
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,140
He hung upon that cruel cross and he suffered

527
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,180
and he bled and he died so that those who had no hope

528
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,059
could have a lively hope, could have the blessed hope

529
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,580
that one day our God's coming back

530
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,020
to receive us unto himself.

531
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,820
What a blessing that is.

532
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,420
Back to the portion of scripture here in the book of Hosea,

533
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,700
notice what a great promise this is

534
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,460
for the nation of Israel.

535
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,059
We understand, however, that this promise

536
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,500
is still in the future.

537
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,220
Israel as a nation is still in a state of disobedience

538
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,820
and rebellion, we understand that, we see that,

539
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,860
we understand that the Bible teaches us

540
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,940
that because of their rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ,

541
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,860
blindness, spiritual blindness has come upon

542
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,100
the nation of Israel.

543
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,580
Now it is possible that Jewish people can be saved,

544
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,140
but they have to be saved the same way as anyone else.

545
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,020
Listen, it is heresy, there are people

546
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,860
that are internet preachers, that are famous television preachers that say if you are Jewish

547
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,140
you're going to heaven, period.

548
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
That is false.

549
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,300
That is not what the Bible teaches whatsoever.

550
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,860
The Bible says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth

551
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,820
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

552
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,940
He came to his own, but his own received him not.

553
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,340
They cried out, crucify him.

554
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,100
Is that not what happened?

555
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,100
And we find that because of their rejection, they're in this state of disobedience.

556
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,760
There's this spiritual blindness that has happened to them, but there are still promises

557
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,460
that were made to Israel and those promises are as certain as they've ever been.

558
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,020
And we understand the full picture from God's perspective.

559
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,980
We're living in time and sometimes that's the difficulty is that we're living within

560
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,020
the boundaries of time and what's going on and it's hard for us sometimes to take that

561
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,680
step back and try to get the perspective of God.

562
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,220
Understand I said it this morning that this prophecy that is still going to be fulfilled

563
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,060
is already 2,700 years old.

564
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:21,380
This man Hosea was, listen, the nation of Israel was taken captive in 722 B.C.

565
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,140
The prophecy took place before the captivity.

566
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,380
Jeroboam is reigning.

567
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,140
Jeroboam did not enter into the captivity.

568
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,840
It was his descendants that were taken captive.

569
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,260
It was not Jeroboam.

570
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:39,420
So it's at least 2,700 years old plus however long it was prior to the captivity or prior

571
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,980
to the death of Jeroboam.

572
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,700
So we understand that, but the reality is that God's promises are sure.

573
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,860
We sang this morning, standing on the promises of Christ my King, right?

574
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,980
We sing and we thank God for the promises and we come to a passage like this and we

575
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,820
say, well what does this mean?

576
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,460
When is this going to be fulfilled?

577
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,320
What is the meaning of this?

578
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,500
The valley of Achor, this place of judgment, this place of trouble and of disturbance is

579
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,700
going to be a door of hope?

580
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,500
When is this going to happen?

581
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
How is this going to happen?

582
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,460
Is it going to happen?

583
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,220
And let me say this, it is absolutely going to happen.

584
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
Why?

585
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,660
Because God said so.

586
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,420
Now you can fight with God, but I'm going to tell you like Gamaliel said to those Sanhedrin

587
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,780
leaders in Acts chapter number 5, if this thing be of God, you're wasting your time.

588
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,740
You might as well just submit to God and understand that God has a plan, amen?

589
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,220
And God's plan is perfect.

590
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,220
God's plan is perfect.

591
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,420
You say, I don't like God's plan, you've got to change your perspective, amen?

592
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,380
Some of you laugh, I'm being serious.

593
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,940
You know how many people say it's not fair that the person in Africa, the person in Australia,

594
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:06,100
the person in Asia, the person in North America, South America, wherever, up in the barren

595
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,980
cold wilderness of the northern territories, they've never heard of Jesus and I can't believe

596
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,940
that they would go to hell.

597
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,740
Well, what are you doing about it?

598
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,020
You know how many people I've heard make that, and I can't believe, how could a loving God,

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,700
well, He commanded us to go to hell.

600
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,900
So all of a sudden we're bringing a charge against God while we're being disobedient

601
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
to God.

602
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,140
How does that work?

603
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,860
That's a messed up mindset, is it not?

604
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,340
So what we find here in the text of Scripture is that it will happen.

605
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,860
I believe we can understand when it's going to happen.

606
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:52,220
The key, as I said early on in the message this evening, is that phrase, that day.

607
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,020
That day.

608
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
That day.

609
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,860
It's repeated three times in just a short period of time here in these verses, and what

610
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
does it mean?

611
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,580
In verse 16, 18, and 21, what is it that's being referred to?

612
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,620
What does God mean when He says at that day, in that day, at that day?

613
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,780
So let me help us, and we don't have time to develop all of this this evening, but let

614
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,780
me tell you of two phrases that you'll find throughout the Bible.

615
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,260
You hear this phrase, the day of Christ and the day of the Lord, all right?

616
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,140
Those are phrases that you're going to come across as you study the Scriptures, as you

617
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,660
read the Scriptures, and both of those, day of Christ and day of the Lord, they're really

618
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,340
referring to the same period of time.

619
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,300
The seven-year period of tribulation is what that's referring to.

620
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,740
The day of Christ is really concerning itself with the heavenly events, whereas in the day

621
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,140
of the Lord is concerning itself with the earthly events.

622
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,460
So there are going to be things that are taking place on earth during the seven-year tribulation,

623
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,300
the day of the Lord, while at the same time, there will be things, events taking place

624
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,700
in heaven, the day of Christ.

625
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,740
They're not two different time periods, they're the same time period, but they're referring

626
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,060
to events from a certain perspective.

627
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,260
Heavenly events, earthly events.

628
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:15,460
I want you to remember that the seven-year tribulation is referred to as Jacob's trouble.

629
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,500
So what is God going to do?

630
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,180
Well, Israel is in rebellion.

631
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:27,420
Israel is in rebellion to God to this very day as a nation, they are in rebellion to

632
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,780
God to this very day, and therefore they're having spiritual blindness, the judgment,

633
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,940
so on and so forth.

634
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,420
But during the tribulation, all of a sudden what's going to happen is God is going to

635
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,900
once again deal with Israel primarily.

636
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,420
That's His plan.

637
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:50,580
So the church is going to be raptured because God's no longer dealing with us as the church.

638
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,380
We've been saved, and He's going to deliver us from that wrath and all of those things.

639
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,140
And by the way, we're going to study the book of Revelation, but I've heard many people

640
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,020
say, well, I believe in a mid-trib rapture because it's pre-wrath.

641
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,500
Have you ever read Revelation 6?

642
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,820
I mean, as soon as the seals begin to get open, the wrath of God is being poured out.

643
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,020
And if you read that as being not wrathful, I'm confused.

644
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:20,340
And so the reality this evening is that we look at and we see, what is the purpose of

645
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,860
the tribulation?

646
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,180
Why is there going to be a tribulation?

647
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,620
And it's for the nation of Israel.

648
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,980
You see the 144,000 witnesses, 12,000 from each tribe, the two witnesses that come.

649
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
What is God doing?

650
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,380
He's dealing with Israel.

651
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,940
He's calling them back to Himself.

652
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,140
You read in Romans where it says, and this is where people, the heresy comes in, where

653
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,420
it says that all Israel shall be saved.

654
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,660
That doesn't mean that every Jewish person is saved.

655
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:57,460
It means after the tribulation and all of what is going to happen, that at that point

656
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,420
when the millennial kingdom begins, all of Israel shall be saved.

657
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:08,700
Those that trusted in the true Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, because of the tribulation

658
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,320
and all that's taking place, all Israel shall be saved.

659
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,500
That's what it means.

660
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:21,660
And so we find that when we look here at, in that day, at that day, the repeated phraseology

661
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,820
in Hosea 2, when is it going to happen?

662
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,420
Well, the day of Christ, the day of the Lord, that seven-year period begins with the rapture

663
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,460
of the church.

664
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,980
The clock begins.

665
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,940
Three and a half years, I mean exactly three and a half years, the abomination of desolation

666
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,420
is going to take place, the midpoint of the tribulation.

667
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Daniel speaks about it.

668
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,660
Jesus speaks about it.

669
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,020
Paul speaks about it.

670
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,980
It's going to take place at that time, and we find that he's going to violate the peace

671
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,420
treaty, the Antichrist will, all of that stuff that's going to happen, and then there's going

672
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,260
to be three and a half more years.

673
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,580
Then there's going to be the battle of Armageddon.

674
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,120
Jesus is coming back.

675
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,180
He's coming back with his saints, hallelujah.

676
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,460
That's the next time, Samantha, I'm going to ride a horse, amen?

677
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,000
And hallelujah, I rode a horse down in Tennessee a few years ago, and we're planning a trip

678
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,360
to Tennessee tomorrow, and I said, one thing we're not doing is riding horses, amen?

679
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,600
I did not really enjoy myself too much, and it was not terrible, but it was not something

680
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,980
I'd like to do again, but I'm going to ride a horse when I come back with Jesus, amen?

681
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,820
And hallelujah, it's not going to kick me off.

682
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,860
It's not going to cause me trouble, and I rejoice in that, but the reality is that when

683
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,780
we come back, we find that Christ returns with his saints, and what does he do?

684
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,580
He establishes his millennial kingdom, the millennial reign of Christ.

685
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:48,619
It's a thousand years that Jesus Christ himself is going to sit on the throne of David.

686
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:54,220
He is the rightful heir to it, and he is going to rule and reign in righteousness.

687
00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:00,080
The Bible gives us so many insights to regard to the millennial reign of Christ, those which

688
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,739
we cannot look at this evening in their entirety, but I do want you to notice here in the text,

689
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:10,540
the text of Scripture that the Bible talks about in verse 15, how she shall sing there

690
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,220
as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt,

691
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:21,520
and you think about that imagery and the understanding of the hope and the joy that they would have

692
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,700
because of that.

693
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,080
He's going to remove idolatry in verse 17 and verse 18, and in that day will I make

694
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,300
a covenant for them with the beast of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with

695
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,700
the creeping things of the ground.

696
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,780
It's interesting.

697
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,660
God speaks about the way in which the bear and the lion and the lamb, excuse me, they're

698
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,500
going to be together, and that doesn't happen today, playing on the whole of the asp.

699
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,700
I'm not messing around with serpents today, man, especially deadly ones, venomous ones,

700
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:59,020
and you find that God's going to restore during that millennial reign really to the way it

701
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,660
was restored.

702
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,180
really pre-flood, pre-judgment.

703
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,540
Jesus is gonna rule and people will still die.

704
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,380
We're not gonna die

705
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,300
because we're gonna come back and rule and reign with him.

706
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,840
We've already gone through that situation,

707
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,860
either the rapture or death here.

708
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,420
But we find that here in Hosea,

709
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,740
it talks about the covenant that he's gonna make

710
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,620
with the beast of the field and all of that in verse 18.

711
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,780
In verse 19 and 20, he talks about that betrothal

712
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,140
and that relationship that he gave hint to

713
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,540
in verse number 16 with regard to the names

714
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,820
that not Bali, but Ishi.

715
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,180
And we find here that God gives this promise.

716
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,580
So when we read the book of Hosea,

717
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,960
we read all of the judgment,

718
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,860
we see all of the indictment that comes on Hosea,

719
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,220
excuse me, on the nation of Israel

720
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,340
through the prophet Hosea because of their idolatry,

721
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,820
because of their wickedness, their spiritual adultery.

722
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,260
We find that in the midst of the judgment,

723
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,380
the prophecy of judgment, the indictment upon the nation

724
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,900
that God gives them a promise.

725
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,920
The promise is not yet fulfilled,

726
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,060
but one day it will be that the Valley of Achor,

727
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,500
a place known, it's a place of judgment,

728
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,500
trouble, disturbance will be a door of hope.

729
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,460
And that's the promise that God gives to his people

730
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,300
in Hosea chapter number two.

731
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,700
And we find that that day will come.

732
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,820
We don't know exactly when it's gonna come,

733
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,660
but I'll say this, it's at least seven years away.

734
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,900
How do I know that?

735
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,420
Well, because we haven't started the tribulation yet.

736
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,860
The tribulation seven years.

737
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,580
And so it's at least seven years

738
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,820
before the millennial reign will begin.

739
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,300
And that's when the Valley of Achor

740
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,100
will be known as a door of hope.

741
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,020
I'm thankful this evening to have hope.

742
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,980
I had no hope one day.

743
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,620
Now I have a lively hope.

744
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,200
I have the blessed hope.

745
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,100
I hope this evening you have hope.

746
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,880
You have hope because you know Jesus.

747
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
Let's pray together.

748
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,660
Father, we love you.

749
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,760
We thank you for loving us.

750
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,220
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

751
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I pray God that you would help us to understand your plan.

752
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,980
Lord, no doubt we covered a lot of material this evening

753
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,060
and looked at a large swath of time.

754
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,140
God, we're thankful that you have a plan.

755
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,740
We're thankful that you're gracious, merciful God.

756
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,260
Lord, we're thankful for this promise

757
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,140
that you gave to Israel as a nation.

758
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,340
We're thankful for the reality that we have

759
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
as your people, as your children.

760
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,300
To have hope.

761
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,860
And God, I pray that you'd help us to live every day

762
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,780
with the understanding and the reminder

763
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,900
of that blessed hope that today could be the day

764
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,200
that you come back.

765
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,340
God, help us to be found faithful.

766
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,340
Help us to be found occupying, redeeming the time.

767
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,020
I pray, Father, that you'd help us to be encouraged

768
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,100
that you have a plan.

769
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,220
Help us, Lord, to submit to you.

770
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,660
We'll thank you for it, in Christ's name we pray.
