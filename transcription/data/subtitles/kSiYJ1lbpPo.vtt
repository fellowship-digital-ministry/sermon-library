WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the book of Hosea, chapter number 2.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Before we get to the second chapter, I'm going to give some introduction here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to the book of Hosea.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the question specifically is from the second chapter,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
a reference in verse number 15 specifically.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But really, instead of just jumping right into that verse of Scripture,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
give a little bit of a background, if you will, to the book of Hosea.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I believe the book of Hosea is a fascinating book.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hosea was a prophet that had a long ministry

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and specifically he was ministering to Israel.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When we refer to Israel in that context, it's the ten tribes of the north.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He's ministering well after the divided kingdom.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we find that after the divided kingdom,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
there's Israel to the north, Judah to the south.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And this man, Hosea, was called of the Lord to minister,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to prophesy to the ten northern tribes, the tribe of Israel.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We find that Hosea 1.1 provides for us the timing of his ministry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The Bible says in Hosea 1, in verse number 1,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea, the son of Berei,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So God helps us understand who's reigning in Judah

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
during the time of Hosea's ministry,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
though his ministry is specifically predominantly to the northern tribes,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
not to Judah.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And then it tells us, and in the days of Jeroboam,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the son of Joash, king of Israel.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, it's important that we understand the history that God provides us

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in the book of 1 and 2 Kings.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Of course, in 1 and 2 Chronicles as well, there are two Jeroboams.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This is Jeroboam II.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is not the first Jeroboam,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
when it first had a divided kingdom of Jeroboam and Rehoboam.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But we find this is Jeroboam II,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and it's important that we understand that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It tells us that he is the son of Joash.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He's the king of Israel.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
He, Jeroboam II, reigned for 41 years.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In 2 Kings, chapter number 14,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
maybe hold your place here in Hosea and turn over to 2 Kings 14

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
just for a moment, if you will, by way of introduction,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
as we get kind of the background, if you will,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for what's taking place during the ministry of Hosea.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In 2 Kings, chapter 14, in verses 23 through 29,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
God provides us with the record here of the time

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in which Jeroboam II is reigning in Israel.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Notice the Bible says in 2 Kings 14, in verse 23,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Samaria is the capital, if you will, of the northern tribes,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
whereas Jerusalem would be the capital of Judah.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And it says that he reigned 40 in one year.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So notice in verse 24,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
By the way, every king of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
After the divided kingdom, you have, of course,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Saul, David, and Solomon, a united kingdom for 120 years.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
After that, there's this divided kingdom.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
There's no good kings in Israel. Zero.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We find that in Judah, there are periods of time in which there are good kings.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In fact, there are seasons of revival.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And because of that, Judah is not taken captive

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for about 115, 120 years after Israel was taken captive.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Israel, of course, taken captive by the Assyrians and Judah by the Babylonians.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And we find here that he did evil in the sight of the Lord.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Notice it says that he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, as it says it here, it helps us in verse 24

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to remember the fact that there are two with the name of Jeroboam.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And it's interesting because the first one that is mentioned

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
at the end of verse 24, who's the son of Nebat,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it says, who made Israel to sin.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now, remember, his reign, he was concerned that the people

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
were going to go back to Jerusalem, that they were going to go back to Judah.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It was going to weaken his ability to be the king.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And so what did he do? Well, he instituted his own form of worship.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
He made it convenient for the people.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Oh, you don't have to go all the way to Jerusalem.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It was a counterfeit.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
They set up in Dan these worship idolatrous situations there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we find that throughout the book of 1 and 2 Kings,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
often you will read the phrase that he did,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
speaking of whoever the king is, according to the sins of Jeroboam.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And you read that regularly.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And what it's referring to is go back to the first Jeroboam

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and read what he did, and they followed that pattern.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Notice in verse number 25,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now, understand that Jonah went to Nineveh.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
What was Nineveh?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Nineveh is the capital of Assyria.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The Assyrians, they were the ones that eventually would come

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and take captive Israel.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But remember, Jonah goes in preaching a message of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in 40 days you're going to perish, you're going to be destroyed.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Why? Because of their wickedness.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And they repent. There were several things that were taking place.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And here in verse 25, when it talks about he, Jeroboam II,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
under the Sea of the Plain, this was a quote-unquote

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
positive thing with regard to the nation,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
its borders, its boundaries, and that sort of thing.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So what is it doing?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well, it's giving the people of Israel some sense of security.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Some sense of we're okay.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I mean, look at what's happened.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He's restored the coast of Israel.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So these prophets that are prophesying judgment that's going to come,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
well, look, we've fortified this.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We've restored the coast of Israel.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so it's an interesting situation there in verse 26.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So there was some positive that was taking place there.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Now, it's not spiritually positive, but we see God's grace and God's mercy.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Verse 28, Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and all that he did in his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
are they not written in the books of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We find that here as we look at this portion of Scripture in 2 Kings,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
it helps us to get a little bit of the background, if you will,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of what's happening during the time in which this man Hosea is prophesying

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to the northern tribes of the ten northern tribes we refer to as Israel.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now, if you are interested in reading something

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that will help you kind of get just a broader understanding, if you will,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
of what's taking place during the time.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Hosea and the prophet Amos are contemporaries.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
They're prophesying at the same time to the same people

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
during the same situation, and we find that both of those books,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Hosea and Amos, they're contemporaries,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and it makes for good reading to read those two books together

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in order to see a broader picture, if you will.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Now, we understand that here the Bible says back in Hosea chapter 1,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
so we get the setting, we understand what's taking place

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
with regard to the time of the writing.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
In verse number 2 it says,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Notice the Bible says, And the Lord said to Hosea,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Notice the end of verse number 2.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I'm not going to deal with the first part of the verse so much

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because of what's going on in the question tonight,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
but we see that God gave Hosea this command.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Hosea obeys the command.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
It was an illustration that God was using to show

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the relationship between God and Israel

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and how Israel was treating God.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And so we find at the end of verse number 2 it says,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
For the land hath committed great whoredom,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
departing from the Lord.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And so we find the indictment is given in verse number 2.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
If Israel was guilty, I would refer to it as being spiritual adultery

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and God's judgment would soon come.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
However, we find that God loves His people

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and we understand that God made a covenant with Abraham

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and that that covenant will be fulfilled.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I say all of that so that we could understand

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as we get into the second chapter

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and deal specifically with the question this evening,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it's important for us to have this understanding

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
of what's taking place,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
who's being ministered to,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
what the context of this particular promise is in chapter number 2.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And so we find that the Bible says that the land hath committed great whoredom.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The land itself, the dirt, can't commit great whoredom.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It was the people of Israel.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
They had been given the truth.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
They had been given the truth with regard to the one and only God.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.960
only God, and they consistently and regularly were guilty of idolatry.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.960
It was over and over and over again.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:19.239
You find the idolatry not only of Israel, but of Judah as well, and we find that here

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:26.239
God says that he's going to bring judgment because of their wickedness.

00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:31.200
Now let me say this, as you hold your place here in the book of Hosea, understand this

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:39.200
evening that God's people still today can be guilty of spiritual adultery, and the chastening

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.720
of the Lord is sure.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.439
Hold your place here and look at the book of James, if you will, and keep your fingers

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:47.439
busy tonight.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:51.479
We're going to look at several passages of Scripture as we seek to make application as

00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:55.759
we go through this portion of Hosea this evening.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:05.239
In James chapter number 4, the Bible tells us in verse number 4, I hear some pages, I'll

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.239
give you a moment.

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:12.800
James 4 and verse number 4, you adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.680
of the world is enmity with God?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.760
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.519
That's pretty strong language.

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.959
That's God's Word.

00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:33.760
Very straight, very clear.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.360
And so we find this evening that just as Israel, and so often we can criticize Israel, but

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.839
if we're not careful we can also imitate their behavior, and we can be guilty as James says

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:51.360
ye adulterers and adulteresses, and we find he says, and John says this in 1 John 2, love

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.040
not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.959
We know that the Bible says that the world passeth away, and we understand that truth,

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:04.599
but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:11.160
And so we find here this evening that this sin, if you will, this idolatry, this spiritual

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.279
adultery, this whoredom that's referred to here, he says that these individuals, they

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:22.399
are guilty, and because of their guilt they would face judgment.

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:27.240
By the way, we find that in the Pentateuch, as you study throughout the instruction that

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.880
God gives to his people Israel, God made it abundantly clear that if you do this, here's

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.179
the blessing.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:37.919
If you do this, here's the judgment.

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:44.240
I mean, over and over we find that God made it crystal clear to his people, we dealt with

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.679
it a little bit in Sunday school this morning, about the choices.

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:54.479
The consequences to your choices and to my choices are not always known, but our choices

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:56.559
always have consequences.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:01.679
At times, however, the consequences of our choices are crystal clear, and God says I

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:05.800
have a blessing for you, and I set before you a blessing and a curse.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.039
A blessing if you obey, a curse if you disobey.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:13.500
And we find this evening that the children of Israel were guilty, and therefore they

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:17.899
would face judgment, but I'm thankful that our God is long-suffering, I'm thankful that

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:23.020
our God is merciful, I'm thankful that our God is loving, and we look at that here in

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.380
this portion of Scripture.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.979
Here's the question that was posed in Hosea chapter 2.

00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:35.339
The question reads this way, what is the meaning of the valley of Achor for a door of hope

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.339
in Hosea 2 and verse number 15?

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:42.039
We'll begin reading with me in verse 14, we're going to look at the context here as we've

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:46.080
already dealt with the introduction, kind of understand the setting, look at verse 14

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080
if you will.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.320
The Bible says in Hosea 2 and verse 14, therefore behold, I will allure her and bring her into

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.320
the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.320
And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.919
And she shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:09.240
up out of the land of Egypt.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.080
And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.760
me no more Bally.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.839
For I will take away the names of Balaam out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.339
by their name.

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:28.799
And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beast of the field, and with

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:31.839
the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:35.799
And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:38.119
them to lie down safely.

00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:43.720
And I will betroth thee unto me forever, yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.239
and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.

00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:53.480
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shalt know the Lord.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.640
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.480
and they shall hear the earth.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.920
And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and they shall hear Jezreel.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.720
And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.799
obtained mercy.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:17.119
And I will say to them which were not my people, thou art my people, and they shall say, Thou

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:19.519
art my God.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.359
As we look at this text of Scripture, there are several things that are important for

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:28.239
us to know as we seek to answer the question, what is the meaning of the Valley of Achor

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.200
for Dor of Hope?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.320
There's some interesting statements that are made, some insightful statements that are

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:41.519
made that help us to understand what the promise is here in Hosea chapter number two.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:44.519
Number one, I want you to notice this, and it's not really points, it's just more of

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:49.260
a lecture type of a message this evening, but let me give you something to note down

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.260
there in your notes.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.920
I want you to notice the phrase, that day.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.920
You see it in verse 16, you see it in verse 18, and you see it again in verse 21.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.480
So three times in this passage of Scripture, God speaks about that day.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.320
Notice in verse 16, it says, it shall be at that day.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.679
In verse number 18, it says, and in that day.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.540
And then in verse number 21, it says, and it shall come to pass in that day.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:21.920
And so we find that as we look here at this truth at that day, and notice that phraseology

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:29.200
repeated, it gives us insight to be able to understand this promise, the Valley of Achor

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.720
for Dor of Hope.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.239
Now understand in verse number 17, it talks about removing idolatry.

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:38.920
The nation of Israel and idolatrous people, by the way, they're still in rebellion to

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.600
God as a nation, and we find here that we look and it says, I will take away the names

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.160
of Balaam out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.040
I mean, this removal of idolatry in verse 19, it talks about God's faithful love, though

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.880
his people had been disobedient and rebellious.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.040
It talks about in loving kindness.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.880
I'm so thankful for that word, loving kindness.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.320
It's repeated throughout the Old Testament over and over and over.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.040
You find in verse 16, God gives us this truth with regard to these two names.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:21.760
He says that thou shalt call me Ishi, and that means husband, and no longer Balaam.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.000
That means owner or Lord.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.640
Not Lord, the big capital L, but like the master, the owner in that general sense.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.440
And so think about what God is saying, the relationship.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:46.519
It's going to be this situation of no longer an owner, a master, but like a husband.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:52.320
And again, understanding the context of what God said to Hosea to go and take thee a wife

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320
of whoredoms.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.519
And in fact, I preached on this.

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:57.760
That was a question that was asked in another Ask the Pastor.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.880
Why did God have Hosea do that?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.839
Go back and listen to that message, and that's the whole content of that message, not the

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:06.799
content of this message based on this specific question.

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:13.760
But we find that God gave that instruction to Hosea again as an example of what was going

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.519
on in Israel.

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:18.279
So we find that the Bible says in that day.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:24.519
Now keep that in mind, and we're going to get to some more about that in just a moment

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:27.839
as we seek to answer the question more deeply.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:32.719
Now Achor, as it talks about in verse number 15, the valley of Achor.

00:18:32.719 --> 00:18:33.719
What is this?

00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:34.760
Is this a familiar place?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.320
Is this something that would be known?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.880
Well, absolutely.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.280
Achor, it means trouble or disturbance.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:48.679
And we understand that this is the valley where Achan and his family were stoned, alright?

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:55.400
So this is something that was well known to the children of Israel as a place, as a location.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.679
And when you would speak of the valley of Achor, it would immediately be in their mind

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:06.880
that this was a place of trouble or disturbance because of the history, because of what took

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.960
place.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.880
And we find that that would immediately come to their mind.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:18.280
Achor, even as the Chronicles tell us that Achan is the troubler of Israel.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.840
Turn back to Joshua chapter 7, if you will.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.440
I want to remind you of the context of this, and in fact, many of us this evening that

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:33.200
are not native, we're not Israelites, we're not Jewish, but we understand the Old Testament,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.520
the accounts, and we're familiar with Achan.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.640
We're familiar with the situation at Ai, and we understand what happens.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.640
What did he do?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.840
Well, he was guilty of taking the accursed thing, taking that which he was not to take,

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.799
that which was to be given to the Lord.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:56.320
And we find that in chapter 7, they suffer defeat, and 36 men lose their lives, and Joshua's

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320
beside himself.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.840
He doesn't know what's going on.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840
And God says,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.760
Sin in the camp.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.360
And this is amazing to me

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.700
that God says this in v. 12,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.260
"...therefore the children of Israel

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.900
could not stand before their enemies,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.000
but turned their backs before their enemies."

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.560
Why? Because they were accursed.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.800
"...Neither will I be with you anymore,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.600
except you destroy the accursed from among you."

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.700
God is serious about sin.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.260
You think you can live in sin

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.700
and have the blessing of God.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.700
You're foolish.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.840
God is long-suffering.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.760
God is gracious. God is merciful.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.560
But understand with me this evening

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.200
that God is just.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.120
Amen? God is just.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.840
And we find here that through a series of events,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.200
we find that God brings the tribes

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.040
before Joshua, then the families,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.200
then the households, then man by man.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.080
And I can't imagine being Achan.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.240
He knew that He had taken the accursed thing

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.640
and as it was narrowing down

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.480
and the circle is getting smaller

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.120
and smaller and smaller,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.820
and He's going to be exposed.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.860
The Bible says that in verse number 20,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.380
that Achan answered Joshua and said,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.780
indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.660
and thus and thus have I done.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.860
We find that the Bible tells us,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.980
I'm going to just skip through

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.140
so that we can get to the phraseology.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.220
But in verse number 25, Joshua said,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.340
why hast thou troubled us?

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.140
The Lord shall trouble thee this day

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.980
and all Israel stoned him with stones

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.180
and burned them with fire

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.060
after they had stoned them with stones

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.400
and they raised over him a great heap of stones

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.880
unto this day.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.500
So the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.980
Wherefore, the name of that place was called

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.480
the Valley of Achor.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.360
Notice it says unto this day.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.620
Now, when you read that in the book of Joshua,

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.640
I read that today in 2024,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.400
it doesn't mean until this day

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.080
that that heap of stones is still there unto today.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.920
But what it means is under the time of the writing.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.880
All right, so that heap of stones,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.020
just like the memorials that we read of

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.340
in the beginning of the book of Joshua,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.220
when he said they're here unto this day,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.320
you could literally still go to Gilgal

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.380
and see the memorial that was set up.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.160
You could literally still go to the place

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.900
where they crossed over Jericho.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.900
There was that, that evidence was there

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.060
unto the day of the writing.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.380
And so we find where it says

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.580
the Valley of Achor unto this day.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.820
Again, this is well known to the children of Israel.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.100
It was a place of trouble and judgment.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.000
But as we find in Hosea chapter number two,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.720
the Bible says in all of this indictment

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.760
and all of this wickedness and the spiritual adultery,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.120
the judgment that would come,

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.840
God says the Valley of Achor for a door of hope,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.560
for a door of hope.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.340
Now, though judgment would come and judgment was certain

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.680
and though judgment had come to Achan

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.560
and therefore it had the name,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.260
that valley named the Valley of Achor,

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.320
we know that the Bible says here in verse number 15,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.160
that one day that Valley of Achor

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.240
would be known as a door of hope.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.800
Now, hope is an interesting word.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.080
Hope is a word that I like.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.880
The word hope biblically means a confident expectation,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.460
something that we can be sure of,

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.280
something that we can rest in,

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.960
something that we can have that confidence in,

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.920
that confident expectation.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.800
And I want you to think about this just for a moment

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.540
and then I'm gonna get back to Hosea chapter number two,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.300
but I wanna take just a little bit of a detour,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.140
if you will, and talk about hope just for a moment,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.100
because the Bible says that the Valley of Achor

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.940
for a door of hope.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.940
And I want you to think about

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.940
if I could make an application this evening for us

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.180
with this idea of judgment and hope.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.420
Can I do that with you this evening?

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.340
Take your Bibles and go to Ephesians chapter number two

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.980
and I want you to see what the Bible says

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.380
in Ephesians chapter number two.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.020
As we think about our own selves

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.660
and here in the book of Hosea,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.100
obviously we're dealing with the nation of Israel,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.700
but I want you to think about ourselves

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.220
and I want you to think about the truth

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.340
that we were dead in our trespasses and sins

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.180
before we were saved by the grace of God, amen.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.740
And I want you to understand that the Bible tells us

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.060
here in Ephesians chapter number two,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.340
notice in verse number 11,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.500
wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.540
in the flesh who are called uncircumcision

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.660
by that which is called the circumcision

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.420
in the flesh made by hands.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.980
Now that's obviously the distinction

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.500
between the Jews and the Gentiles,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.020
the uncircumcision and the circumcision.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.460
But notice in verse number 12,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.660
it says that at that time ye were without Christ.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.540
Do you remember when you were without Christ?

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.780
I hope you do.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.140
I remember when I was without Christ.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.820
I remember when I was lost.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.900
And notice what the Bible says,

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.940
being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.460
and strangers from the covenants of promise,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.140
what does it say?

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.140
Having no hope and without God in the world.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.420
Do you remember when you had no hope?

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.060
You didn't have the confident expectation

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.900
that heaven was your home.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.100
You didn't have that sweet assurance,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.260
that blessed assurance that we sing of,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.860
knowing that I am his and he is mine.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.820
We had no hope, no hope.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.700
But I want you to understand that in Christ no longer,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.980
it says in verse number 13,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.020
but now in Christ Jesus,

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.380
ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh how

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.060
by the blood of Christ for he is our peace.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.340
And I'm so thankful for that,

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.940
but I want you to keep this idea of hope.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.540
And we find in Ephesians chapter two,

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.340
it says that we had no hope.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.020
Turn to the book of first Peter, if you will.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.620
First Peter, and I want you to see what God tells us here

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.820
as Peter is writing to those that are facing great levels

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.740
of persecution under the hand of Nero,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.060
the ruthless, wicked emperor of Rome,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.940
hated God's people.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.060
We find that as they're scattered abroad

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.100
that Peter is used of the Lord to write to them,

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.140
to encourage them.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.460
We find in verse number three, notice what the Bible says.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.060
Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.460
which according to his abundant mercy

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.180
hath begotten us again unto a what?

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.140
Lively hope.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.020
By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.780
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.380
and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.260
who are kept by the power of God through faith

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.940
and to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.220
I went from having no hope to having a lively hope.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.420
Isn't that amazing?

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.100
No hope, lively hope.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.780
Because of what Christ did on that cruel cross

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.060
and the offer of salvation, the gift of God,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.620
which is eternal life.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.020
But I want you to consider a third thought this evening

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.740
with regard to this subject of hope.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.620
Turn to the book of Titus, if you will,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.100
and chapter number two.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.980
As believers, no longer are we in that position

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.580
of having no hope.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.860
However, I would submit to you

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.740
that there are countless billions of people

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.860
on planet Earth today that have no hope,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.180
that are in that condition of Ephesians two in verse 12,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.540
they're without Christ and therefore they have no hope.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.260
We have a lively hope.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.700
We don't only have a lively hope,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.140
but I want you to see what the Bible says

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.980
in verse number 11 of Titus two.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.180
It says this, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.180
hath appeared to all men,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.060
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.140
we should live soberly, righteously and godly

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.700
in this present world, looking for that blessed hope

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.500
and glorious appearing of the great God

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.860
and our Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.620
I have a lively hope, but I have a blessed hope.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.780
Amen, aren't you thankful for that?

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.300
And I think about what God has done for us.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.340
I think about how God in his grace and his mercy,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.260
that he is our peace and that he took an individual.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.620
If I use myself as the example this evening,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.260
he took a lost sinner that had no hope

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.540
and he saved my soul and he gave me a lively hope

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.460
and I now have the blessed hope that one day

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.340
my Lord is gonna come back.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.700
It's absolutely phenomenal.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.980
And it's important that we think about that this evening.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.900
God placed it upon my heart as I was preparing

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.460
to answer the question this evening

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.260
and just rejoicing in my preparation of yes,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.059
looking at what's going on with Israel here in Hosea two

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.660
and the promise, but then thinking about my own life

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.180
and that I had no hope and he says,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.980
the Valley of Achor, a place of trouble,

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.740
a place of disturbance, a place that was known for judgment

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.820
would be a door of hope.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.820
I'm thankful that God, Jesus Christ took the judgment

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.900
for me and for you.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.140
Did he not?

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.140
He hung upon that cruel cross and he suffered

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.180
and he bled and he died so that those who had no hope

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.059
could have a lively hope, could have the blessed hope

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:17.580
that one day our God's coming back

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.020
to receive us unto himself.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.820
What a blessing that is.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.420
Back to the portion of scripture here in the book of Hosea,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.700
notice what a great promise this is

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.460
for the nation of Israel.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.059
We understand, however, that this promise

00:29:32.059 --> 00:29:34.500
is still in the future.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.220
Israel as a nation is still in a state of disobedience

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.820
and rebellion, we understand that, we see that,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.860
we understand that the Bible teaches us

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.940
that because of their rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.860
blindness, spiritual blindness has come upon

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.100
the nation of Israel.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.580
Now it is possible that Jewish people can be saved,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.140
but they have to be saved the same way as anyone else.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.020
Listen, it is heresy, there are people

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:05.860
that are internet preachers, that are famous television preachers that say if you are Jewish

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.140
you're going to heaven, period.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.140
That is false.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.300
That is not what the Bible teaches whatsoever.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.860
The Bible says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.820
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.940
He came to his own, but his own received him not.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.340
They cried out, crucify him.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.100
Is that not what happened?

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.100
And we find that because of their rejection, they're in this state of disobedience.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.760
There's this spiritual blindness that has happened to them, but there are still promises

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.460
that were made to Israel and those promises are as certain as they've ever been.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.020
And we understand the full picture from God's perspective.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.980
We're living in time and sometimes that's the difficulty is that we're living within

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.020
the boundaries of time and what's going on and it's hard for us sometimes to take that

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.680
step back and try to get the perspective of God.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.220
Understand I said it this morning that this prophecy that is still going to be fulfilled

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.060
is already 2,700 years old.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:21.380
This man Hosea was, listen, the nation of Israel was taken captive in 722 B.C.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.140
The prophecy took place before the captivity.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.380
Jeroboam is reigning.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.140
Jeroboam did not enter into the captivity.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.840
It was his descendants that were taken captive.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.260
It was not Jeroboam.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:39.420
So it's at least 2,700 years old plus however long it was prior to the captivity or prior

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.980
to the death of Jeroboam.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:47.700
So we understand that, but the reality is that God's promises are sure.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.860
We sang this morning, standing on the promises of Christ my King, right?

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.980
We sing and we thank God for the promises and we come to a passage like this and we

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.820
say, well what does this mean?

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.460
When is this going to be fulfilled?

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.320
What is the meaning of this?

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.500
The valley of Achor, this place of judgment, this place of trouble and of disturbance is

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.700
going to be a door of hope?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.500
When is this going to happen?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500
How is this going to happen?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.460
Is it going to happen?

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.220
And let me say this, it is absolutely going to happen.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.220
Why?

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.660
Because God said so.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.420
Now you can fight with God, but I'm going to tell you like Gamaliel said to those Sanhedrin

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:33.780
leaders in Acts chapter number 5, if this thing be of God, you're wasting your time.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.740
You might as well just submit to God and understand that God has a plan, amen?

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.220
And God's plan is perfect.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.220
God's plan is perfect.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.420
You say, I don't like God's plan, you've got to change your perspective, amen?

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.380
Some of you laugh, I'm being serious.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.940
You know how many people say it's not fair that the person in Africa, the person in Australia,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:06.100
the person in Asia, the person in North America, South America, wherever, up in the barren

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.980
cold wilderness of the northern territories, they've never heard of Jesus and I can't believe

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.940
that they would go to hell.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.740
Well, what are you doing about it?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:22.020
You know how many people I've heard make that, and I can't believe, how could a loving God,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.700
well, He commanded us to go to hell.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.900
So all of a sudden we're bringing a charge against God while we're being disobedient

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900
to God.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.140
How does that work?

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.860
That's a messed up mindset, is it not?

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:41.340
So what we find here in the text of Scripture is that it will happen.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.860
I believe we can understand when it's going to happen.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:52.220
The key, as I said early on in the message this evening, is that phrase, that day.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.020
That day.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.020
That day.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.860
It's repeated three times in just a short period of time here in these verses, and what

00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.860
does it mean?

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.580
In verse 16, 18, and 21, what is it that's being referred to?

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:08.620
What does God mean when He says at that day, in that day, at that day?

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.780
So let me help us, and we don't have time to develop all of this this evening, but let

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.780
me tell you of two phrases that you'll find throughout the Bible.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:21.260
You hear this phrase, the day of Christ and the day of the Lord, all right?

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.140
Those are phrases that you're going to come across as you study the Scriptures, as you

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.660
read the Scriptures, and both of those, day of Christ and day of the Lord, they're really

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.340
referring to the same period of time.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.300
The seven-year period of tribulation is what that's referring to.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.740
The day of Christ is really concerning itself with the heavenly events, whereas in the day

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:44.140
of the Lord is concerning itself with the earthly events.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.460
So there are going to be things that are taking place on earth during the seven-year tribulation,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.300
the day of the Lord, while at the same time, there will be things, events taking place

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.700
in heaven, the day of Christ.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.740
They're not two different time periods, they're the same time period, but they're referring

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.060
to events from a certain perspective.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.260
Heavenly events, earthly events.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:15.460
I want you to remember that the seven-year tribulation is referred to as Jacob's trouble.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.500
So what is God going to do?

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.180
Well, Israel is in rebellion.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:27.420
Israel is in rebellion to God to this very day as a nation, they are in rebellion to

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.780
God to this very day, and therefore they're having spiritual blindness, the judgment,

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:32.940
so on and so forth.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:38.420
But during the tribulation, all of a sudden what's going to happen is God is going to

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.900
once again deal with Israel primarily.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.420
That's His plan.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:50.580
So the church is going to be raptured because God's no longer dealing with us as the church.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:56.380
We've been saved, and He's going to deliver us from that wrath and all of those things.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.140
And by the way, we're going to study the book of Revelation, but I've heard many people

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.020
say, well, I believe in a mid-trib rapture because it's pre-wrath.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.500
Have you ever read Revelation 6?

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:10.820
I mean, as soon as the seals begin to get open, the wrath of God is being poured out.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.020
And if you read that as being not wrathful, I'm confused.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:20.340
And so the reality this evening is that we look at and we see, what is the purpose of

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.860
the tribulation?

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.180
Why is there going to be a tribulation?

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.620
And it's for the nation of Israel.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:32.980
You see the 144,000 witnesses, 12,000 from each tribe, the two witnesses that come.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.980
What is God doing?

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.380
He's dealing with Israel.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.940
He's calling them back to Himself.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:44.140
You read in Romans where it says, and this is where people, the heresy comes in, where

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.420
it says that all Israel shall be saved.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.660
That doesn't mean that every Jewish person is saved.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:57.460
It means after the tribulation and all of what is going to happen, that at that point

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.420
when the millennial kingdom begins, all of Israel shall be saved.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.700
Those that trusted in the true Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, because of the tribulation

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.320
and all that's taking place, all Israel shall be saved.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.500
That's what it means.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:21.660
And so we find that when we look here at, in that day, at that day, the repeated phraseology

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.820
in Hosea 2, when is it going to happen?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.420
Well, the day of Christ, the day of the Lord, that seven-year period begins with the rapture

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.460
of the church.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.980
The clock begins.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.940
Three and a half years, I mean exactly three and a half years, the abomination of desolation

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.420
is going to take place, the midpoint of the tribulation.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.420
Daniel speaks about it.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.660
Jesus speaks about it.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.020
Paul speaks about it.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.980
It's going to take place at that time, and we find that he's going to violate the peace

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.420
treaty, the Antichrist will, all of that stuff that's going to happen, and then there's going

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.260
to be three and a half more years.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.580
Then there's going to be the battle of Armageddon.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.120
Jesus is coming back.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.180
He's coming back with his saints, hallelujah.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.460
That's the next time, Samantha, I'm going to ride a horse, amen?

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.000
And hallelujah, I rode a horse down in Tennessee a few years ago, and we're planning a trip

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.360
to Tennessee tomorrow, and I said, one thing we're not doing is riding horses, amen?

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.600
I did not really enjoy myself too much, and it was not terrible, but it was not something

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.980
I'd like to do again, but I'm going to ride a horse when I come back with Jesus, amen?

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.820
And hallelujah, it's not going to kick me off.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.860
It's not going to cause me trouble, and I rejoice in that, but the reality is that when

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.780
we come back, we find that Christ returns with his saints, and what does he do?

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.580
He establishes his millennial kingdom, the millennial reign of Christ.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:48.619
It's a thousand years that Jesus Christ himself is going to sit on the throne of David.

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:54.220
He is the rightful heir to it, and he is going to rule and reign in righteousness.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:39:00.080
The Bible gives us so many insights to regard to the millennial reign of Christ, those which

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.739
we cannot look at this evening in their entirety, but I do want you to notice here in the text,

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:10.540
the text of Scripture that the Bible talks about in verse 15, how she shall sing there

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.220
as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt,

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.520
and you think about that imagery and the understanding of the hope and the joy that they would have

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.700
because of that.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.080
He's going to remove idolatry in verse 17 and verse 18, and in that day will I make

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.300
a covenant for them with the beast of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.700
the creeping things of the ground.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.780
It's interesting.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:39.660
God speaks about the way in which the bear and the lion and the lamb, excuse me, they're

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:46.500
going to be together, and that doesn't happen today, playing on the whole of the asp.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:52.700
I'm not messing around with serpents today, man, especially deadly ones, venomous ones,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:59.020
and you find that God's going to restore during that millennial reign really to the way it

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.660
was restored.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.180
really pre-flood, pre-judgment.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.540
Jesus is gonna rule and people will still die.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.380
We're not gonna die

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.300
because we're gonna come back and rule and reign with him.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.840
We've already gone through that situation,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.860
either the rapture or death here.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.420
But we find that here in Hosea,

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.740
it talks about the covenant that he's gonna make

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.620
with the beast of the field and all of that in verse 18.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.780
In verse 19 and 20, he talks about that betrothal

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.140
and that relationship that he gave hint to

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.540
in verse number 16 with regard to the names

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.820
that not Bali, but Ishi.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.180
And we find here that God gives this promise.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.580
So when we read the book of Hosea,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.960
we read all of the judgment,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.860
we see all of the indictment that comes on Hosea,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.220
excuse me, on the nation of Israel

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.340
through the prophet Hosea because of their idolatry,

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.820
because of their wickedness, their spiritual adultery.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.260
We find that in the midst of the judgment,

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.380
the prophecy of judgment, the indictment upon the nation

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.900
that God gives them a promise.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.920
The promise is not yet fulfilled,

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.060
but one day it will be that the Valley of Achor,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.500
a place known, it's a place of judgment,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.500
trouble, disturbance will be a door of hope.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.460
And that's the promise that God gives to his people

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.300
in Hosea chapter number two.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.700
And we find that that day will come.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.820
We don't know exactly when it's gonna come,

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.660
but I'll say this, it's at least seven years away.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.900
How do I know that?

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.420
Well, because we haven't started the tribulation yet.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.860
The tribulation seven years.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.580
And so it's at least seven years

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.820
before the millennial reign will begin.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.300
And that's when the Valley of Achor

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.100
will be known as a door of hope.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.020
I'm thankful this evening to have hope.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.980
I had no hope one day.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.620
Now I have a lively hope.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.200
I have the blessed hope.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.100
I hope this evening you have hope.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.880
You have hope because you know Jesus.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.920
Let's pray together.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.660
Father, we love you.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.760
We thank you for loving us.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.220
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760
I pray God that you would help us to understand your plan.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.980
Lord, no doubt we covered a lot of material this evening

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.060
and looked at a large swath of time.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.140
God, we're thankful that you have a plan.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.740
We're thankful that you're gracious, merciful God.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.260
Lord, we're thankful for this promise

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.140
that you gave to Israel as a nation.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.340
We're thankful for the reality that we have

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.340
as your people, as your children.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.300
To have hope.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.860
And God, I pray that you'd help us to live every day

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.780
with the understanding and the reminder

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.900
of that blessed hope that today could be the day

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.200
that you come back.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.340
God, help us to be found faithful.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.340
Help us to be found occupying, redeeming the time.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.020
I pray, Father, that you'd help us to be encouraged

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.100
that you have a plan.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.220
Help us, Lord, to submit to you.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.660
We'll thank you for it, in Christ's name we pray.
