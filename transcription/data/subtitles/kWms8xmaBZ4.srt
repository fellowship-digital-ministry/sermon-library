1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
second Kings chapter number eight as we continue studying the life of Elisha and

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,079
as we now move on into this eighth chapter of course we've spent several

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,880
weeks over the last several Wednesdays we've been in chapter number seven last

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,600
week we took a week off from the life of Elisha looked at a passage of scripture

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,399
with the life of Ezra and what a blessing that was and this evening as we

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,360
get into chapter number eight we will see once again that Elisha has an

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,599
interaction with the woman from Shunem and you'll remember this woman from

8
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:39,479
Shunem based on our study of second Kings chapter number four is several

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,240
really probably several months ago now when we studied the fourth chapter of

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,040
the book of second Kings and we dealt with the ministry of Elisha and how God

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,959
was working and of course he would pass through Shunem it would go through there

12
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:57,000
on a somewhat regular basis the Bible says that he passeth continually through

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,639
that place and so the woman at Shunem she spoke with her husband and she said

14
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:05,760
we need to make a little chamber and so they had a construction project and we

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
often refer to a prophet's chamber we use that terminology and we really see

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,760
that it comes from what we see here in second Kings chapter number four and

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,440
Elisha had testified of the care in which he received each time he would

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,199
pass through that place not only having a place in which to stay but also the

19
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:31,000
great care in which he received we find that the of course through the passage

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,360
of scriptures you interact with the lady at Shunem you find of course that they

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,919
had no children and Elisha announces that they'll have a son and what a

22
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:42,839
wonderful day that must have been they have a son and then he's out working

23
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:48,440
with his dad one day in the field and the boy dies and of course the woman

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,839
from Shunem there's no name given she goes to find the man of God and Elisha

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,680
sends Gehazi up ahead and long story short that boy is raised from the dead

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,360
and then we get into chapter 5 really the end of chapter 4 and 5 6 7 you

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,479
don't hear anything about Elisha having any interaction whatsoever with the lady

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,199
from the woman from Shunem and her family and now we come to chapter number

29
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,800
8 and the Bible says then spake Elisha unto the woman notice how it's referred

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,559
to here whose son he had restored to life so of course we know through the

31
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,960
description that is given here in verse number one as to the woman that God is

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,300
referring to that Elisha is going to have this interaction with of course as

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,759
I've mentioned there's been a number of events that have transpired over the

34
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,440
past a few chapters of dialogue that we read in the Word of God and we don't

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,520
know exactly how much time has passed not only from the last interaction to

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,639
this we don't know how much time passed between the end of chapter number 7 the

37
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,720
beginning of chapter number 8 we just know that the dialogue goes into this

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,039
interaction that is recorded here we do know that in just a few verses of

39
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,080
Scripture seven years of famine is covered and it's amazing how sometimes

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,919
you can read super lengthy portions of Scripture and there's just a brief

41
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,800
amount of time that passes and other times there's just a couple of verses

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,520
and several years can pass and so we find that the Bible says then spake

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,679
thou in thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn notice

45
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:34,759
for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land

46
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,559
seven years if you're taking notes this evening the Lord hath called for a

47
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:45,279
famine that is the title for the message adopted right from verse number one for

48
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:50,960
the Lord hath called for a famine it's interesting in the Word of God as you

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,839
often will find references to God's of course judgment upon his people and you

50
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:03,399
find that in the Word of God periods of famine most what most times are

51
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:08,279
representative of divine judgment periods of drought you remember we first

52
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:13,080
find Elijah we first began to study in first Kings chapter number 17 to the

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,079
life of Elijah what do you see he's calling for that drought right there's

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,399
not going to be neither rain nor dew except at my word and we find that three

55
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,320
and a half years passed and why it was the wickedness of Ahab and Jezebel and

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,480
we find that as we move here into the life of Elisha and we have some

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,279
understanding of the the the reign of Jehoram and his wickedness and we find

58
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,079
that the Bible tells us that he cleaved under the sins of Jeroboam the son of

59
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,239
Nebat and of course we dealt with many of those things but we find that here as

60
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:52,880
we enter into the eighth chapter of the book of 2nd Kings that once again there

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,920
is divine judgment upon the house of Israel because of their wickedness I'm

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,679
thankful that our God is righteous and that he is the righteous judge and we

63
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:10,160
find that he in righteousness indeed executes judgment and we find that he's

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
given truth throughout the entirety of the Word of God with regard to his hand

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,559
of blessing and his time of judgment the reality is that most of us I think if

66
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:24,000
all of us are in our right minds we would say that we would much rather have

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,440
times of blessing than times of judgment amen and but we find that the

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,720
blessing comes as a result of obedience and honoring the Lord and so we find

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,279
here that as we look at the passage of scripture I want you to see the

70
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,380
declaration of Elisha the declaration really recorded for us in the first two

71
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,279
verses here of chapter number eight we see that it's simply this the Lord hath

72
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,359
called for a famine not only does he declare that there is a famine that is

73
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:57,079
coming but we find that he tells he specifies the period of time that that

74
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,200
famine would be upon the land we find that it says that it shall come also

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,799
come upon the land seven years that's a lengthy period of time we can look back

76
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:11,119
to the life of Joseph we don't have time this evening to study all of that but

77
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:15,359
you can think about the seven years of plenty in the seven years of famine that

78
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,959
are dealt with there in the life of Joseph when he was in Egypt and so on

79
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,959
and so forth and you can read the passages of scripture and even in a time

80
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,880
when they had purposefully planned during the seven years of plenty for the

81
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,119
famine that would come if you read the passages of scripture in the book of

82
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:40,880
Genesis you can see how difficult that period of famine really was and we find

83
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,000
that as we come here to second Kings chapter number eight we read the

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,160
declaration of Elisha we see the power and sovereignty of God I'm thankful this

85
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,880
evening that our God is sovereign that he is in control of all things and we

86
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:01,119
find that Elisha's declaration is this for the Lord hath called for a famine

87
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,679
see there are some that would like to of course deny the existence of God there

88
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:12,320
are some that would say that God exists but he's really not in control of

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,359
anything he kind of has taken a step back from his creation if you will but

90
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:23,000
we understand that our God is intimately involved with the affairs of mankind we

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,799
can read throughout the whole of scripture we can see the hand of God you

92
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:31,640
can read a book like the book of Esther and you can find that though the name of

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,559
God is not mentioned throughout the ten chapters of the book of Esther oh how

94
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:42,279
you can see the hand of God at work in superseding over the affairs of man and

95
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,959
what a blessing to know that our God is in control that he is sovereign that he

96
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,839
does have all power we find that in this declaration that there was some

97
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,480
instruction that would be given to the woman from Shunam we find that the Bible

98
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,320
says that then speak Elisha unto the woman he was faithful to deliver this

99
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,839
message to this woman and he said here arise and go notice thou and thine

100
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,399
household and sojourn wheresoever thou can sojourn for the Lord has called for

101
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,959
a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years it's interesting we

102
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,600
look at the declaration of Elisha here in verse number one and you see what

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,839
he's announced and who he's announced it to the specifics of that judgment but

104
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,440
it's also interesting to see the response is recorded in verse number two

105
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,479
and really what you're seeing is the obedience of this woman and her

106
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,359
household and we see her response it seems quite evident that she believed

107
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:50,159
the man of God Elisha had proven to be a man of God Elisha had proven that he

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,840
spoke the word of the Lord as I've mentioned many times through the life of

109
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,000
Elijah you see him using that terminology with quite regularity thus

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,039
saith the Lord you don't find that quite as often with Elisha though you find

111
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:10,000
references of it but you know that he's speaking the word of the Lord he is a

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,479
faithful prophet and when he comes to this woman and he gives this declaration

113
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:21,960
she immediately responds with obedience I like that I believe that's exemplary

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,039
for us I believe that there is within the response of this woman there is a

115
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,359
lesson for each of us to learn on the importance of obedience and this

116
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:35,520
obedience of this woman was immediate consider she was going to leave

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,599
everything that she knew she was gonna leave her land she was gonna leave that

118
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:46,960
which was familiar to her notice it says and the woman arose and did after the

119
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,599
saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the

120
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:59,359
land of the Philistines seven years now seven years a long time in some regards

121
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,359
seven years

122
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:05,679
It seems like it just kind of goes by fast.

123
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,699
But seven years, really, that's a long time.

124
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:12,379
And we find that she immediately responds

125
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,439
with obedience.

126
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,059
It says that she arose

127
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,099
and she did after the saying of the man of God.

128
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,499
She and her household.

129
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,199
And they went and dwelt in the land of the Philistines

130
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,899
for seven years.

131
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,619
We see the declaration of Elisha.

132
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,699
Notice number two,

133
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,219
discussion with the king.

134
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,259
It's amazing as you look at what happens.

135
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,719
Again, we find that verse number two

136
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,979
describes for us her departure from Shunam

137
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:44,299
and her arrival into the Philistines' land.

138
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,699
And you come to verse number three

139
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:46,539
and it says,

140
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,999
and it came to pass at the end,

141
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,979
excuse me,

142
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,579
and it came to pass at the seven years end.

143
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,539
And so just like that,

144
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,119
we've gone right through the seven year period of famine.

145
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,339
We don't know.

146
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,779
God doesn't give us all the details of all that happens

147
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:00,979
and so on and so forth.

148
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:04,479
But we do know that the famine has now ended.

149
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,659
And so what happens,

150
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,019
the woman returns.

151
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,499
It says that the woman returned

152
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,579
out of the land of the Philistines.

153
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,299
So she returns after seven years.

154
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,899
And the Bible tells us

155
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,139
that she went forth to cry unto the king

156
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,979
for her house and for her land.

157
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:25,019
As I've referred to this as the discussion with the king,

158
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,639
we find that she went to make a petition to the king

159
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,079
for both her house and her land.

160
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,639
And she'd been gone for seven years.

161
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,079
But now she's coming back

162
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,999
and she's making this request,

163
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,479
this plea if you will.

164
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:42,939
And she's seeking to have a discussion with the king.

165
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,199
But it's interesting because the Bible tells us

166
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:49,499
that though she's interested in having this dialogue,

167
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,239
this discussion with the king,

168
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,959
that the king is actually in the midst

169
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,799
of a discussion already.

170
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,659
The king is having a discussion with Gehazi.

171
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,279
We've not heard about Gehazi for a lengthy period of time.

172
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,439
It was at the end of chapter number five

173
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:08,079
when we last heard about Gehazi.

174
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,719
Remember he was the servant of Elisha.

175
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,959
And we find that Gehazi was there

176
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,439
for many of the miracles

177
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,439
that God would perform through Elisha

178
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,459
during his earthly ministry.

179
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,479
And you find that Gehazi was there

180
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,879
and he saw God work.

181
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,079
And there in chapter number five

182
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,159
when you read about the healing of leprosy

183
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,279
from Naaman and all of that situation,

184
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,199
remember Gehazi decided that he wanted something.

185
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,359
And so he chased after Naaman

186
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,359
and the host that came from Syria.

187
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,239
And as he returned, he says,

188
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,319
I didn't go anywhere.

189
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,599
And of course, he's stricken with leprosy at that point.

190
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,559
And the Bible tells us

191
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
there's actually some interesting division

192
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,159
from biblical scholars.

193
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,719
Some would say that the events in chapter number eight

194
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,519
would reveal that Gehazi no longer had leprosy.

195
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,199
I would disagree with that.

196
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,719
And here's why in the end of chapter number five

197
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,159
in verse number 27,

198
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,519
the Bible says that the leprosy therefore of Naaman

199
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,799
shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever.

200
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,479
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

201
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,279
So I don't believe that he was healed of his leprosy

202
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,959
nor do I believe that the events in chapter number eight

203
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:24,479
preceded what we read of in chapter number five.

204
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,799
I think this is a proper chronological order

205
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,399
of the events in the life of Elisha

206
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,599
and that which happens.

207
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,719
In fact, when you come to the end of chapter number eight,

208
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,999
you really start to see the latter years of Elisha

209
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,639
and some of the announcements that he makes,

210
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,119
I believe, and I'll just give it to you for further study.

211
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,559
If you go back to the book of Leviticus

212
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,439
in chapters 13 and 14,

213
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,199
you'll find how that the priest were to investigate

214
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,279
those that thought they had or did have leprosy.

215
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,999
And they were to go through the process

216
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,839
of how they would go forth

217
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,759
in identifying those individuals,

218
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,439
but also in announcing them clean.

219
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,119
And if you read the portion of Scripture,

220
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:04,719
if they were completely white with leprosy,

221
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,599
they were clean.

222
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,959
And so if you look here in 2 Kings five and verse 27,

223
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,719
it says, and he went out from his presence,

224
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:14,519
a leper white as snow.

225
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,799
And it's very interesting as you look at what happens again

226
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:19,679
back in Leviticus,

227
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,879
and really you got to read all of the entirety

228
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,959
of both of those chapters.

229
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,599
But I'll read one verse for you in Leviticus 13

230
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,919
and verse number 13.

231
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,079
It says, then the priest shall consider and behold,

232
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
if the leprosy have covered all his flesh,

233
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,319
he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague.

234
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,439
It is all turned white, he is clean.

235
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,719
I love the Bible.

236
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,639
You study passage with passage

237
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,519
and you interpret the word of God.

238
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,639
And you begin to see that this Gehazi

239
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,719
is in the presence of the king.

240
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:52,479
Now, he no longer is the servant of Elisha,

241
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:57,159
but now he's somehow having this discussion with the king.

242
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,119
And we find that as he's talking with the king,

243
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,199
it's amazing.

244
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,559
And again, you see the providence of God.

245
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,919
You see the hand of God at work.

246
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,039
This woman from Shunem,

247
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,039
she had received the message from Elisha.

248
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,639
She departs the land because of the famine.

249
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,479
She comes back after seven years

250
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,639
and she desires to have this discussion with the king

251
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,959
to make her petition,

252
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,639
to have her land and her home restored.

253
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,279
And as she enters in,

254
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,599
she interrupts a discussion that's already taking place

255
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,919
between the king and Gehazi.

256
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,519
Look at what the discussion is.

257
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,959
And the king talked with Gehazi,

258
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,519
the servant of the man of God saying,

259
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,239
tell me, I pray thee.

260
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,839
Notice what he asked to know.

261
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,719
All the great things that Elisha hath done.

262
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,399
Isn't that interesting?

263
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
The king says, I wanna know about the works of Elisha.

264
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,639
The Bible tells us in verse number five,

265
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
that it came to pass as he, that's Gehazi,

266
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
was telling the king how he had restored

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,439
a dead body to life.

268
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,759
So he's talking, now listen,

269
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,159
there are many miracles of Elisha.

270
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,159
In fact, the Bible records twice as many miracles of Elisha

271
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,719
than you find of Elijah.

272
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,000
And it seems quite interesting

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,799
as you think about the double portion and what have you.

274
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,119
But we know that there were many, many miracles

275
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:13,679
that God performed through the prophet Elisha.

276
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,279
And as this discussion, this conversation is taking place,

277
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,279
Gehazi is speaking about how this dead body

278
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,839
was restored to life.

279
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,159
It says that, behold, the woman

280
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,039
whose son he had restored to life

281
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,479
cried to the king for her house and for her land.

282
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,279
Isn't that awesome?

283
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,559
I mean, just think about the timing, right?

284
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,279
I mean, just we could say from our human perspective,

285
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,919
what are the chances?

286
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,039
It's not chance, it's providence.

287
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,879
And we find here that Gehazi said,

288
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,439
my Lord, O king, this is the woman

289
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,439
and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.

290
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,239
Isn't that amazing?

291
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,599
You think about the timing.

292
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,679
Elisha said, the Lord's called for a famine,

293
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,719
you need to get out of here.

294
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,279
You and your household, go.

295
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
Sojourn wheresoever you can sojourn.

296
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,679
It's gonna be here for seven years.

297
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,759
And she leaves.

298
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,919
She obeys the instruction of the man of God.

299
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,439
And she goes to the land of the Philistines

300
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,559
and she's there for seven years and she returns

301
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,519
and now she's gonna make the petition

302
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,679
that she could have her home and her land restored.

303
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,719
And as she walks in to speak with the king,

304
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:36,159
Gehazi is telling the king about this miracle.

305
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,639
And then says, in fact, that's her.

306
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,519
Can you imagine?

307
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,879
I mean, it's pretty neat, right?

308
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:45,359
I mean, talk about the proof, the evidence.

309
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,159
We see the declaration.

310
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,199
We see the discussion.

311
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,279
Notice in verse number six, number three,

312
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,919
the decree, the decree of the king.

313
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:56,799
It's interesting as we read verse number six

314
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,519
that it begins really, it says,

315
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,519
and when the king asked the woman, she told him.

316
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,599
What a nice, simple way to let us know

317
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,559
that the account is confirmed.

318
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,079
Now, can you imagine being the king?

319
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,519
Can you imagine being Gehazi?

320
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,759
Can you imagine being the woman?

321
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,199
I mean, put yourself in any of the shoes

322
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,679
of the people that are there.

323
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,719
I mean, to be the woman from Shunem,

324
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,959
to show up and to think,

325
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:23,319
man, they were just talking about us.

326
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,599
To be Gehazi and had just been sharing with the king

327
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,239
about this great miracle and then here she comes.

328
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,799
To be the king and hearing this

329
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
and then man, here's the evidence right in front of me.

330
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,039
And so the Bible says that when the king asked the woman,

331
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,679
she told him, the account is confirmed.

332
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm not sure of how much dialogue they had.

333
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,959
I'm not sure of what details perhaps

334
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,599
the king might've wanted to know.

335
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,919
But you remember that on that particular day

336
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,359
as it's recorded for us in 2 Kings chapter number four,

337
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,159
when her son died, the Bible says that she went up

338
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,320
and laid him on the bed of the man of God

339
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,760
and shut the door upon him and went out

340
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,440
and she then tells her servant,

341
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,359
she says that she called unto her husband and said,

342
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,440
send me, I pray thee, one of the young men

343
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,760
and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God

344
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,839
and come again.

345
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,479
And he said in verse number 23 of chapter number four,

346
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,519
wherefore wilt thou go to him today?

347
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,039
It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.

348
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,760
And she said, it shall be well.

349
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,320
And she gets on the,

350
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,839
she says that they saddled the ass

351
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,119
and said to the servant, drive and go forward.

352
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,719
Slack not thy riding for me except I bid thee.

353
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,000
And they go quickly to the man of God.

354
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,200
And we find that she answered Gazi and said it is well.

355
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,959
And then we know the account and we see what happens.

356
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,599
And Elisha came into the house in verse 32

357
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,320
and the child was dead.

358
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,719
He was upon the bed.

359
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,159
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 33

360
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,599
that Elisha prayed, he prayed unto the Lord.

361
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,159
And then in verse number 36,

362
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,359
he calls for the Shunammite and he said,

363
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,699
Take up thy son.

364
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,779
It's the very account that's being discussed with the king

365
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,579
here in 2 Kings 8, verses 4 and 5.

366
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,979
We find that this account is confirmed.

367
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:21,739
This was not just some story that Gehazi was telling.

368
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,239
This was not some make-believe fairy tale type of thing.

369
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:29,659
No, this was truth of an event that happened.

370
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,079
And I'm so thankful that we have the truth of the Word of God.

371
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,239
I'm so thankful that we can rehearse the miracles of God

372
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,079
and we can rehearse what God has done in our lives

373
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,079
and the lives of others.

374
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,079
We can look at the record of God's Word

375
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,239
and we can understand that they are confirmed.

376
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,319
These are not fables.

377
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,779
They're not stories.

378
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,859
So often you hear me use the phraseology, a Bible account.

379
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,579
I don't believe it's sinful to use the phraseology,

380
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,359
a Bible story.

381
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,639
But sometimes when we read stories to our children

382
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:03,059
that are these fairy tale type of stories,

383
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,019
and all of a sudden we're going to say,

384
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,719
okay, let me tell you a Bible story.

385
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:10,139
Sometimes it's difficult for a child to differentiate.

386
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:11,179
This is a Bible account.

387
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,439
This is something that happened.

388
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,719
We find that the account is confirmed in verse number 6,

389
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,479
and then notice that her request was granted.

390
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,019
It's a decree that the king makes.

391
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,219
The Bible says,

392
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,979
so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying,

393
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,799
Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field

394
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,799
since the day that she left the land, even until now.

395
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,979
I'm not sure how the discussion would have gone

396
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:42,059
if Gehazi wasn't rehearsing these things to the king.

397
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,099
We could speculate.

398
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,379
We could sit around and come up with our theories

399
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,639
as to how the king would respond to this woman,

400
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,339
whether he would just dismiss her from his presence

401
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:54,099
or what he would do.

402
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:57,719
But you find that this woman was obedient to the man of God,

403
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,919
to the declaration that was made with regard to the famine,

404
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,719
and God no doubt had instructed Elisha

405
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,559
to deliver this message to the Shunammite woman,

406
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,719
and she believes and she responds in obedience

407
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,599
and she leaves,

408
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,419
and now when she returns and makes her petition

409
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,799
for her home and her land to be restored,

410
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,879
we find that the Lord's timing being perfect,

411
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,219
these events just as they are,

412
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,139
and the king makes this decree.

413
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,639
He sends an officer and says,

414
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,179
restore, notice what he says,

415
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,719
restore all that was hers,

416
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,599
notice, and all the fruits of the field

417
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,479
since the day that she left the land,

418
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,839
even until now.

419
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,339
What a blessing.

420
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,479
What a great result.

421
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,159
We see through these six verses,

422
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,279
we're reminded of the power of God.

423
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,159
We're reminded of His sovereignty

424
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,719
that He is in control of the affairs of mankind.

425
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,639
And the reality this evening is that

426
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,299
the woman could ask 105 questions

427
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,899
about why she should leave,

428
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:55,839
where she should go,

429
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,979
what she should do,

430
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,299
what's gonna happen to my house,

431
00:22:58,299 --> 00:22:59,579
what's gonna happen to this,

432
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,999
she could ask all those questions,

433
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,659
but she just obeyed.

434
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,679
She just obeyed.

435
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,499
And this evening,

436
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,339
we learn valuable lessons from this account in Scripture.

437
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:13,299
We learn the lesson of obedience.

438
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,299
We learn the lesson of trusting the Lord

439
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,739
and knowing that He is able to do

440
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,039
even what we might not see happening.

441
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,239
I'm not sure what her expectations were

442
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,799
leading into that discussion.

443
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,399
Sometimes we make a request expecting to be denied,

444
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,459
because our faith is little.

445
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,339
I'm not sure what her expectation was going into it,

446
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,799
but all I can say is that

447
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,159
as I look at this passage of Scripture,

448
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,319
I am reminded that God's timing is perfect.

449
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,259
And what a blessing to be able to see

450
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,899
these types of accounts

451
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,539
and to be encouraged in our own walk with God

452
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,819
on the importance of following God and obeying God

453
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:01,539
and seeing God work as only God can work.

454
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:05,119
This evening, we see the Lord hath called for a famine.

455
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,939
God's aware of the things that take place

456
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:10,739
within the affairs of mankind.

457
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:14,799
God is not far off in a distant land somewhere

458
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,259
where He's unaware of those things that are happening.

459
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,959
He's a gracious, merciful God.

460
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,879
He's long-suffering,

461
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:23,599
but we find that He is a righteous God.

462
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,519
He is the righteous judge.

463
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,739
And this passage begins with the announcement

464
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,459
of that judgment, the Lord hath called for a famine.

465
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,279
In a time such as that,

466
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,399
you are reminded of the importance

467
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,719
to turn your attention to the Lord,

468
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:40,039
to consider your ways.

469
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,879
You find the prophets often said, consider your ways.

470
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,839
Consider your ways.

471
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,179
How important it is even as we live in such a time.

472
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,979
I mean, when you look at a global pandemic,

473
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,699
I know it's not a famine,

474
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:56,000
but if you deny that God is in control

475
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,819
and that He is over these things,

476
00:24:57,819 --> 00:24:59,559
you can see God's hand.

477
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,739
Listen, it is time for man to seek the Lord.

478
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:09,619
I disagree 100% with what some of the folks

479
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,399
in our nation have said.

480
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,339
There have been some, I won't name names,

481
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:15,379
there have been some that have been on public television

482
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,479
that have said this is beyond the power of God.

483
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,319
Baloney.

484
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,179
God's in control of all things.

485
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,679
It's amazing how just a little tiny virus

486
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,919
could cause such a global situation.

487
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,819
Oh, that man would turn their eyes upon the Lord.

488
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,899
See, we're dealing with something that pales in comparison

489
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,479
to what will happen during the tribulation.

490
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,279
You read the book of Revelation.

491
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,899
You read all of those judgments, 21 of them.

492
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:47,659
I mean, it's gonna be serious.

493
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,500
This evening, in the time in which this Shunammite

494
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,059
was living, there was gonna be a famine.

495
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,939
The Lord had called for a famine.

496
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:58,659
Righteous judgment.

497
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,819
She obeyed the Lord and she was divinely protected.

498
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:02,919
Can you imagine that?

499
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,099
In the land of the Philistines.

500
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:05,939
There's a whole nother message

501
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,739
we could develop right there.

502
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:10,859
But she was divinely protected by God.

503
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,399
And then she comes back, the timing is perfect,

504
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,399
and she's restored all of her things.

505
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,639
Isn't that amazing?

506
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,599
We serve a great God who's able to do

507
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,319
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

508
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,159
He's able to take care of his own.

509
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,179
Amen?

510
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,500
And we trust him and we follow him.

511
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,339
Let's pray.

512
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,159
Father, we love you this evening.

513
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,719
We thank you for loving us.

514
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:32,239
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

515
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,079
I pray, God, that you'd encourage our hearts tonight.

516
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,599
Help us to be mindful of the fact

517
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,319
that you indeed care for your own.

518
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:43,139
That you're able, no matter the circumstances,

519
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:44,799
to take care of us as your children.

520
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,119
And for that, we rejoice.

521
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,219
We thank you that you have all resources.

522
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:50,579
Lord, we look forward to the day

523
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,439
in which we'll be able to spend eternity with you.

524
00:26:55,439 --> 00:27:00,439
We are looking for the return of the Lord.

525
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,139
We know that it draweth nigh.

526
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,779
God, I pray that you'd help us to be faithful

527
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,299
and obedient to you.

528
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,919
Thank you for the testimony of the Shunammite.

529
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,059
Thank you for the faithfulness of Elisha.

530
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,059
Lord, I pray that you would use us.

531
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,979
Help us to glorify thee in our lives

532
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:16,939
and we'll thank you for it.

533
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,579
In Christ's name we pray.

534
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,419
