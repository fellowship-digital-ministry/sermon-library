WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
second Kings chapter number eight as we continue studying the life of Elisha and

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:10.079
as we now move on into this eighth chapter of course we've spent several

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.880
weeks over the last several Wednesdays we've been in chapter number seven last

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.600
week we took a week off from the life of Elisha looked at a passage of scripture

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.399
with the life of Ezra and what a blessing that was and this evening as we

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.360
get into chapter number eight we will see once again that Elisha has an

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.599
interaction with the woman from Shunem and you'll remember this woman from

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:39.479
Shunem based on our study of second Kings chapter number four is several

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.240
really probably several months ago now when we studied the fourth chapter of

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.040
the book of second Kings and we dealt with the ministry of Elisha and how God

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.959
was working and of course he would pass through Shunem it would go through there

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:57.000
on a somewhat regular basis the Bible says that he passeth continually through

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.639
that place and so the woman at Shunem she spoke with her husband and she said

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.760
we need to make a little chamber and so they had a construction project and we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.040
often refer to a prophet's chamber we use that terminology and we really see

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.760
that it comes from what we see here in second Kings chapter number four and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.440
Elisha had testified of the care in which he received each time he would

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.199
pass through that place not only having a place in which to stay but also the

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:31.000
great care in which he received we find that the of course through the passage

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.360
of scriptures you interact with the lady at Shunem you find of course that they

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.919
had no children and Elisha announces that they'll have a son and what a

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.839
wonderful day that must have been they have a son and then he's out working

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:48.440
with his dad one day in the field and the boy dies and of course the woman

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.839
from Shunem there's no name given she goes to find the man of God and Elisha

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.680
sends Gehazi up ahead and long story short that boy is raised from the dead

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.360
and then we get into chapter 5 really the end of chapter 4 and 5 6 7 you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.479
don't hear anything about Elisha having any interaction whatsoever with the lady

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.199
from the woman from Shunem and her family and now we come to chapter number

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.800
8 and the Bible says then spake Elisha unto the woman notice how it's referred

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.559
to here whose son he had restored to life so of course we know through the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.960
description that is given here in verse number one as to the woman that God is

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.300
referring to that Elisha is going to have this interaction with of course as

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.759
I've mentioned there's been a number of events that have transpired over the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.440
past a few chapters of dialogue that we read in the Word of God and we don't

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.520
know exactly how much time has passed not only from the last interaction to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.639
this we don't know how much time passed between the end of chapter number 7 the

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.720
beginning of chapter number 8 we just know that the dialogue goes into this

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.039
interaction that is recorded here we do know that in just a few verses of

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:07.080
Scripture seven years of famine is covered and it's amazing how sometimes

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.919
you can read super lengthy portions of Scripture and there's just a brief

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.800
amount of time that passes and other times there's just a couple of verses

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.520
and several years can pass and so we find that the Bible says then spake

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.679
thou in thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn notice

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:34.759
for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:40.559
seven years if you're taking notes this evening the Lord hath called for a

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.279
famine that is the title for the message adopted right from verse number one for

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:50.960
the Lord hath called for a famine it's interesting in the Word of God as you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.839
often will find references to God's of course judgment upon his people and you

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:03.399
find that in the Word of God periods of famine most what most times are

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:08.279
representative of divine judgment periods of drought you remember we first

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:13.080
find Elijah we first began to study in first Kings chapter number 17 to the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.079
life of Elijah what do you see he's calling for that drought right there's

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.399
not going to be neither rain nor dew except at my word and we find that three

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.320
and a half years passed and why it was the wickedness of Ahab and Jezebel and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.480
we find that as we move here into the life of Elisha and we have some

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.279
understanding of the the the reign of Jehoram and his wickedness and we find

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:43.079
that the Bible tells us that he cleaved under the sins of Jeroboam the son of

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:48.239
Nebat and of course we dealt with many of those things but we find that here as

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:52.880
we enter into the eighth chapter of the book of 2nd Kings that once again there

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.920
is divine judgment upon the house of Israel because of their wickedness I'm

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.679
thankful that our God is righteous and that he is the righteous judge and we

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:10.160
find that he in righteousness indeed executes judgment and we find that he's

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.880
given truth throughout the entirety of the Word of God with regard to his hand

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.559
of blessing and his time of judgment the reality is that most of us I think if

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.000
all of us are in our right minds we would say that we would much rather have

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.440
times of blessing than times of judgment amen and but we find that the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.720
blessing comes as a result of obedience and honoring the Lord and so we find

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.279
here that as we look at the passage of scripture I want you to see the

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.380
declaration of Elisha the declaration really recorded for us in the first two

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.279
verses here of chapter number eight we see that it's simply this the Lord hath

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.359
called for a famine not only does he declare that there is a famine that is

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:57.079
coming but we find that he tells he specifies the period of time that that

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.200
famine would be upon the land we find that it says that it shall come also

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.799
come upon the land seven years that's a lengthy period of time we can look back

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:11.119
to the life of Joseph we don't have time this evening to study all of that but

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:15.359
you can think about the seven years of plenty in the seven years of famine that

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:18.959
are dealt with there in the life of Joseph when he was in Egypt and so on

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.959
and so forth and you can read the passages of scripture and even in a time

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:29.880
when they had purposefully planned during the seven years of plenty for the

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.119
famine that would come if you read the passages of scripture in the book of

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:40.880
Genesis you can see how difficult that period of famine really was and we find

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.000
that as we come here to second Kings chapter number eight we read the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.160
declaration of Elisha we see the power and sovereignty of God I'm thankful this

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.880
evening that our God is sovereign that he is in control of all things and we

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.119
find that Elisha's declaration is this for the Lord hath called for a famine

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:07.679
see there are some that would like to of course deny the existence of God there

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:12.320
are some that would say that God exists but he's really not in control of

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.359
anything he kind of has taken a step back from his creation if you will but

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:23.000
we understand that our God is intimately involved with the affairs of mankind we

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.799
can read throughout the whole of scripture we can see the hand of God you

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:31.640
can read a book like the book of Esther and you can find that though the name of

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.559
God is not mentioned throughout the ten chapters of the book of Esther oh how

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:42.279
you can see the hand of God at work in superseding over the affairs of man and

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:47.959
what a blessing to know that our God is in control that he is sovereign that he

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:53.839
does have all power we find that in this declaration that there was some

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:59.480
instruction that would be given to the woman from Shunam we find that the Bible

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.320
says that then speak Elisha unto the woman he was faithful to deliver this

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.839
message to this woman and he said here arise and go notice thou and thine

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:16.399
household and sojourn wheresoever thou can sojourn for the Lord has called for

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:21.959
a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years it's interesting we

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:26.600
look at the declaration of Elisha here in verse number one and you see what

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.839
he's announced and who he's announced it to the specifics of that judgment but

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:35.440
it's also interesting to see the response is recorded in verse number two

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.479
and really what you're seeing is the obedience of this woman and her

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.359
household and we see her response it seems quite evident that she believed

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:50.159
the man of God Elisha had proven to be a man of God Elisha had proven that he

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:54.840
spoke the word of the Lord as I've mentioned many times through the life of

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.000
Elijah you see him using that terminology with quite regularity thus

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.039
saith the Lord you don't find that quite as often with Elisha though you find

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:10.000
references of it but you know that he's speaking the word of the Lord he is a

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.479
faithful prophet and when he comes to this woman and he gives this declaration

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:21.960
she immediately responds with obedience I like that I believe that's exemplary

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.039
for us I believe that there is within the response of this woman there is a

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:31.359
lesson for each of us to learn on the importance of obedience and this

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:35.520
obedience of this woman was immediate consider she was going to leave

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.599
everything that she knew she was gonna leave her land she was gonna leave that

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:46.960
which was familiar to her notice it says and the woman arose and did after the

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.599
saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:59.359
land of the Philistines seven years now seven years a long time in some regards

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:02.359
seven years

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:05.679
It seems like it just kind of goes by fast.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:08.699
But seven years, really, that's a long time.

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:12.379
And we find that she immediately responds

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.439
with obedience.

00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:15.059
It says that she arose

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:18.099
and she did after the saying of the man of God.

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:20.499
She and her household.

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:24.199
And they went and dwelt in the land of the Philistines

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:26.899
for seven years.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:29.619
We see the declaration of Elisha.

00:10:29.619 --> 00:10:30.699
Notice number two,

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.219
discussion with the king.

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:35.259
It's amazing as you look at what happens.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.719
Again, we find that verse number two

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:40.979
describes for us her departure from Shunam

00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:44.299
and her arrival into the Philistines' land.

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:45.699
And you come to verse number three

00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:46.539
and it says,

00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:47.999
and it came to pass at the end,

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:49.979
excuse me,

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:52.579
and it came to pass at the seven years end.

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:53.539
And so just like that,

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:56.119
we've gone right through the seven year period of famine.

00:10:56.119 --> 00:10:57.339
We don't know.

00:10:57.339 --> 00:10:59.779
God doesn't give us all the details of all that happens

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:00.979
and so on and so forth.

00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:04.479
But we do know that the famine has now ended.

00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:05.659
And so what happens,

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.019
the woman returns.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.499
It says that the woman returned

00:11:08.499 --> 00:11:11.579
out of the land of the Philistines.

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:14.299
So she returns after seven years.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:15.899
And the Bible tells us

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:19.139
that she went forth to cry unto the king

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:21.979
for her house and for her land.

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:25.019
As I've referred to this as the discussion with the king,

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:28.639
we find that she went to make a petition to the king

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.079
for both her house and her land.

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:33.639
And she'd been gone for seven years.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:35.079
But now she's coming back

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:36.999
and she's making this request,

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.479
this plea if you will.

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:42.939
And she's seeking to have a discussion with the king.

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:46.199
But it's interesting because the Bible tells us

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:49.499
that though she's interested in having this dialogue,

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:51.239
this discussion with the king,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:53.959
that the king is actually in the midst

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.799
of a discussion already.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.659
The king is having a discussion with Gehazi.

00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:02.279
We've not heard about Gehazi for a lengthy period of time.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:04.439
It was at the end of chapter number five

00:12:04.439 --> 00:12:08.079
when we last heard about Gehazi.

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:11.719
Remember he was the servant of Elisha.

00:12:11.719 --> 00:12:13.959
And we find that Gehazi was there

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:15.439
for many of the miracles

00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:18.439
that God would perform through Elisha

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:20.459
during his earthly ministry.

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:22.479
And you find that Gehazi was there

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:23.879
and he saw God work.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.079
And there in chapter number five

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.159
when you read about the healing of leprosy

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:31.279
from Naaman and all of that situation,

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.199
remember Gehazi decided that he wanted something.

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:37.359
And so he chased after Naaman

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:39.359
and the host that came from Syria.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.239
And as he returned, he says,

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:43.319
I didn't go anywhere.

00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:46.599
And of course, he's stricken with leprosy at that point.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.559
And the Bible tells us

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.559
there's actually some interesting division

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.159
from biblical scholars.

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:55.719
Some would say that the events in chapter number eight

00:12:55.719 --> 00:12:58.519
would reveal that Gehazi no longer had leprosy.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:00.199
I would disagree with that.

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:02.719
And here's why in the end of chapter number five

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:04.159
in verse number 27,

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.519
the Bible says that the leprosy therefore of Naaman

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:10.799
shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever.

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:15.479
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:18.279
So I don't believe that he was healed of his leprosy

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.959
nor do I believe that the events in chapter number eight

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:24.479
preceded what we read of in chapter number five.

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.799
I think this is a proper chronological order

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:28.399
of the events in the life of Elisha

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.599
and that which happens.

00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:31.719
In fact, when you come to the end of chapter number eight,

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:33.999
you really start to see the latter years of Elisha

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:35.639
and some of the announcements that he makes,

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.119
I believe, and I'll just give it to you for further study.

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:39.559
If you go back to the book of Leviticus

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:41.439
in chapters 13 and 14,

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:46.199
you'll find how that the priest were to investigate

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:49.279
those that thought they had or did have leprosy.

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:50.999
And they were to go through the process

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:54.839
of how they would go forth

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:56.759
in identifying those individuals,

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:59.439
but also in announcing them clean.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.119
And if you read the portion of Scripture,

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.719
if they were completely white with leprosy,

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.599
they were clean.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:09.959
And so if you look here in 2 Kings five and verse 27,

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:11.719
it says, and he went out from his presence,

00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:14.519
a leper white as snow.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:18.799
And it's very interesting as you look at what happens again

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:19.679
back in Leviticus,

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:21.879
and really you got to read all of the entirety

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.959
of both of those chapters.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:26.599
But I'll read one verse for you in Leviticus 13

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.919
and verse number 13.

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:30.079
It says, then the priest shall consider and behold,

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.399
if the leprosy have covered all his flesh,

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.319
he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague.

00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:39.439
It is all turned white, he is clean.

00:14:39.439 --> 00:14:40.719
I love the Bible.

00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:42.639
You study passage with passage

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.519
and you interpret the word of God.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.639
And you begin to see that this Gehazi

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:49.719
is in the presence of the king.

00:14:49.719 --> 00:14:52.479
Now, he no longer is the servant of Elisha,

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:57.159
but now he's somehow having this discussion with the king.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:59.119
And we find that as he's talking with the king,

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:00.199
it's amazing.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.559
And again, you see the providence of God.

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:04.919
You see the hand of God at work.

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:07.039
This woman from Shunem,

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.039
she had received the message from Elisha.

00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:11.639
She departs the land because of the famine.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:14.479
She comes back after seven years

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.639
and she desires to have this discussion with the king

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:18.959
to make her petition,

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.639
to have her land and her home restored.

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:23.279
And as she enters in,

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.599
she interrupts a discussion that's already taking place

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:27.919
between the king and Gehazi.

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.519
Look at what the discussion is.

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.959
And the king talked with Gehazi,

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:32.519
the servant of the man of God saying,

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:34.239
tell me, I pray thee.

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:35.839
Notice what he asked to know.

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:38.719
All the great things that Elisha hath done.

00:15:38.719 --> 00:15:40.399
Isn't that interesting?

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.279
The king says, I wanna know about the works of Elisha.

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.639
The Bible tells us in verse number five,

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.759
that it came to pass as he, that's Gehazi,

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:52.000
was telling the king how he had restored

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.439
a dead body to life.

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:55.759
So he's talking, now listen,

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.159
there are many miracles of Elisha.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:01.159
In fact, the Bible records twice as many miracles of Elisha

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.719
than you find of Elijah.

00:16:02.719 --> 00:16:04.000
And it seems quite interesting

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.799
as you think about the double portion and what have you.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.119
But we know that there were many, many miracles

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:13.679
that God performed through the prophet Elisha.

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:18.279
And as this discussion, this conversation is taking place,

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:23.279
Gehazi is speaking about how this dead body

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:24.839
was restored to life.

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:27.159
It says that, behold, the woman

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:30.039
whose son he had restored to life

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:34.479
cried to the king for her house and for her land.

00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:37.279
Isn't that awesome?

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.559
I mean, just think about the timing, right?

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:42.279
I mean, just we could say from our human perspective,

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:43.919
what are the chances?

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:47.039
It's not chance, it's providence.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.879
And we find here that Gehazi said,

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:54.439
my Lord, O king, this is the woman

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:59.439
and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.239
Isn't that amazing?

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:02.599
You think about the timing.

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:06.679
Elisha said, the Lord's called for a famine,

00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:08.719
you need to get out of here.

00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:10.279
You and your household, go.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.679
Sojourn wheresoever you can sojourn.

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.679
It's gonna be here for seven years.

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:16.759
And she leaves.

00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:19.919
She obeys the instruction of the man of God.

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.439
And she goes to the land of the Philistines

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:24.559
and she's there for seven years and she returns

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:26.519
and now she's gonna make the petition

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:29.679
that she could have her home and her land restored.

00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:31.719
And as she walks in to speak with the king,

00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:36.159
Gehazi is telling the king about this miracle.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:39.639
And then says, in fact, that's her.

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:40.519
Can you imagine?

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.879
I mean, it's pretty neat, right?

00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:45.359
I mean, talk about the proof, the evidence.

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:49.159
We see the declaration.

00:17:49.159 --> 00:17:50.199
We see the discussion.

00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:52.279
Notice in verse number six, number three,

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:54.919
the decree, the decree of the king.

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:56.799
It's interesting as we read verse number six

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.519
that it begins really, it says,

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:02.519
and when the king asked the woman, she told him.

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:05.599
What a nice, simple way to let us know

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:07.559
that the account is confirmed.

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:10.079
Now, can you imagine being the king?

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.519
Can you imagine being Gehazi?

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:12.759
Can you imagine being the woman?

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.199
I mean, put yourself in any of the shoes

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.679
of the people that are there.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.719
I mean, to be the woman from Shunem,

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:19.959
to show up and to think,

00:18:19.959 --> 00:18:23.319
man, they were just talking about us.

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:27.599
To be Gehazi and had just been sharing with the king

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:31.239
about this great miracle and then here she comes.

00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:32.799
To be the king and hearing this

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.039
and then man, here's the evidence right in front of me.

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:38.039
And so the Bible says that when the king asked the woman,

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:40.679
she told him, the account is confirmed.

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:43.200
I'm not sure of how much dialogue they had.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.959
I'm not sure of what details perhaps

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.599
the king might've wanted to know.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:51.919
But you remember that on that particular day

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:55.359
as it's recorded for us in 2 Kings chapter number four,

00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:00.159
when her son died, the Bible says that she went up

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:02.320
and laid him on the bed of the man of God

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.760
and shut the door upon him and went out

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.440
and she then tells her servant,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.359
she says that she called unto her husband and said,

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:12.440
send me, I pray thee, one of the young men

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.760
and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.839
and come again.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.479
And he said in verse number 23 of chapter number four,

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:21.519
wherefore wilt thou go to him today?

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:23.039
It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.760
And she said, it shall be well.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.320
And she gets on the,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.839
she says that they saddled the ass

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:31.119
and said to the servant, drive and go forward.

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:34.719
Slack not thy riding for me except I bid thee.

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.000
And they go quickly to the man of God.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.200
And we find that she answered Gazi and said it is well.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.959
And then we know the account and we see what happens.

00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:46.599
And Elisha came into the house in verse 32

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:48.320
and the child was dead.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.719
He was upon the bed.

00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:53.159
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 33

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.599
that Elisha prayed, he prayed unto the Lord.

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.159
And then in verse number 36,

00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:02.359
he calls for the Shunammite and he said,

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:05.699
Take up thy son.

00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:08.779
It's the very account that's being discussed with the king

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:12.579
here in 2 Kings 8, verses 4 and 5.

00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:15.979
We find that this account is confirmed.

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:21.739
This was not just some story that Gehazi was telling.

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:25.239
This was not some make-believe fairy tale type of thing.

00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:29.659
No, this was truth of an event that happened.

00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:33.079
And I'm so thankful that we have the truth of the Word of God.

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:36.239
I'm so thankful that we can rehearse the miracles of God

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:39.079
and we can rehearse what God has done in our lives

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:40.079
and the lives of others.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.079
We can look at the record of God's Word

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:45.239
and we can understand that they are confirmed.

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:46.319
These are not fables.

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:47.779
They're not stories.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:52.859
So often you hear me use the phraseology, a Bible account.

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:55.579
I don't believe it's sinful to use the phraseology,

00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:57.359
a Bible story.

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.639
But sometimes when we read stories to our children

00:21:00.639 --> 00:21:03.059
that are these fairy tale type of stories,

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:04.019
and all of a sudden we're going to say,

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.719
okay, let me tell you a Bible story.

00:21:05.719 --> 00:21:10.139
Sometimes it's difficult for a child to differentiate.

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:11.179
This is a Bible account.

00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.439
This is something that happened.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.719
We find that the account is confirmed in verse number 6,

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:19.479
and then notice that her request was granted.

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:21.019
It's a decree that the king makes.

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.219
The Bible says,

00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:24.979
so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying,

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:28.799
Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:34.799
since the day that she left the land, even until now.

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:37.979
I'm not sure how the discussion would have gone

00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:42.059
if Gehazi wasn't rehearsing these things to the king.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:43.099
We could speculate.

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:45.379
We could sit around and come up with our theories

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:48.639
as to how the king would respond to this woman,

00:21:48.639 --> 00:21:51.339
whether he would just dismiss her from his presence

00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:54.099
or what he would do.

00:21:54.219 --> 00:21:57.719
But you find that this woman was obedient to the man of God,

00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:00.919
to the declaration that was made with regard to the famine,

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:03.719
and God no doubt had instructed Elisha

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:06.559
to deliver this message to the Shunammite woman,

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:09.719
and she believes and she responds in obedience

00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:10.599
and she leaves,

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:13.419
and now when she returns and makes her petition

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:15.799
for her home and her land to be restored,

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:20.879
we find that the Lord's timing being perfect,

00:22:20.879 --> 00:22:23.219
these events just as they are,

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:25.139
and the king makes this decree.

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:26.639
He sends an officer and says,

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:28.179
restore, notice what he says,

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:29.719
restore all that was hers,

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:31.599
notice, and all the fruits of the field

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:33.479
since the day that she left the land,

00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:35.839
even until now.

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.339
What a blessing.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:39.479
What a great result.

00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:41.159
We see through these six verses,

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:43.279
we're reminded of the power of God.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.159
We're reminded of His sovereignty

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:48.719
that He is in control of the affairs of mankind.

00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:50.639
And the reality this evening is that

00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:53.299
the woman could ask 105 questions

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:54.899
about why she should leave,

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:55.839
where she should go,

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:56.979
what she should do,

00:22:56.979 --> 00:22:58.299
what's gonna happen to my house,

00:22:58.299 --> 00:22:59.579
what's gonna happen to this,

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:01.999
she could ask all those questions,

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:03.659
but she just obeyed.

00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:04.679
She just obeyed.

00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:07.499
And this evening,

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:11.339
we learn valuable lessons from this account in Scripture.

00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:13.299
We learn the lesson of obedience.

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:16.299
We learn the lesson of trusting the Lord

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:18.739
and knowing that He is able to do

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:22.039
even what we might not see happening.

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:25.239
I'm not sure what her expectations were

00:23:25.239 --> 00:23:26.799
leading into that discussion.

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:31.399
Sometimes we make a request expecting to be denied,

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:34.459
because our faith is little.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:39.339
I'm not sure what her expectation was going into it,

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:40.799
but all I can say is that

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:43.159
as I look at this passage of Scripture,

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:47.319
I am reminded that God's timing is perfect.

00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:50.259
And what a blessing to be able to see

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:51.899
these types of accounts

00:23:51.899 --> 00:23:54.539
and to be encouraged in our own walk with God

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:57.819
on the importance of following God and obeying God

00:23:57.819 --> 00:24:01.539
and seeing God work as only God can work.

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:05.119
This evening, we see the Lord hath called for a famine.

00:24:06.859 --> 00:24:08.939
God's aware of the things that take place

00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:10.739
within the affairs of mankind.

00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:14.799
God is not far off in a distant land somewhere

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:17.259
where He's unaware of those things that are happening.

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:18.959
He's a gracious, merciful God.

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:20.879
He's long-suffering,

00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:23.599
but we find that He is a righteous God.

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:26.519
He is the righteous judge.

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:28.739
And this passage begins with the announcement

00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:31.459
of that judgment, the Lord hath called for a famine.

00:24:32.399 --> 00:24:34.279
In a time such as that,

00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:36.399
you are reminded of the importance

00:24:36.399 --> 00:24:38.719
to turn your attention to the Lord,

00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:40.039
to consider your ways.

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:43.879
You find the prophets often said, consider your ways.

00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:45.839
Consider your ways.

00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:49.179
How important it is even as we live in such a time.

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:51.979
I mean, when you look at a global pandemic,

00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:53.699
I know it's not a famine,

00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:56.000
but if you deny that God is in control

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.819
and that He is over these things,

00:24:57.819 --> 00:24:59.559
you can see God's hand.

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:04.739
Listen, it is time for man to seek the Lord.

00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:09.619
I disagree 100% with what some of the folks

00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:11.399
in our nation have said.

00:25:11.399 --> 00:25:13.339
There have been some, I won't name names,

00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:15.379
there have been some that have been on public television

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:18.479
that have said this is beyond the power of God.

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:19.319
Baloney.

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:22.179
God's in control of all things.

00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:27.679
It's amazing how just a little tiny virus

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:31.919
could cause such a global situation.

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:34.819
Oh, that man would turn their eyes upon the Lord.

00:25:35.719 --> 00:25:38.899
See, we're dealing with something that pales in comparison

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:41.479
to what will happen during the tribulation.

00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:43.279
You read the book of Revelation.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.899
You read all of those judgments, 21 of them.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:47.659
I mean, it's gonna be serious.

00:25:48.979 --> 00:25:52.500
This evening, in the time in which this Shunammite

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.059
was living, there was gonna be a famine.

00:25:55.059 --> 00:25:56.939
The Lord had called for a famine.

00:25:56.939 --> 00:25:58.659
Righteous judgment.

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:01.819
She obeyed the Lord and she was divinely protected.

00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:02.919
Can you imagine that?

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:05.099
In the land of the Philistines.

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:05.939
There's a whole nother message

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.739
we could develop right there.

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:10.859
But she was divinely protected by God.

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:13.399
And then she comes back, the timing is perfect,

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:15.399
and she's restored all of her things.

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:16.639
Isn't that amazing?

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:18.599
We serve a great God who's able to do

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.319
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:26:21.319 --> 00:26:23.159
He's able to take care of his own.

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:24.179
Amen?

00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:26.500
And we trust him and we follow him.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.339
Let's pray.

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:28.159
Father, we love you this evening.

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.719
We thank you for loving us.

00:26:29.719 --> 00:26:32.239
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:34.079
I pray, God, that you'd encourage our hearts tonight.

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:35.599
Help us to be mindful of the fact

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:39.319
that you indeed care for your own.

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:43.139
That you're able, no matter the circumstances,

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:44.799
to take care of us as your children.

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:46.119
And for that, we rejoice.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:49.219
We thank you that you have all resources.

00:26:49.219 --> 00:26:50.579
Lord, we look forward to the day

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:55.439
in which we'll be able to spend eternity with you.

00:26:55.439 --> 00:27:00.439
We are looking for the return of the Lord.

00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:02.139
We know that it draweth nigh.

00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:04.779
God, I pray that you'd help us to be faithful

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:06.299
and obedient to you.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:08.919
Thank you for the testimony of the Shunammite.

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:11.059
Thank you for the faithfulness of Elisha.

00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:14.059
Lord, I pray that you would use us.

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:15.979
Help us to glorify thee in our lives

00:27:15.979 --> 00:27:16.939
and we'll thank you for it.

00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:18.579
In Christ's name we pray.

00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:19.419
Amen.
