00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
And just one chapter in the book of Obadiah,

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.000
and we'll look at just a few verses,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.800
really as a springboard into our message this evening.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.399
And this brief, minor prophet book of Obadiah

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.399
is addressed to Edom.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:23.200
It's only got 21 verses in this short book of the Bible,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
and we find that the descendants of Esau

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.600
are those that are being addressed here,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.799
concerning Edom.

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:32.799
These are the descendants of Esau.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.000
And we understand, and we won't take a lot of time

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.799
this evening to develop all of this,

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:40.400
but historically speaking, the Edomites

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
were in regular conflict with the people of Gob,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.799
the nation of Israel.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.400
And oftentimes, when Israel would face difficulty,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.599
when Israel would face some level of defeat,

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:54.599
we would find that there are many times

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:58.799
in which you could see that the Edomites would rejoice

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.599
when Israel would face some of those hardships

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:03.400
and difficulties.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.199
We are mindful, maybe one of the most familiar accounts

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:11.800
is found for us in Numbers 20, verses 14 through 22,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800
and I'm just going to briefly mention

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.599
that it was during that period of time

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.800
in which Moses made the request to pass through their land.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000
And you'll remember as you think about that portion of Scripture

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.400
that that request was denied.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.000
And we find that God, in this particular book,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.400
as He would use the prophet Obadiah to issue this warning,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.199
this really just a message of doom and judgment,

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.199
we find that Edom would be judged by the Lord,

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:44.599
and her doom was certain.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.400
And we see that, and really in the first few verses,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.400
God gives us some insight here.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
I want you to see in verse number one,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.000
the Bible says,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"...the vision of Obadiah, thus saith the Lord God concerning

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.599
Edom, we have heard a rumor from the Lord,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.599
an ambassador is sent among the heathen,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.599
arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.800
Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
Thou art greatly despised."

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.000
Notice the statement that begins verse number three.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It really will be the subject in which we'll study this evening

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
with this thought of the danger of deception.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Notice verse three,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
"...the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600
Thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.000
whose habitation is high."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Notice this,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"...that saith in his heart,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who shall bring me down to the ground?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.600
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.000
and though thou set thy nest among the stars,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
thence will I bring thee down,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
saith the Lord."

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Her judgment is announced and we find that her doom is certain,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but we notice the insight that God gives us

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
at the beginning of verse number three,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
"...the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The title for the thought, the message this evening,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
"...the pride of thine heart,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the pride of thine heart."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You'll notice the deception that is listed here in verse number three,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
verse number three,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"...the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You'll note that they were not deceived by the enemy without.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Oftentimes, as we've studied these last several weeks

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with the subject matter of the danger of deception,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we've spoken about the age of deception in which we're living.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And obviously, there have been many ages of deception

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and we find that deception is nothing new

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as we studied in the very first week of this series.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We understand that it was deception that was used by the enemy,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
by the devil, there in the garden.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And we find that Paul mentions that Eve was deceived.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And we find that as we would think about all of the tools

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in the toolbox, if you will, of Satan, our enemy, our adversary,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
deception is one that he uses regularly.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And we find here, however, that Edom, the Edomites,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
these descendants of Esau,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they were not deceived by some enemy without.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We've given warning of those that lie in wait,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
waiting to deceive, right?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Let no man deceive you by any means.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we've spoken about these warnings that God gives us

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
within His Word with regard to the danger of deception,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
but here we find they were not deceived by some group of people.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
They were not deceived by some enemy.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
No, it was the pride of their own heart that deceived them.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It was the pride of their own heart that deceived them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
See, the reality is that pride is not only deceptive,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
but pride is destructive.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Pride is destructive.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Let me say this, at some level,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
each and every one of us have to deal with pride.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if we think, I'm not prideful,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you're probably prideful in the fact that you're not prideful.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You understand what I mean?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Pride is something that can get each and every one of us.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And we find that as we think about this subject this evening of pride,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I want you to understand in the Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
it says this of pride, it's inordinate self-esteem.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's a lengthy definition,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but it's very interesting all that is mentioned in the definition here

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in this 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It says that it's an unreasonable conceit of one's own superiority

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in talents, in beauty, in wealth, in accomplishments,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
in rank, or elevation in office.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The pride manifests itself in lofty airs,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
distance, reserve, and often in contempt of others.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We think about pride and we notice the statement that is given here

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in Obadiah in verse number 3,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
as the announcement of judgment, the doom of Edom is made known.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He says, the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Notice what it says,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but then notice this last part of verse number 3,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that saith in his heart,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
who shall bring me down to the ground?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
What are they saying?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I'm superior, no one's going to defeat me,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
no one's going to bring me down.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I have this lofty idea, this inordinate self-esteem,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
this conceit of our superiority,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there's no one that's going to bring us down.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
In fact, if we're mindful of the enemy,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and we spoke about the tool that he often goes to in his toolbox there,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
as is mentioned in Genesis 3,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that tool of deception,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
we find that it was pride that was the sin

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that was found within the heart of Satan, is it not?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Lucifer, he was created, but he was prideful.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
You can read in the Old Testament account

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that God gives us with regard to the fall of Satan,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the fall of Lucifer,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and how he said in his own heart,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I will be like the Most High.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And you think about the pride and the destruction

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and the deception even there in the heart of Lucifer

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
with regard to that pride.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I've mentioned already that pride is deceitful

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
as we see here in this text of Scripture.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We find that pride is destructive.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I want to give you an Old Testament example,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
then we're going to look at some truth

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
within the New Testament that we can apply in our lives.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Go back to 2 Chronicles 26, if you will.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
2 Chronicles 26 gives us the record of King Uzziah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Now, King Uzziah basically would be described

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
as being a good king.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
If you were to take all of the kings of Israel,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you'd be hard-pressed after the divided kingdom,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
you'd be hard-pressed to find any that were good.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
In fact, all of them typically would be labeled

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in the category of being a bad king.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
In Judah, we would find that there were several

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that you would categorize,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and some of them would be categorized

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
as being a good king.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Some of them were very good kings.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Some of them were basically good,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and Uzziah would fall in that category.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And we find that he was helped by the Lord.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
We find that he sought the Lord.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Notice what the Bible says in verse 4 of 2 Chronicles 26,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and he, speaking of Uzziah, did that which was right

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
in the sight of the Lord.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Look at verse 5, and he, Uzziah,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
sought God in the days of Zechariah,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
who had understanding in the visions of God,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and as long as he sought the Lord,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
God made him to prosper.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Oh, there's a very vital principle

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in that verse of Scripture,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the importance of seeking God

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and having God's favor in our lives.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Notice in verse 7, the Bible says,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and God helped him.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Aren't you thankful that God is the helper?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
He is my helper, and He helped him.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Notice the Bible says in verse 8,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
for he strengthened himself exceedingly.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
at the corner gate and at the valley gate

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and at the turning of the wall and fortified them.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
God was blessing and God was helping Uzziah.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We find that at the end of verse 15,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the Bible says, for he was marvelously helped.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Notice those last four words.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Till he was strong.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Oh, this is a turning point in the life of Uzziah,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
unfortunately.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
We find that in this particular time,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
we find that he failed to recognize

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that though they had great advancements,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
though they had experienced great deliverance,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and though God had blessed them exceedingly,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
the Bible says,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.800
that He was marvelously helped till He was strong.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.860
And then it says this in v. 16,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.819
but when He was strong, what happens?

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:17.899
His heart was lifted up to His destruction.

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:20.020
I do not think it would be much of a stretch

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.860
to say that that phrase,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.500
His heart was lifted up,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.420
could be synonymous with being prideful.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.420
Amen?

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.219
His heart was lifted up,

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:33.500
and the Bible says, to His destruction.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.180
For He transgressed against the Lord his God.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.939
He went into the temple of the Lord

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:41.099
to burn incense upon the altar of incense.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.500
Now, as a king,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.020
He was not permitted to engage in this activity.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.680
This was reserved for the priests.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.060
This was not something that the king

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.299
was privileged to do,

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:54.900
to enter into the temple and to offer incense.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.759
And we find that He did, however, why?

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:58.819
Because He was strong.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.560
Because His heart was lifted up,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.000
and it was lifted up to His destruction.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.760
And the Bible tells us that Uzziah,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.959
that he became a leper.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:09.919
He became a leper.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.239
God judged him.

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:13.639
We find that there were some men

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.139
that withstood him,

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:19.180
and according to v. 17,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.680
it says that they were valiant men

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.819
and they withstood Uzziah the king.

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.559
And basically, they tell him

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.620
it's not for him to do what he's doing.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.080
It's not to engage in this activity.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.959
This is not the service that the king

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:32.199
is to engage in.

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:34.279
And we find that he's wroth with them

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:35.720
in v. 19,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.099
and had a censer in his hand to burn incense.

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:40.559
And while he was wroth with the priest,

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:43.480
the leprosy even rose up in his forehead

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.199
before the priest in the house of the Lord

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:48.459
from beside the incense altar.

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:51.239
He was leprous in the middle of v. 20,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:52.239
in his forehead,

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:54.120
and they thrust him out from thence.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.860
Uzziah himself hasted also to go out

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.139
because the Lord had smitten him.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:03.620
Nebuchadnezzar learned something

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.779
about the ability that God has

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:08.880
to abase or to humble someone.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.539
Remember, Nebuchadnezzar's the great king of Babylon.

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:13.320
And he of course,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.300
as he would stand there before Shadrach,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.020
Meshach, and Abednego,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.699
as they would defy the order

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:20.220
to bow down to that image

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.639
that had been created,

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:23.940
who is that God that shall deliver thee?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.080
Remember, in the book of Daniel,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.580
and we find that shortly thereafter,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.720
that Nebuchadnezzar finds out who God is,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.800
and we find that though he continues

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.500
in his pride and he understands,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.779
listen, he was powerful.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:40.199
But he's not all powerful.

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:43.080
And after God sent him out for a season

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.160
to live like a wild animal

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.080
and to grow as an animal

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.740
and to live and behave as an animal,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.520
he acknowledged that God is able to humble.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.000
God is able to abase.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.660
And we find that pride is deceitful.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.000
It causes people...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.380
Look, you think about Uzziah here.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.839
He had been helped and God had blessed

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.880
and he had trusted and depended

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.339
and sought the Lord,

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:13.380
but when his heart is filled up,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.720
when he's strong,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.559
his heart was lifted up with pride

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:20.039
and it was lifted up to his destruction.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.880
Notice in the New Testament, if you will,

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:24.479
look at 1 Corinthians 10.

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:25.979
We'll look at a couple of verses

00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:28.059
here in the New Testament.

00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:31.039
1 Corinthians 10 will be the first example

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:31.880
that we look at.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.020
You notice that in this particular passage of Scripture,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.500
Paul, as he's speaking to the believers in Corinth,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.580
he begins with giving them a number of examples

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.160
from Old Testament biblical record

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.539
of the children of Israel

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.960
and the ways in which God was not pleased with them.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.800
In fact, it says in verse number five

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.320
of 1 Corinthians 10,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.880
but with many of them, God was not well pleased

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.679
for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.639
And then he gives examples.

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.320
There are five examples that are given

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.940
in the next several verses

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.179
of the events in which God was not pleased

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.520
with the behavior of these people.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.600
We find that he says this in verse number 11.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.360
Now, all these things happened unto them

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.079
for in samples and they are written

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:20.720
for our admonition

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.880
upon whom the ends of the world are come.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.320
And so we find that we're given the truth

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.160
in the book of Romans

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.720
that the things that were written aforetime

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.119
are written for our learning.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.279
Here we find that he says

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:32.320
that they're written for our admonition.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.200
And notice what he says in verse number 12.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.200
Wherefore, let him that thinketh he standeth

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.100
take heed lest he fall.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.160
Let him that thinketh that he standeth

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.000
take heed lest he fall.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.720
What was the deal with Edom, with the Edomites?

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.799
They thought that they were in a place

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:57.079
in which they were superior,

00:14:57.079 --> 00:14:59.380
that they could not be taken down,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.239
but they failed to recognize the omnipotent God

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.320
and they failed to recognize the judgment

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.720
that would come from God.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.000
They were deceived.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.959
The pride of their heart had deceived them.

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:13.720
And we find that here, the word of God tells us

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.600
that we need to, that he that thinketh that he standeth,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.679
we need to take heed lest he fall.

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:22.920
It's interesting how many times you find

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.839
the phrase take heed coupled in a verse of scripture

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:29.600
that deals with the subject of deception.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.299
And you find that here,

00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:35.299
the word deception is not listed in verse number 12,

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:37.720
but no doubt as we think about the context

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.880
and the instruction that is being provided,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.119
let him that thinketh he standeth

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.239
take heed lest he fall.

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:48.519
Listen, there's not one of us that in our own power

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:53.519
are any match for Satan, in our own power.

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.760
We can't, what did Paul say in Ephesians six?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.359
We wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:02.540
but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.760
That's why we're instructed to be strong in the Lord

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.380
and the power of his might.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.040
That's why we're instructed to put on the whole armor of God

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.019
because in of ourselves, for me or for you,

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:16.260
none of us have the ability to go toe-to-toe with Satan

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.339
and be victorious.

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:20.100
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.059
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:27.059
Oh, you think about Paul when he speaks about his own life,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.579
and he says that he knows that in him that is in his flesh,

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.820
well, if no good thing, he cries out

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.440
after he goes through the discourse

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.859
of the things that he would, he does not,

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:39.179
the things that he would not, that he does.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.540
He says, oh, wretched man that I am,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.260
who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.540
And he says, I thank God, what, that Christ Jesus,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.540
he is the one that enables us to be victorious.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.779
And we understand here in the text of Scripture

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:57.899
that we ought not go through life thinking

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:00.500
that we can withstand the enemy

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.339
in our own power and own strength.

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:06.899
Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed, lest he fall.

00:17:06.899 --> 00:17:09.779
How many times someone has deceived themselves

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.299
into thinking that they can go and they can,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:16.059
we mentioned this from 1 Corinthians a couple of weeks ago

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:18.019
when we looked at the subject matter,

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:20.140
I guess it wasn't last week, it was the week before,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.619
we spoke of spiritual distancing in 1 Corinthians 15, 33,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.260
that evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.339
And the reality is that there are times in which people,

00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:33.880
in fact, the people of God, oh, I can be in this place

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.079
or I can do this thing and it's not gonna affect me.

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:43.239
Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed, lest he fall.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.079
What a great warning.

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:49.440
Galatians chapter number six, turn over, if you will,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.320
several pages and look at the truth

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.239
that God gives us here in Galatians six.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.839
Last week, we spent time in Galatians six,

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.720
verses seven and eight, dealing with the subject

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.399
of sowing and reaping with regard to deception.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.320
But what we find in verse number three,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.040
notice this, how Galatians six, three couples

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.279
with 1 Corinthians 10, 12,

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:17.440
and really Obadiah, verse number three,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.640
we find here in Galatians six and verse number three,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.480
look what it says,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.040
for if a man think himself to be something

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.679
when he is nothing, what does it say?

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:29.519
He deceiveth himself.

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:33.119
Oftentimes, I've said over the years

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:35.520
as we speak about the subject of deception

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.520
in various contexts that we can be deceived by others,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.320
but really the most dangerous deception is self-deception.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.640
When we've deceived ourselves

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.840
and the thinking we're something that we're not.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.400
And here we find that the truth of all

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.559
that has been given in the book of Galatians

00:18:56.559 --> 00:19:01.559
with regard to walking with God and living for God

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.520
and being crucified and crucifying our flesh,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.359
the old man and walking in the spirit

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:10.000
so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.239
And then we come to this sixth chapter

00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:13.520
and we find that he says,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.960
if a man think himself to be something

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.880
when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.239
You know, I believe this evening

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:29.159
that the child of God that understands his inability

00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:35.000
to engage in battle with Satan in his own power

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.799
and relies fully on the power of God

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:40.239
and puts on the whole armor of God,

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:44.039
I do not think that the enemy really has any desire

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:48.280
to engage in conflict or battle with that Christian.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.760
You know who he loves to do battle with?

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.000
The Christian that thinks he can handle it himself.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.520
The Christian that thinks I can, I got this,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.359
I can handle this.

00:19:58.359 --> 00:19:59.200
Why?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.559
Because he's gonna be so much more.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:06.439
but when we go in the power of God and the power of the Holy Spirit when we

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:11.159
recognize that that we're nothing I'm thankful that I'm a child of God that

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:14.839
I've been saved by the blood of Christ and I'm adopted in the family of God but

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:20.679
I recognize that my flesh man I I can't do battle with Satan I I don't want to

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.679
deceive myself it's interesting in the book of Jude you don't need to turn over

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:29.159
there but it's interesting that Michael the archangel in Jude verse number 9 it

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:33.299
says yet Michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:37.999
about the body of Moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but

00:20:37.999 --> 00:20:45.959
said the Lord rebuke thee that's Michael the archangel having this this dispute

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:50.519
with with the devil and he did not bring against him a railing accusation but

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:57.479
simply said the Lord rebuke thee oh what great lesson for us from that example in

00:20:57.479 --> 00:21:02.199
the book of Jude I want you to think of the Church of the Laodiceans turn to the

00:21:02.199 --> 00:21:06.399
book of Revelation if you will and this will be the last example that we look at

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:11.279
of the destruction and the deception of pride and then I'm going to give you

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:17.399
some verses with regard to the remedy how is it that we can ensure that we do

00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:24.239
not become deceived by the pride of our own heart we'll look at some verses here

00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:28.319
in just a moment but look in Revelation 3 we look at the Church of the Laodiceans

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:32.919
it's very interesting if you couple this verse with where we started in the book

00:21:32.919 --> 00:21:39.199
of Obadiah and I mentioned as we look there at the at the book of Obadiah in

00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:46.959
that third verse how that they said this they said who shall excuse me in his

00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:52.199
heart who shall bring me down to the ground notice what is said in Revelation

00:21:52.199 --> 00:22:00.000
3 because thou sayest who says this is the Church of the Laodiceans correct

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.559
contextually you understand the the letter to the Church of the Laodiceans

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:08.639
begins in verse number 14 and God is speaking to the church and it says

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:12.959
because thou sayest the Church of the Laodiceans the the members of that

00:22:12.959 --> 00:22:20.119
church because you say I am rich and increased with goods and have need of

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:27.279
nothing that's what they say that's their perspective but notice what the

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:37.080
verse says and knowest not they were deceived weren't they God says here's

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:42.639
what you say but here's what you don't know what you don't know is that you are

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:51.399
wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked is there not a great

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:58.239
contrast between what God says they are and what they think they are what do

00:22:58.239 --> 00:23:04.399
they say oh we're increased with goods we have need of nothing we're rich

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:11.000
that's what you say but what you don't know is that you are wretched and

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:22.279
miserable and poor and blind and naked who's right God or man who's right God

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:26.839
is always right correct so we can say whatever we want to say Church of the

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:31.119
Laodiceans can say whatever they want to say but God says I'm gonna set the

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:34.160
record straight here's what you say here's your testimony here's what you

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.639
have have identified as is who you are and what you are you're you're rich

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:44.919
you're increased with good you have need of nothing but here's what I say

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:54.720
their heart their pride the pride of their heart hath deceived them if you

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.639
read the devotional book that we gave out in the beginning of the year and I

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:03.759
hope you do I hope it's a blessing to in your family just a couple of days ago I

00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:07.199
don't remember exactly which day it was but just a couple of days ago there was

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:12.599
an example of a lawyer that was setting up his office anyone remember reading

00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:16.279
that just a couple of days ago right and that lawyer was setting up his office he

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:19.720
was just a young lawyer and man he is setting up his office and he wanted

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.239
everyone to know how and how good his practice was going already and

00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:27.739
everything going and he heard the door open and so he he kind of got behind his

00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:32.519
desk and he picked up the phone and he's talking like he's talking to a client oh

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:36.239
yeah yeah we can do that well my schedule is kind of busy and but this

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:40.440
time on this day yeah that'll work yes and then the fellow that opened the door

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.399
comes around the corner and he kind of acts like you know hold on a minute and

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:46.519
he kind of puts the phone and says can I help you and the guy says I'm with the

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:54.880
phone company I'm here to set up your phone service that's pretty good pride

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:02.000
listen the Edomites it was the pride of their own heart that deceived them

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.440
Uzziah what happened what was the destruction why was the destruction he

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:13.459
had been marvelously helped but then he's strong see before he was strong he

00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:19.040
recognized he needed God but then he's strong after God marvelously helped him

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:27.000
and then his heart is lifted up to his own destruction he says I know I'm the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.040
king but I think I'm gonna I'm gonna do the service of the priest Uzziah you're

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.720
not permitted to do that but he does New Testament let him that thinketh he stand

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.480
take heed lest he fall he that thinketh he is something when he's nothing he

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.720
deceiveth himself Church of the Laodiceans we are this this is what we

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.880
say in God says but here's what you don't know this is really what you are

00:25:53.880 --> 00:26:00.959
so what's the remedy how do we prevent the pride of our own heart deceiving us

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:06.559
because if we'd be honest this evening there are we deal with pride let me give

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:09.720
you some verses of Scripture 1st Corinthians 1 we got to go quickly 1st

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.399
Corinthians 1 and we're gonna look at just a few verses I won't make a whole

00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:18.000
lot of comment they explain themselves well but notice in 1st Corinthians 1 in

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.959
verse 27 but God has chosen the fullest things of the world to confound the

00:26:23.959 --> 00:26:30.320
wise God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.919
are mighty base things of the world and things which are despised have God

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:39.399
chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are why that no

00:26:39.399 --> 00:26:47.279
flesh should glory in his presence verse 31 that according as it is written he

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:54.359
that glorieth what does it say let him glory in the Lord look at 1st Corinthians

00:26:54.359 --> 00:27:00.279
chapter number four let me ask you this as you're turning there did the church

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:05.559
and Corinth that they have issues with pride yeah they did that was one of the

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:10.480
reasons for all their separation and all their problems one of the things that

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.720
they were you know what they were so prideful over their spiritual gifts can

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.399
I tell you a secret about spiritual gifts you don't sign up for it the Holy

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:26.880
Spirit of God gives it to you as he will for his glory that's what the Bible

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.720
teaches us and so these guys are all prideful and they're all prideful about

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.160
the fact that they have these spiritual gifts and my spiritual gift is better

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.160
than your spiritual gift they're prideful over the people that they

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:45.559
associated with I'm a Paul I'm of Cephas all right and we find here that

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:48.720
that notice what is said in 1st Corinthians 4 verse number 6 and these

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.760
things brethren I have in a figure transferred to to myself and to Apollos

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.799
for your sakes that you might learn in us what is it that they need to learn

00:27:57.799 --> 00:28:05.399
not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up

00:28:05.399 --> 00:28:11.320
for one against another is that not dealing with pride absolutely that's

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.799
exactly the context and what he's dealing with he says I'm writing these

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:20.040
things to you that you might learn in us through our example not to think of men

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.679
above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:32.399
another now notice verse number 7 it's so just basic but it's so impactful for

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:36.799
us to understand the remedy of being deceived by the pride of our own heart

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:42.039
notice what Paul says in verse number 7 for who maketh thee to differ from

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:50.960
another notice this and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:59.200
didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hath not received it I mean we

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.239
we kind of sometimes in our culture we get wrapped up into this I'm a self-made

00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:10.159
man kind of an attitude can I tell you what Paul said we won't take time to

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:16.279
look there but in first Corinthians 15 he says I am what I am by the grace of

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:23.279
God listen I understand there are times we say but I have this great mind who

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:29.119
gave you the mind that you have in just a moment God could make you not be able

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:35.760
to think straight right you say but I have this talent I have this ability I

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.479
have this no no you better give God glory you better stop thinking that it's

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:45.880
all about you you better not be deceived by the pride of your own heart and so

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:51.000
the questions that are asked in verse number 7 are so impactful and they're so

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.159
helpful for us that we recognize as we would think really I believe that the

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:00.159
questions that are posed in verse number 7 they are what I would refer to

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:02.400
as

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.580
probing questions.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.280
What do you have that you did not receive?

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.100
And if you just keep tracing it back,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.240
you have to recognize as a child of God

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.820
that it was God that blessed you with it.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.180
In the book of Deuteronomy,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.140
you know what God says to His people?

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.500
It's God that gives them the ability to get wealth.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.160
You couldn't go to work tomorrow

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.920
if God didn't let you wake up.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.740
Am I right?

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.980
Whose air are you breathing?

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.940
God's air, right?

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.460
And we find, listen, everything that we have

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.380
is because of the grace of God.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.580
Everything that we have and everything that we are.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.100
Now, if we recognize that it's because of the grace of God,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.620
it's a result of the grace of God,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.460
where is room for pride?

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.460
It's really gone, is it not?

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.780
There's no room for pride when I have that proper perspective.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.580
Notice, and we'll just look at this last verse,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.900
Galatians 6.14,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.060
if I'm going to glory, I'm going to glory in Christ.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.780
But notice in 1 Peter 5.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.340
In 1 Peter 5, James 4 and verse 6

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.220
is a great verse of Scripture dealing with humility as well.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.780
But I want to close quickly here

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.180
with 1 Peter 5, verses 5 and 6.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.200
Notice what Peter says.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.300
He says this in verse 5,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.960
Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves unto the elder,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.500
yea, all of you be subject one to another.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.580
Notice what he says,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.060
Be clothed with what?

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.100
With humility.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.780
Be clothed with humility.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.900
Why?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.940
For God resisteth the proud,

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.340
and giveth grace to the humble.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.020
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.700
that He may exalt you in due time.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.820
Oftentimes, as I've read verse 6,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.620
I've said in my heart, I'll say it now out loud,

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.260
that if you don't humble yourself,

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.700
God is able to humble you.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.180
And let me say it this way as well,

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.260
it's a whole lot better for us to humble ourselves

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.900
than for God to have to humble us.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.580
Amen?

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.940
And as we look at the verses of Scripture,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.860
listen, as we look at 1 Corinthians

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.660
and we answer the question,

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.780
what do we have that we did not receive?

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.620
If that's not enough for us to recognize

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.860
that as we answer those questions

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.740
that there's no room for pride,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.540
then when we come to a verse of Scripture

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.300
like 1 Peter 5 and verse number 5

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.420
and James 4 and verse 6 says the same thing,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.220
when we see that the Bible tells us

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.740
that God resisteth the proud,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.020
when we find in the book of Proverbs

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.180
that God hates pride,

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.740
where is there room for pride?

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.660
We say, man, I don't wanna be deceived.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.780
I don't want the pride of my own heart to deceive me.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.780
We find that it was the pride of their own heart

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.500
that deceived the Edomites.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.780
Who's gonna bring us down?

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.820
God said, I'm gonna bring you down.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.020
Their destruction was certain.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.380
Their doom was known.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.620
As New Testament believers,

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.660
I trust that God would help us.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.700
There's the danger of being deceived

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.100
by those that lie in wait,

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.540
and there are many.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.340
There are many deceivers.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.900
But oh, that God would help us to guard

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.620
against self-deception,

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.380
that the pride of our own heart would not deceive us.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.180
We say, how do I deal with pride?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.180
Recognize all that I am and all that I have

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.100
is because of God,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.380
because of His grace,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:50.340
because of His amazing, abundant grace.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.100
I am what I am by the grace of God.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.020
I say, God resists the pride.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.820
I don't want God to resist me.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.940
I want God's favor.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.740
I want God's help.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.420
I don't want God resisting me.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.180
He giveth more grace to the humble, amen?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.740
And so the remedy is there.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.060
Oh, that God would help us to prevent

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.220
in our own lives of this danger

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.780
of the pride of our heart deceiving us.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.620
Father, we love You.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.580
We thank You for loving us.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.620
We thank You for Your Word,

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.540
the truth contained therein.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.180
I pray that You'd help us tonight, Lord,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.860
with this subject matter,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.900
the age of deception in which we're living,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.300
the danger of deception.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.900
Would You help us to take heed to Thy Word?

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.740
Help us, Lord, to focus upon those verses

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.540
of remedy for pride.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.580
Bless our time of prayer.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.740
We thank You for the privilege,

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.060
which in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.380
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin?

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.820
You didn't get one when you came in this evening?

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.660
You need one?
