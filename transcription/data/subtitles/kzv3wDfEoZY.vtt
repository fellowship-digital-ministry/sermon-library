WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
chapter number two, and I'm going to tell you right at the beginning of the message

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.599
that we're going to be at a number of different portions of Scripture this morning, and so

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.399
I hope that you have your fingers ready, limber, to turn and to look at some other passages

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:17.440
this morning, and I'll do my best to keep up with you, and you keep up with me, and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.940
I often have told some folks I don't mark. I know some preachers that put little bookmarks

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.319
and little paper clips to mark the other passages they're going to go to. I don't do that on

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:33.319
purpose so that I have to turn to it as well, and so sometimes I'm a little impatient, and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:36.240
so I'll try to be a little patient this morning because I know we have a number of verses

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.259
to go to. For the last several weeks, we've been talking about how great our God is and

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.479
dealing with the fact that our God is great in power. I'm so thankful that the Lord God

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:51.520
Omnipotent reigneth, amen, and He is in charge, He is in command, He is all-powerful. We've

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.439
had for our theme this year in 2023, great is the Lord. We understand how great He is,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.900
greatly to be praised, and He is worthy of your praise and my praise, and we should stand

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.080
in awe of who He is. We find that over the last several weeks, we've had the opportunity

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.919
as we've studied the Scriptures to see some accounts where God demonstrates His great

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:20.360
power. As you open the pages of this precious book, you'll find over and over accounts of

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.000
God's mighty power on display so that we can see just how powerful and how mighty He

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is. In fact, we could spend months looking at those particular accounts and dealing with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.279
all of the wonderful truth that God gives us concerning His great power, but we're going

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:44.639
to move forward this morning and begin looking at a new subject because we answer this question,

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:49.279
how do you know that God is great? You come in and you say, great is the Lord. I agree,

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:56.440
God is great. Why is He great? How is He great? Well, we say He's great in power and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.160
He is, but this morning we're going to start and look at just for a few weeks that He's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.639
great in love. I'm thankful for the love of God, aren't you? Begin to think about the

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:12.720
subject of God's love and begin to think about examining this truth over the next several

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.639
weeks. This morning, more of an introductory kind of a message, if you will, for the next

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.919
few weeks with regard to the love of God. But I'm familiar, and you are as well, with

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:28.440
a hymn in our hymnal, and it's one, there's a lot of hymns about the love of God, there

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.880
really is. You look through the pages of any hymnal, you can look at a number of different

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.600
hymnals, little choruses that we sing about Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.119
tells me so, and what a wonderful little song that is to sing and to teach our children.

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:47.679
But I'm thankful for what the hymn writer said when he said this, I'm so glad that our

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:55.279
Father in heaven tells of His love in the book He has given. He goes on to say this,

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.960
wonderful things in the Bible I see. Surely, if you've read the Bible, there's some wonderful

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.320
things in the Bible that you see. But the songwriter said it this way, this is the dearest

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.279
that Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:26.039
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me. This morning, I'm going to preach

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:31.720
a message that I've simply entitled His Great Love. It's interesting, we've studied the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.639
last couple of weeks about God's power on display in the life of Moses and the children

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.839
of Israel and what they had the opportunity to see. And last week, we dealt with the subject

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:47.320
of there in Exodus, chapter number 14, we went into chapter 15 a bit as well, and dealing

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.479
with God's deliverance from Egypt and how that they were eyewitnesses of His great power.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:59.320
And it's exciting to hear about God's work, it's exciting to read about how God works

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.520
in other people's lives, but when you have the opportunity and the privilege to be an

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.520
eyewitness of what God is doing and how God is working, I mean, that's at the top of the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.199
list. You have front row seats, and what a blessing to be an eyewitness of God's great

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.399
work. It's interesting, you don't need to turn there, but in Hosea, chapter 11, in verse

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.279
number 1, Hosea, of course, is prophesying with regard to all sorts of things, but in

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:29.579
chapter 11, in verse number 1, there's a message, a statement that is made about an event that

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.880
took place years earlier, the event that we actually studied over the last couple of weeks.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.920
And here's what the Word of God says in Hosea 11, in verse number 1, when Israel was a child,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.399
the Bible says, then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt. And as much as we see

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:55.839
God's power on display, as we did, we see that Hosea references God's love, and how

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:03.799
in love God was bringing His child, the children of Israel, out of Egyptian bondage. We see

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:10.760
His power in doing that, but we see the love that motivated that, and what a blessing to

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.040
understand that. As we look here in Ephesians, chapter number 2, notice in verse number 1,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.440
the Bible says, and you hath He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.760
in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.440
the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, among

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.480
whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.720
the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.519
even as others. So thankful for the first two words of verse number 4, but God, but

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:59.239
God, but God who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:06.040
we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by grace you're saved, and

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.040
hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.019
and in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace and His kindness

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:21.720
toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.519
of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast, for we

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:33.559
are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained,

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:39.959
that we should walk in them. You notice in verse number 4, the Bible says, for His great

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:45.399
love wherewith He loved us. Over the next few moments this morning, I want to share

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:50.160
with you this thought of His great love. Notice with me if you're taking notes, number 1,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.679
the love of God declared, the love of God declared. No doubt in my mind most of us would

00:06:55.679 --> 00:07:02.799
have heard at some point, many of us probably have memorized John chapter 3 and verse number

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:08.839
16. John 3, 16 is one of the most common known verses in all of the Bible. In fact, I remember

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:12.760
as a child, I remember before we ever went to church, before I knew anything, I didn't

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.799
even know that there was a book of the Bible that was called John. I had no idea, no concept

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:22.239
whatsoever, and I remember watching a football game on a TV as a child and seeing someone

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:28.079
hold up a sign in the stadium that said John 3, 16. I had no idea what that meant. I had

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.959
no idea. In fact, at that particular time in my life, I didn't even have anyone that

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:38.000
I could ask what that meant. My parents weren't saved. My parents didn't go to church. And

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.559
you know, I would submit to you this morning that as many of us in this particular room

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:48.040
understand, perhaps have memorized, have heard repeatedly the truth of John 3, 16, there

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.519
is a world of people that have no idea that God loves them. This morning, we see God's

00:07:55.519 --> 00:08:04.000
love declared in that powerful, so familiar verse of Scripture, for God so loved the world.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.200
Wow, that's a precious declaration that God gives us in His Word, that He sent His only

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.920
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.480
life. And I'm so thankful that God, in that single verse of Scripture, not only did He

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.720
declare His love, but He demonstrated His love, and we'll look at that in just a moment.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.299
But as we begin to think about God's love being declared, we understand that God reveals

00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:31.119
to us in His Word that God is love.

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:34.239
Look over, if you will, at the book of 1 John. Again, I mentioned that we'll look at a few

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:38.840
verses of Scripture this morning and be in a few places, but look at 1 John chapter 4.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.640
I want you to look at a couple of verses of Scripture with regard to the statement that

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:51.119
God gives us here, that God is love. The Apostle John had the privilege to be the human

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:55.280
penman, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, to write the Gospel of John,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.239
and also to write these three short epistles, 1, 2, and 3 John. We find that as John would

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:04.760
refer to himself, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, in the Gospel of John,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.919
as the disciple whom Jesus loved. Oh, what a blessed thought, what a blessed truth that

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.719
John understood that God loved him. And we find that as John is now writing this first

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:22.000
epistle, and he's speaking about chapter 3 and 4, there's many references in both of

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.159
those chapters about God's love, we find that in chapter number 4, notice what he says in

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:30.760
verse number 8, he that loveth not knoweth not God, and then notice the statement, for

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.239
God is love. We find again, repeated in verse number 16, and we have known and believe the

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:43.880
love that God hath to us, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.719
and God in him. It's interesting, as John begins writing in 1 John, he talks about how

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:54.960
he was an eyewitness of these things, having seen and heard the statements that he makes

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.960
in verse number 3 of chapter number 1, and then now here in 1 John 4, in verse number

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.159
16, he says,

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:08.159
He says, and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:11.159
God is love.

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:16.159
I'm thankful this morning that God has revealed to us in the pages of Scripture

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:20.159
that He is love and He has declared His love.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:23.159
Again, this morning there are many people, unfortunately,

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:27.159
that do not know the simple truth that we take for granted.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.159
I mean, we know it, we've heard it, we repeat it,

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:34.159
but to understand this morning that God loves us,

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:36.159
it's declared in His Word.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:39.159
Notice the demonstration, number two, very quickly.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:41.159
We're going to try to get to our third point here this morning

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:43.159
and look at a number of things.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:45.159
But notice number two, if you're taking notes,

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:48.159
the love of God not only declared, but the love of God demonstrated.

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:50.159
The love of God demonstrated.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:53.159
I'm thankful, I mentioned this when we dealt with the subject of God's power,

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:59.159
and we said that it would be perfectly fine if God simply said to us,

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:03.159
declared to us who He is, that He is all-powerful.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:07.159
He could make that declaration and it would be settled truth.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.159
Would you agree this morning?

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.159
He says, I have all power.

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.159
Okay, that settles it.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.159
We believe that.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:14.159
But God not only declared that He's all-powerful,

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:17.159
He then demonstrated that He's all-powerful.

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:21.159
And He gives us example after example as you read the Bible

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:25.159
and you read the accounts of God's Word and of God's power,

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:30.159
you have the opportunity to know not only did God say that He had all power,

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:32.159
but He revealed it to us.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.159
He demonstrated His great power.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.159
This morning the case is true with regard to God's love.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:42.159
God is love, and God declares to us that He loved the world,

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:45.159
but He demonstrated that love.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:50.159
He revealed in the pages of Scripture His love for us.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:52.159
I think of Daniel.

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:53.159
We're not going to turn there.

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:56.159
But on three occasions in the book of Daniel,

00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:00.159
Daniel is referred to as being greatly loved.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:02.159
What a blessed truth.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:06.159
Begin to understand this morning that God demonstrated His love to us.

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:08.159
We've read John 3.16 already.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:09.159
I've quoted it to you.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:13.159
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:16.159
That's the demonstration of God's love.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:18.159
The declaration is that He loved the world,

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.159
but then He gave of His Son.

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:21.159
Why?

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:23.159
So that we could be redeemed, so that we could have salvation

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.159
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:28.159
We sang this morning, saved, saved.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.159
And I'm so thankful to be saved.

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:32.159
Aren't you thankful to be saved this morning?

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:34.159
Listen, you understand what the alternative is, right?

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.159
It's to be lost.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:37.159
There's only two conditions for mankind.

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:39.159
You're either saved or you're lost.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.159
Period.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.159
End of story.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:44.159
This morning I'm thankful to be saved.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.159
Saved by the blood of the Lamb.

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:49.159
What a blessing to know that Heaven is our home.

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:52.159
But we understand that the only way for man to be saved

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:55.159
was through the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:56.159
The just for the unjust.

00:12:56.159 --> 00:13:00.159
And we find this morning that this great love of God

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:03.159
that was declared in His Word, it's been demonstrated to us.

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:05.159
Look at Romans chapter number 5.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.159
Again, familiar verses of Scripture,

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:11.159
but I hope this morning that as we come together in this place,

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:13.159
as we gather to worship the Lord,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.159
that we stand in awe of who He is

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:18.159
and that we say, you know what makes my God so great

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:21.159
is that His great love.

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:23.159
His great love.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:26.159
You know, there are people that, world religions,

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:35.159
I mean people that are following religious groups of people,

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:37.159
they don't believe that God loves them.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:40.159
They don't know anything about the love of God.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:42.159
Notice in Romans 5 and verse number 8, the Bible says,

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:47.159
but God commendeth His love toward us,

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:52.159
in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:57.159
While we were yet sinners, we're at enmity with God.

00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:03.159
But yet, God's great love was demonstrated at Calvary.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:06.159
I'm so thankful for a place called Calvary.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.159
We sing the song at Calvary.

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:10.159
In fact, we sing the song and can it be

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:12.159
that the chorus is amazing love?

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:18.159
How can it be that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:21.159
I remember being at the nursing home years ago

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:24.159
and we would have ministry there.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:27.159
In fact, it's the place where Miss Joyce is now.

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:30.159
The name has been changed from Manor Care to Arden's Court.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:32.159
We would go there on a monthly basis

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:34.159
and we'd sing songs with the residents

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.159
that would gather together for service.

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:39.159
We had one time a month that we'd go.

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:42.159
We'd sing songs and they really didn't want any preaching.

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.159
They said, we want you to come,

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:46.159
but we don't want you to preach.

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:49.159
Well, how do you tell a preacher not to preach?

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:52.159
So here's what I did. I preached through song.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:55.159
I would pick songs and I would give them to Miss Jackie.

00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:58.159
She played the piano faithfully for us over there.

00:14:58.159 --> 00:15:01.159
We'd have a list of songs and through those songs

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:03.159
I would bring verses of scripture

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:06.159
and the songs would kind of be an outline

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:08.159
for the message on that particular day.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.159
I remember sitting there one day

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.159
and we were going to sing at Calvary

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:14.159
and some of you that were there on that day

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:16.159
probably remember this.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:18.159
There was a man that was there

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:21.159
that his wife was a patient in that particular place

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.159
and she was not well at all.

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.159
But this man retired and loved his wife.

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.159
He was there with her every day.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.159
He got there every morning

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:31.159
and he stayed until the late hours at night.

00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:33.159
He was there every day with her.

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:36.159
That man was faithful to bring his wife to our service

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:38.159
and to attend as well.

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:40.159
But they were lost.

00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:43.159
And he said this to me after we sang that song at Calvary.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:45.159
He said, what is it that you mean

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:48.159
when you say at Calvary?

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:51.159
What is this place that you're singing of?

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.159
And I'm so thankful that we know

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:55.159
what happened at Calvary.

00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:59.159
God's love was demonstrated at Calvary

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.159
when he hung upon that cross.

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:03.159
When he was beaten and battered and torn

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:05.159
for you and for me and for the world,

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.159
he was demonstrating his great love.

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:10.159
And we know that he was crucified,

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:12.159
he was buried, but he rose again.

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:14.159
And what a joy to know

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.159
the love of God demonstrated towards us.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:18.159
Notice in 1 John chapter number 3,

00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:21.159
I mentioned that 1 John in chapter 3 and 4,

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:24.159
both of those chapters, so many references to God's love.

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:27.159
But notice in 1 John chapter number 3,

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:31.159
we'll look at two verses here in this text of Scripture.

00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:33.159
And I want you to see what God says

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.159
about the demonstration of his love.

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:37.159
We see that yes, his love is declared,

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:39.159
but I'm thankful that it was demonstrated for us

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:42.159
and that we can look to the pages of God's word

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:44.159
and we can say, look, this is how God

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:47.159
demonstrated his love.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:49.159
See, this morning when you tell someone

00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:51.159
that you love them,

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:54.159
it's important to do that, to tell someone I love you.

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:57.159
But then how do you demonstrate your love?

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:59.159
How do you demonstrate your love

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:01.159
for your spouse, for your children,

00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:04.159
children to your parents, and so on and so forth.

00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:07.159
And we see that God is providing us

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.159
with a record of how he demonstrated his love.

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:11.159
Notice in verse number 1 of 1 John 3,

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:12.159
the Bible says,

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:15.159
Behold, what manner of love

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:20.159
the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:25.159
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:27.159
Therefore the world knoweth us not,

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:28.159
because it knew him not.

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:30.159
He continues in verse number 16.

00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:31.159
Notice what he says.

00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:36.159
Hereby perceive we the love of God,

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.159
because he laid down his life for us.

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:40.159
Because he laid down his life for us.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.159
And we ought to lay down our lives

00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:44.159
for the brethren.

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:46.159
Notice in chapter 4,

00:17:46.159 --> 00:17:48.159
in verses 9 and 10,

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:49.159
the Bible says this,

00:17:49.159 --> 00:17:52.159
And this was manifest, the love of God,

00:17:52.159 --> 00:17:53.159
toward us.

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:56.159
Do you see the love of God,

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.159
it's toward us.

00:17:58.159 --> 00:18:02.159
It's that God loves us as his creation.

00:18:02.159 --> 00:18:04.159
We find that in verse number 9 of chapter 4,

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:05.159
1 John, it says,

00:18:05.159 --> 00:18:08.159
And this was manifest, the love of God,

00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:09.159
toward us,

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:11.159
because God sent his only begotten Son

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:12.159
into the world,

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:15.159
that we might live through him,

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:17.159
here in his love.

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:18.159
Not that we loved God,

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:19.159
but that he loved us,

00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:23.159
and sent his Son to be the propitiation

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:26.159
for our sins.

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:28.159
We see that word used by John

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:30.159
here in this text of scripture,

00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:32.159
and we'd understand that he uses it

00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:34.159
in chapter number 2 as well.

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:35.159
In verse number 1 of chapter 2,

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:36.159
the Bible says,

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:38.159
My little children, these things write I unto you,

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.159
that ye sin not.

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:41.159
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:43.159
Jesus Christ the righteous,

00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:46.159
and he is the propitiation for our sins,

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:48.159
and not for ours only,

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:52.159
but also for the sins of the whole world.

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:54.159
The Bible would use that word propitiation

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:56.159
here in 1 John 2 and chapter number 4 as well,

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:58.159
and really the Old Testament,

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:59.159
the idea of that mercy seat

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.159
over top of the Ark of the Covenant,

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:03.159
and how it's the satisfaction,

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:06.159
and how God's demonstrated his love to us

00:19:06.159 --> 00:19:07.159
through being,

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:10.159
God sent his Son to be the propitiation for us.

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:12.159
He satisfied the demand.

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:14.159
See, the Ark of the Covenant

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:17.159
was an ark of judgment apart from the mercy seat,

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:19.159
but you apply that mercy seat,

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.159
and it fits perfectly on that Ark of the Covenant,

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:23.159
and it shows the grace, mercy,

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:26.159
and love of God Almighty.

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:28.159
What a blessed truth.

00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:33.159
He has demonstrated his love toward us,

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:37.159
and it's through that great sacrifice there at Calvary.

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:39.159
You noticed in verse number 10,

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:40.159
he began by saying,

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.159
here in his love,

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:42.159
not that we love God,

00:19:42.159 --> 00:19:43.159
but that he loved us.

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:44.159
We see in verse number 19,

00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:46.159
it says we love him because he first loved us.

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:48.159
You'll often hear people say,

00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:49.159
I love God.

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:50.159
We ought to love God,

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:52.159
but we must understand that we only love him

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:54.159
because he first loved us.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:56.159
And we understand that God teaches us in his word.

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.159
In fact, if you get into the fifth chapter,

00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:00.159
and we won't do that this morning,

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:04.319
that there's evidence that would support the claim.

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:07.719
When someone says, I love God, there ought to be some evidence in their life that would

00:20:07.719 --> 00:20:08.879
support the claim.

00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:12.719
It's easy to say, I love God.

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:14.719
But does the evidence support the claim?

00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:16.699
If you love God, we're to keep His commandments.

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:20.719
He says that in the Gospel of John and again in 1 John chapter number 5.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:24.279
But we find that we love Him, but we love Him because He first loved us.

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:27.519
You understand that He was the initiator.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:31.159
We were at enmity with God, but He loved us.

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:32.879
He demonstrated His love toward us.

00:20:32.879 --> 00:20:35.939
Notice in the book of Revelation, just a few more pages over.

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:42.039
In Revelation chapter number 1, we find that John is receiving this revelation, the revelation

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:46.519
of Jesus Christ, according to verse number 1 of Revelation 1.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:56.299
And notice, we find that the churches in Asia are going to receive letters, but before the

00:20:56.859 --> 00:21:00.739
content of those letters are given, notice what the Bible says in verse number 4 of chapter

00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:01.739
1.

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:06.499
John to the seven churches which are in Asia, grace be unto you and peace from Him which

00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:10.979
is and which was and which is to come, from the seven spirits which are before His throne,

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.459
aren't you thankful that He's eternal?

00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:16.239
He's alpha and omega, that'll be mentioned in verse number 8.

00:21:16.239 --> 00:21:20.539
Notice in verse 5, and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:27.299
of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth, unto Him that loved us and washed us

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:32.899
from our sins in His own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father,

00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:39.099
to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:44.139
Behold He cometh with clouds and every eye shall see Him and they also which pierced

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:48.099
Him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him even so, amen.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:52.139
And I am alpha and omega, beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:55.499
and which is to come, the Almighty.

00:21:55.499 --> 00:22:00.619
I'm thankful that God demonstrated His love at a place called Calvary.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.659
What a blessed truth.

00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:07.659
We have a cross that hangs above our baptistry.

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.779
You all can see it, it's to my back.

00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:18.379
And I hope that when you see that cross that it reminds you of what Christ did at Calvary,

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:21.779
you'll note that our cross is empty.

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:27.419
There are some crosses that you can find that still have Christ on the cross.

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:30.259
But we do not have a cross such as that.

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:31.259
Why?

00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:33.939
Because Christ is no longer on the cross.

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:39.779
This man after offered one sin or one sacrifice for sins forever.

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:42.059
He sat down, His work was finished.

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:45.899
He's at the right hand throne of God at the throne room of heaven.

00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:51.299
We find that our cross has no Jesus hanging on it for the cross is empty.

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:55.899
He was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:22:55.899 --> 00:23:01.899
It was at that place, Golgotha, a place called Calvary where God demonstrated His love for

00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:05.859
you and for me and for all the world.

00:23:05.859 --> 00:23:08.819
What a blessed truth of God's word.

00:23:08.819 --> 00:23:14.619
We see the Bible gives us the record of God's love, God's word, God's love declared.

00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:17.219
It gives us the demonstration of God's love.

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:20.099
But I want you to notice number three this morning.

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:25.619
Not only His love declared and demonstrated, but the love of God described.

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:30.299
How would you describe or maybe I should say define God's love?

00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:32.019
How would you describe it?

00:23:32.019 --> 00:23:36.619
I'm going to think about God's love this morning and throughout this week as I've meditated

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:41.059
upon this truth and this thought of God's love.

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:48.139
And I want to share with you seven thoughts with how we can describe the love of God.

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:52.779
How can we this morning describe God's love?

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:56.339
We find that He says, for God so loved the world.

00:23:56.339 --> 00:23:58.259
And I'm thankful for that little word so.

00:23:58.259 --> 00:24:03.939
It gives some emphasis there and we understand that He so loved the world that He declared

00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:04.939
it and demonstrated it.

00:24:04.939 --> 00:24:08.179
But I want to share with you some verses of Scripture that I will hope that will help

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:14.259
us this morning to understand how God's love is described biblically.

00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:19.379
Understand this morning that there are some people in our world that have sought to define

00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:21.579
who God is.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:24.739
And it's contrary to what God says in His word.

00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:29.219
Not only do they seek to describe or define who God is, but there are some that have tried

00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:36.099
to take this truth of God's love and twist it to their own benefit, quote-unquote.

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:40.259
They've tried to say, well, God is love and God loves me and therefore I can do whatever

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:42.499
I want to do.

00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:44.779
Wrong.

00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:46.819
That's not what God's word teaches us.

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:54.419
It's a very prominent, very popular thought within our society today.

00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:56.099
Who are you that you can judge me?

00:24:56.099 --> 00:25:01.339
God loves me and God said He loved me and I can do whatever I want to do.

00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:03.059
Is that how you love your children?

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:09.259
How many of you say, I have children and I love them?

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:11.179
I hope everyone raised their hand.

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:13.139
He's helping his mom raise his hand.

00:25:13.139 --> 00:25:14.699
My mama loves me, amen.

00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:16.699
Praise the Lord.

00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:17.699
Right?

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:23.859
Each one of you that raised your hand saying, I have children and I love them, you don't

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:26.659
let your kids do whatever they want to do.

00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:28.579
You know why?

00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:34.399
Sometimes kids have bad ideas.

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:38.819
We don't have the level of wisdom as children that we do as adults.

00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:42.579
So, you know, that's not really a good idea.

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:44.299
Not going to let you do that.

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:45.299
Why?

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:46.299
Because I love you.

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:51.579
So we're going to think about God's love and how it would be described to us biblically.

00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:54.419
And we find in the verse of scripture that we started with in Ephesians 2 and verse

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:58.299
number 4, very simply it's defined as being great love.

00:25:58.299 --> 00:26:02.979
And I'm thankful for that little word great because it's a, it's a big word.

00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:09.139
It's an important word that, that for His great love wherewith He loved us.

00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:15.099
See our God is great and our God's love is great.

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:20.379
And this morning when we begin to think about God's love and begin to think about how great

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:29.139
His love is toward us, I'm just thankful to be a recipient of His great love.

00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:33.819
Not only is His love great, but I would say this, His love is an everlasting love.

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:40.379
Let's look at Jeremiah, if you will, Jeremiah chapter number 31.

00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:46.939
We find that here Jeremiah records for us this truth with regard to God's love and we

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:52.539
find here that it's described as being an everlasting love.

00:26:52.539 --> 00:26:58.899
By the way, only an eternal God can describe His love as being eternal or everlasting.

00:26:58.899 --> 00:27:02.459
It's in His very nature, it's who He is.

00:27:02.459 --> 00:27:08.619
In Jeremiah 31 and verse number 3, the Bible says, the Lord hath appeared of old unto me

00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:18.579
saying yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness have

00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:20.339
I drawn thee.

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:24.179
I'm so thankful that God's love never ends.

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:25.859
God never stops loving you.

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:30.339
We're going to look at a couple of examples over the next couple of weeks, actually not

00:27:30.339 --> 00:27:33.779
the next couple of weeks because we have missionary and then missions conference and so on and

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:34.779
so forth.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.259
But when we get back to this subject of God's great love in the month of June, we'll begin

00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:45.219
to look at a couple of examples and listen, we ought never doubt God's love for us.

00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:49.299
There may be some circumstances that we deal with, there may be some difficulties that

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:54.739
we face in life, but when we face those difficulties, when we have those adversities that come in

00:27:54.739 --> 00:28:01.059
our path in our life, we must never doubt the love of God because His love is an everlasting

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:02.059
love.

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:07.219
And I'll tell you, I'll give you a preview, the passage we're going to deal with is John

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:08.219
11.

00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:14.059
Listen, when Jesus delayed His departure to go after He'd heard that Lazarus was sick,

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:23.699
the Bible declares that Jesus loved Lazarus, Martha, and Mary, but yet He delayed His departure.

00:28:23.699 --> 00:28:30.499
Listen, when we face difficulties in life, we must never doubt God's love.

00:28:30.499 --> 00:28:31.699
It's an everlasting love.

00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:34.659
I would say this, how do I describe God's love?

00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:36.619
It's sacrificial.

00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:37.619
It's sacrificial.

00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:40.659
Number three, it's sacrificial.

00:28:40.659 --> 00:28:45.339
God's love is defined in the Scriptures.

00:28:45.339 --> 00:28:49.659
There are three Greek words, really there are four Greek words that are used for love,

00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:52.059
three predominantly in the Scriptures.

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:58.339
And the love of God is also always used in this sense of this agape love, and you've

00:28:58.339 --> 00:29:05.819
probably heard that word, and the truth is that God's word is a, or God's love is a sacrificial

00:29:05.819 --> 00:29:06.819
love.

00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:11.459
First of all, the Bible says in the book of Ephesians.

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:16.940
The book of Ephesians in the fifth chapter, we've made some reference to some verses of

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.659
Scripture on how God's love was demonstrated to us, it was demonstrated through His sacrifice

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.059
at Calvary.

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:27.339
We find that here in Ephesians chapter number five, God is dealing with relationship in

00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:33.419
the home, and dealing with the importance of roles within the home, at the end of chapter

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:38.899
five and into chapter number six, He deals with husbands, wives, and children, and gives

00:29:38.899 --> 00:29:43.099
good instruction with regard to how we're to behave ourselves in the home and what our

00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:44.779
roles are, so on and so forth.

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:49.019
And verse number 22, He begins that text of Scripture, and by the way, it's important

00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:54.979
for us to understand that the only way that we'll really be able to fully satisfy what

00:29:54.979 --> 00:30:00.219
God has given us here is if we're filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:30:00.219 --> 00:30:05.419
upon the face of the earth, Jesus would have died for you. Because the only way for man

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:12.219
to be reconciled to God was through a substitutionary atonement. And if you're the only person to

00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:22.939
ever walk the face of the earth, Jesus would have died for you because He loves you personally.

00:30:22.939 --> 00:30:29.379
I would say this, finally number seven this morning, how would we describe God's love?

00:30:29.379 --> 00:30:35.979
It's protective. It's protective. There are too many verses to be able to go to, to be

00:30:35.979 --> 00:30:41.719
able to describe this morning how God's love is protective. I said how the world would

00:30:41.719 --> 00:30:49.699
often describe the love of God as being permissive. But I say no, I argue that God's love is protective.

00:30:49.699 --> 00:30:55.939
So many people look to God's Word and they criticize, they find reason to criticize God's

00:30:55.939 --> 00:31:01.099
Word because they say, well God's Word, the Bible, it's just full of a bunch of commandments

00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:05.299
and do this and don't do this and all of those things. I would submit to you this morning

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:11.259
that all of those things are there because God loves us. God loves us so much that He

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:15.339
says, I want to protect you not only from an enemy that you have, but I want to protect

00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:20.699
you from yourself. So that we wouldn't be in a condition where they were in the book

00:31:20.699 --> 00:31:24.179
of Judges where every man did that which was right in his own sight. But no, we'd be in

00:31:24.179 --> 00:31:28.539
a place where we understand these things are pleasing to God, these things are not pleasing

00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:36.819
to God. And God loves us so much that He wants to protect us. And thus He's given us all

00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:41.619
of these wonderful truths in His Word. And oh, I hope this morning that you've never

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:46.579
approached God's Word and if you have that you would no longer approach God's Word as

00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:53.099
just being a list of do's and don'ts, a rule book so to speak. No, this is a precious living

00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:59.419
book and God loves us so much that He said, I want to protect you and therefore I'm giving

00:31:59.419 --> 00:32:05.019
you these truths because I love you.

00:32:05.019 --> 00:32:13.499
Why do we tell our kids to stay away from certain things? Why do we instruct our children

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:23.339
to not play with the fork in the outlet? Because we love them. You say, but Johnny wants to

00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:28.859
play with his fork in the outlet. I don't care. You're not going to let him because

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:37.859
you love him. Because there's something that you understand about electricity and forks.

00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:47.479
The two do not go together, at least in a positive way. It could be in great danger

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:54.799
to Johnny. For sake of illustration this morning, I don't care how much of a fit Johnny throws,

00:32:54.799 --> 00:33:02.639
you would be outside of your mind to let Johnny put a fork in an outlet. Why? Simply

00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:08.319
because you love him. And I would submit to you this morning that if you let him do that

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:13.559
and he died and someone were to come and do an investigation and say, why did you let

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:17.519
him do that? Well, because I love him. I think the person doing the investigation would look

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:21.599
at you like you're crazy. What do you mean you love him? Why would you do that if you

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:32.639
love him? It doesn't make any sense. Our God's love is protective. This morning, His

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:40.079
great love. We'll look at, over the next couple of messages that I preach on this subject,

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:48.359
we'll look at some examples in God's Word. We'll rejoice in the fact that nothing can

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:57.279
separate us from the love of God. This morning, I hope that we've been encouraged to know

00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:07.279
that God loves us. It's declared, it's demonstrated, it's described, defined for us in His Word.

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:13.999
And it's a wonderful love, it's a great love. This morning, I say with the songwriter, wonderful

00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:23.239
things in the Bible I see. There's some amazing things in the Bible. I love this book. I do.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:29.759
But as the songwriter said, this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Let's pray together.

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:37.319
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your great love. God,

00:34:37.319 --> 00:34:44.239
I pray that if there's one here, one under the sound of my voice, that's never trusted

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:53.479
Christ as their Savior. God, I pray that today they'd get it settled, they'd be saved. Lord,

00:34:53.479 --> 00:34:58.839
maybe there's some here this morning that are struggling. They just faced some storms,

00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:03.999
some difficulties. I don't know all of the conditions of those that are gathered this

00:35:03.999 --> 00:35:12.959
morning. But typically in a group of any size, some folks that have some struggles

00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:24.079
and some difficulties. And maybe, just maybe, the enemy, the accuser, the brethren has sought

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:32.639
to cause that individual to doubt your love. I pray this morning they'd have victory over

00:35:32.639 --> 00:35:43.679
that. Not for another second would they doubt your great love that you have for them. I

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:57.399
