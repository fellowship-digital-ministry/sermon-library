1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
this portion of scripture this morning.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,440
And we, of course, last week started a mini-series

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,880
on preparation for revival.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,119
And in the message last Sunday morning,

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,039
I sought to establish the need for revival.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,719
We looked at the book of Nehemiah in the first chapter,

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,959
and we understood that Nehemiah requested a report,

8
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,600
he received a report, and his response

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,719
is really what we focused upon,

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,680
and how he responded to the report that he'd received.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,680
And I sought to provide you last week

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,040
with a report on the church in America.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,560
And as we began to look at a number of statistics last week,

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,639
I believe that it was quite evident

15
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,919
that we are in need of revival.

16
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,200
I said this, and it's worth repeating,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,639
no longer should we shift the focus

18
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:52,319
upon another group, another denomination,

19
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,000
another whatever you want to label somebody as,

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,279
in order to expose their sin or their failure.

21
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:04,440
But rather, we must desire the light of God's Word

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,959
to be focused upon us as individuals,

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,319
and in our local church,

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,639
and acknowledge the need for revival.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
We mention this, that revival, a very simple definition,

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

27
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:25,040
We understand that as we acknowledge

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
the need for revival,

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
that we could sit here this morning,

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,279
and we could say, okay, we acknowledge,

31
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,160
we understand, we agree with the truth

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,879
that we need revival, now what?

33
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,080
Thus, we've titled the message this morning,

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
The Pathway to Revival.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,040
The Pathway to Revival.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
And I want you to understand

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,000
at the very beginning of the message this morning

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
that the pathway to revival,

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,919
there are many hindrances to that pathway.

40
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,319
We find that there are many things

41
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,599
that will cause the people of God

42
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,400
to even perhaps acknowledge the need,

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,279
but never step foot on the pathway to revival.

44
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,680
Maybe they consider the cost,

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,500
and they say the cost is just too great.

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,800
They're not really willing to change things.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,559
They're not really willing to pay what the cost is

48
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,679
to truly have revival.

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,100
The hindrances to revival are many.

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,179
We find that the enemy does not desire

51
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:22,279
for the people of God to be revived.

52
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,759
He is perfectly content and satisfied

53
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,279
with God's people being apathetic and indifferent.

54
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:31,080
He is absolutely just perfectly fine

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,240
with the church of God in America being comfortable.

56
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,160
God never called us to comfort.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,839
In fact, He said,

58
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,279
"'Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

59
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,520
"'shall suffer persecution.'"

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,559
We find that we look at the church of the Laodiceans

61
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,320
referred to there in Revelation chapter number three,

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
and they were a church that was,

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,259
man, they were comfortable.

64
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,240
They had everything that they needed, quote unquote.

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,440
They were apathetic and they were indifferent.

66
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,119
They had this perspective that they had need of nothing,

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
and really even the Lord,

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
because the Lord was on the outside of the church

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,820
that He bought with His blood, knocking.

70
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,699
This morning, as we think about the pathway to revival,

71
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:26,179
we consider the hindrances that are there,

72
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,419
and we understand that there'll be great difficulty,

73
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,139
but I hope this morning that we've acknowledged the need

74
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,179
and we've determined that I wanna get

75
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,300
on the pathway to revival.

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,759
Revival is for the individual.

77
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,940
Let me say this, revival is a work of God.

78
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,380
It is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

79
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,860
It is a work of God Almighty, and the psalmist said this

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,300
in Psalm 85 in verse number six.

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,940
He says, "'Wilt thou,' speaking of the Lord,

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,020
"'wilt thou not revive us again?'

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,220
It's a work of God.

84
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,020
We cannot manufacture the work of God.

85
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,339
We ought not ever seek to manufacture the work of God.

86
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:08,860
We simply desire that God would work,

87
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,179
and this morning, we understand that revival

88
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,259
is a work of God.

89
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,979
I would say this, we're in a place and a position

90
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,660
in our lives and in our nation where we come to a place

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,559
of being desperate to see God work.

92
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,859
We're desperate to see God work.

93
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:30,700
The psalmist said this in Psalm 119 in verse 126.

94
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,700
He said, "'It is time for thee, Lord, to work,

95
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,700
"'for they have made void thy law.'"

96
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,540
Think about that phrase.

97
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,420
It is time for thee, Lord, to work.

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,059
We are desperate to see God work.

99
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,500
We are desirous to see God work,

100
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,420
and as we think about this pathway to revival,

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,619
as we seek to embark on this pathway,

102
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:01,559
and we draw our attentions to what the prophet of God

103
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,019
said in Hosea 10 in verse number 12,

104
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,980
it's a familiar verse of Scripture,

105
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,100
but I want you to notice in verse number 12 of Hosea 10,

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,820
notice what the word of God says.

107
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,440
"'Sow to yourselves in righteousness,

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,220
"'reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground,

109
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,660
"'for it is time to seek the Lord,

110
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,260
"'till He come and reign righteousness upon you.'"

111
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,160
Of interest to me in this particular verse of Scripture

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,339
is that little phrase in the middle of the verse

113
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,660
where it says, "'For it is time to seek the Lord.'"

114
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,420
We mentioned that the psalmist declared in Psalm 119

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,459
in verse number 126, "'It is time for thee, Lord, to work,'

116
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:46,260
but here the prophet of God is saying to the people of God

117
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,220
that it's time for you to do some things.

118
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,820
And yes, revival is the work of God,

119
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,140
but we ought to be in a position where we are prepared

120
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,619
for God to send revival.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,619
And as we look at this particular passage of Scripture,

122
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm gonna go a little bit out of order

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,359
of how it's actually worded here in verse number 12,

124
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,640
but I want you to notice as we think about this truth

125
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,239
of the pathway to revival, I seek to get,

126
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,279
I embark upon this journey, this path to revival,

127
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,600
I must first of all, I would say this,

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,000
it is time to plow, it's time to plow.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,799
Notice the verse of Scripture,

130
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,519
it says this in the middle of the verse there,

131
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,399
"'Break up your fallow ground.'"

132
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,799
Break up your fallow ground.

133
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,899
We understand the agricultural analogy

134
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,660
that is being used here by the prophet of God,

135
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,059
and we find that as he's using this agricultural analogy

136
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,540
that he's seeking to establish spiritual truth,

137
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,220
oftentimes in the Old Testament,

138
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,940
you'll find that the people of God

139
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,779
had hearts that were hardened,

140
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,500
they had hearts that were not prepared for the word of God,

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,899
they were resistant, they were stiff-necked,

142
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,100
they were rebellious,

143
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,920
and we find that their heart was not right with God.

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,359
They would go through the motions many times,

145
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,179
and they would bring their sacrifices,

146
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,260
and they would say that we fasted,

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,179
but God's saying, listen, I'm concerned about your heart.

148
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,500
Your heart is far from Me.

149
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,339
And we find that as we look here

150
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,660
at this phrase of Scripture where the Bible says,

151
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,339
break up your fallow ground,

152
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,540
and we begin to think about the importance of our heart

153
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,459
being ready to receive the truth of the word of God,

154
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,820
being ready to receive the seed of God's word.

155
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,700
We understand as we, again,

156
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,779
speak of the agricultural analogy

157
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,779
that is here in this verse of Scripture,

158
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,940
we planted a garden this year.

159
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,820
And there's never been a garden in the place

160
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,980
where we've planted a garden,

161
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
at least not for a long, long time,

162
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,420
if there ever had been.

163
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,140
And there was a lot of work to get that ground prepared.

164
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,459
There was a lot of labor that had to go forth.

165
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,140
There were, Joseph and I, he's smiling up here

166
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,399
because he was the one that was there with me working,

167
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,459
and I mean, it was labor, it was work.

168
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,299
Why?

169
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:01,700
Because I couldn't just go out there

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,619
and throw down some seeds and expect

171
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,260
that they would take root

172
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,299
and they would produce some level of fruit for us.

173
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:11,820
No, the ground had to be prepared.

174
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,739
The ground had to be plowed up.

175
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,660
There was work that needed to be done.

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,899
By the way, I couldn't just start with plowing.

177
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,700
I mean, there was a lot that had to be done

178
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,299
in preparing that soil.

179
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,579
And then once the preparations were completed,

180
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,739
we could then plant the seeds, plant the plants,

181
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,660
and then reap a harvest.

182
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,659
But we understand this agricultural analogy,

183
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,500
and we begin to think about our own hearts

184
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,179
and desiring that we'd have hearts

185
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,179
that are tender toward the things of God.

186
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,460
Look over, if you will, in the book of 2 Chronicles

187
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,900
in chapter 34.

188
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,580
In 2 Chronicles chapter 34, God speaks to us

189
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,900
about one of the kings of Judah,

190
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,900
and really, Josiah here in this passage of Scripture,

191
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,820
what a great man of God,

192
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,979
what a great leader for the nation of Judah,

193
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:05,900
the great revival that took place under his leadership.

194
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,260
We find that it's in this portion of Scripture

195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,020
in 2 Chronicles 34 that God gives us

196
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,260
some insight to the man Josiah.

197
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,500
And of course, we know that he was just a boy

198
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,700
when he began to reign.

199
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,619
And he began to reign during a time in Judah's history

200
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:25,580
of great wickedness and great depravity

201
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,539
and idol worship.

202
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,979
And we find that now, Josiah comes to the place

203
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:34,659
and he gets busy and he begins to serve God.

204
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,780
And by the way, we ought never overlook

205
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,940
the youth in our church.

206
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,140
I was praying this morning,

207
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,500
I was sitting here on the platform,

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,460
I got some sunburn, so I was sitting, not kneeling.

209
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,099
And, but God's okay with that, amen?

210
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,780
And I was sitting here praying early this morning,

211
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,099
and I was praying for each one of you

212
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:55,700
by name this morning and praying that God would work

213
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,539
in our hearts and in our lives.

214
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,179
And I began to pray for the young people

215
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,020
as they sit.

216
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,880
near the front and I began to pray that God would use them

217
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,340
and maybe they would be the catalyst

218
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,700
that God would use to bring some revival.

219
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,540
It was just a little lad that gave his lunch

220
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,260
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

221
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,460
And sometimes if we're not careful,

222
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,340
we can despise little things, we can despise young,

223
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
but we find here that while he was young,

224
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,940
he began to, as he had a heart for God,

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,500
he began to do the work of God.

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,820
And the Bible tells us in verse number 14

227
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,900
of 2 Chronicles 34 that he had given the instruction

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,500
with regard to the work and to repair the house of the Lord

229
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,380
and it says that when they brought out the money

230
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,580
that was brought into the house of the Lord,

231
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,540
Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord

232
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,100
given by Moses.

233
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,780
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe,

234
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,940
I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord.

235
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,140
And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan

236
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,520
and Shaphan carried the book to the king.

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,600
This is Josiah and it brought the king word back again

238
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,280
saying all that was committed to thy servants, they do it.

239
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,040
And they have gathered together the money

240
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
that was found in the house of the Lord

241
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers

242
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,200
and the hand of the workmen.

243
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,480
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king saying,

244
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book.

245
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,360
And notice the Bible tells us in verse number 18

246
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,840
that Shaphan read it, the book that was found

247
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,440
in the house of the Lord before the king.

248
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,600
We know the book, the Bible tells us in verse number 14

249
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,440
that the book that was found was of the law of the Lord

250
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,280
given by Moses.

251
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,440
And we find that he's using the word of God.

252
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,840
He's beginning to read the word of God to the king.

253
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,480
Now the king has already been doing some great things,

254
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
has he not?

255
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,160
I mean, he's already given some instruction

256
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,500
with regard to repairing the house of the Lord

257
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,680
and so on and so forth.

258
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,280
In fact, in the very carrying out of those instructions

259
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
is where they find the word of God.

260
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
Shaphan begins to read the word of God.

261
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm thankful this morning that God's word is powerful.

262
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,840
No doubt this man had a heart that was prepared to receive.

263
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,360
We see in verse number 19 it says,

264
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,080
and it came to pass when the king heard the words

265
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,440
of the law that he rent his clothes.

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,960
You say, well, that's not very kingly.

267
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,520
God's word impacted him.

268
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,920
The Bible says that the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahiakim,

269
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,320
the son of Shaphan and Abdon, the son of Micah,

270
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,840
and Shaphan the scribe and Esaias, servant of the king,

271
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,080
saying, go inquire the Lord for me

272
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,200
and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah

273
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,480
concerning the words of the book that is found.

274
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,360
For great is the wrath of the Lord

275
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,520
that is poured out upon us

276
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,000
because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
to do after all that is written in this book.

278
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,220
You find that not only did he hear the word of God,

279
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
but he responded to the word of God.

280
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,820
He responded in humility and in brokenness,

281
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,380
and he begins to give instruction

282
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,500
with regard to inquiring of the Lord

283
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,700
to determine what it was that would transpire

284
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,540
because of the rebellion, because of the sin of the people.

285
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,460
And I want you to skip down, if you will,

286
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,020
in verse number 26, and it says,

287
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,740
and ask for the king of Judah,

288
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,100
speaking here again about Josiah,

289
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,300
who sent you to inquire of the Lord.

290
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,060
So shall you say unto him,

291
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,780
thus saith the Lord God of Israel

292
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,660
concerning the words which thou hast heard.

293
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Then notice verse 27, because thine heart was tender,

294
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,820
because thine heart was tender,

295
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,420
and thou didst humble thyself before God

296
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,620
when thou heardest his words against this place

297
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,220
and against the inhabitants thereof,

298
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,820
and humblest thyself before me,

299
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,700
and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me,

300
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,060
I have even heard thee also, saith the Lord.

301
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,300
He says, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers,

302
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,820
and thou shalt be gathered to the grave in peace.

303
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,900
That's a huge blessing for Josiah.

304
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,340
He says, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil

305
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,260
that I will bring upon this place.

306
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,300
He was spared from that.

307
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,900
Isn't that amazing?

308
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,300
And upon the inhabitants of the same,

309
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,980
so they brought the king word again.

310
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,940
And so you notice that because of his response,

311
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,780
it says, because in verse 27, thine heart was tender.

312
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,180
And that was the key, having that tender heart,

313
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,060
it then led to his humility before the Lord

314
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,820
when he heard the words of God.

315
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,420
And the Bible tells us that he did rend his clothes,

316
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,140
but he also wept before the Lord

317
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,700
according to verse number 27.

318
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,660
And we find how he responded with that heart

319
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,940
that was tender.

320
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,060
Begin to think about our heart

321
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,340
and breaking up that fallow ground again.

322
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,980
This time to plow in order that we would have our hearts

323
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,100
prepared to receive the seed of God's word.

324
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,420
You know, on a daily basis,

325
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,380
we need to ensure that our hearts are prepared

326
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,700
to receive the truth of God's word.

327
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,220
We come to the house of God,

328
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,860
we've been praying before each of our services

329
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,460
and really focusing in that prayer time,

330
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,820
that corporate prayer time at the start of our services

331
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,700
that God would move and work in the midst of our service.

332
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,980
It's not a time to pray for the folks that are sick

333
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,220
or the folks that are traveling,

334
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,340
but God in this hour, would you move?

335
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,180
Would you work?

336
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,540
Would you help my heart to be ready to receive

337
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,660
that I might respond to the word of God?

338
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,980
That we enter into the house of God

339
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,380
with a level of anticipation and expectation

340
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,820
that God has a message for me,

341
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,500
that God has truth for me.

342
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,740
By the way, we should enter our time of prayer

343
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,580
in Bible study every day with that same perspective.

344
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,900
That we open our Bibles in the mornings

345
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,140
or whenever it is that you might read your Bible

346
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,260
and you open the word of God and you say,

347
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,460
God, would you speak to my heart?

348
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,860
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

349
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,740
Lord, open thou mine eyes

350
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,420
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

351
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,700
Teach me, Lord.

352
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,380
Help me to respond, Lord,

353
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,880
that I might be a doer of the word and not a hearer only.

354
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,780
That our hearts would be ready.

355
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
Our hearts would be prepared.

356
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,340
We find that the psalmist speaks of this.

357
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,180
It's interesting, Psalm 51

358
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,940
is the great psalm of repentance of David.

359
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,540
Of course, after his sin there with Bathsheba and Uriah.

360
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,100
And it's interesting because a couple of times here

361
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,520
in this portion of scripture,

362
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,920
he speaks about a clean heart and being clean.

363
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,300
And notice with me in Psalm 51 in verse number 10.

364
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,340
Notice as David is praying,

365
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,440
and if you were to read the entirety of the psalm,

366
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
you see his acknowledgement of his sin

367
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,280
and his confession of his sin

368
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,960
in the beginning of this chapter.

369
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,800
And we come to verse number 10 and he says,

370
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,440
create in me a clean heart, O God,

371
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
and renew a right spirit within me.

372
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
He had said this in verse number seven,

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,960
purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean.

374
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,740
He now mentions specifically creating me a clean heart.

375
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,920
There's something about this phraseology

376
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,640
when David is praying and he's saying,

377
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,000
I want a clean heart.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,540
I don't want a dirty heart.

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,880
I don't want a hard heart.

380
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,200
I want a clean heart.

381
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,360
I heard David Gibbs make this statement

382
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,960
that too often the people of God

383
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,940
are content with being cleaner, but not being clean.

384
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,200
The reality is that if you gave me a dirty glass,

385
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,880
and so that's dirty, I need a clean one,

386
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,920
and you just kind of wish it around with some water

387
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,560
and then put it back and say, well, there you go.

388
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
It's cleaner than it was.

389
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,360
It might be true, right?

390
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,040
It may be cleaner than it was,

391
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,400
but I'm still not interested in drinking my water

392
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,660
or my sweet tea from that particular glass.

393
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,920
I'd prefer that my glass is clean.

394
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,200
You ever go to a restaurant and you got a fork that's dirty?

395
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,600
Some people just take that fork that's dirty

396
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,960
and they just take out the napkin

397
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,840
and they just kind of,

398
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,000
no, man, I want a clean one, amen?

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,320
I don't want it to just be a little cleaner.

400
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,360
I don't want just the hard stuff plucked off,

401
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,520
you know what I'm saying?

402
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,920
You ever been in a restaurant and you had that happen?

403
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Come on, man, I want it clean.

404
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,800
Joseph wants to bring his own, amen, right?

405
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
He wants to just bring his own silverware.

406
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
He's not interested in eating off something

407
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,200
that somebody else ate off of.

408
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,200
And listen, create in me a clean heart.

409
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Not just cleaner, but clean.

410
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,080
Think about that.

411
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
The heart, plow, it's time to plow.

412
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,960
Break up your fallow ground.

413
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,760
Notice what he says in verse 17.

414
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,520
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,

415
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,080
a broken and a contrite heart.

416
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Oh God, thou wilt not despise.

417
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,920
Notice how he describes it in verse 17

418
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,880
as a broken and contrite heart.

419
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,160
David, in this particular psalm,

420
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,080
he's broken over his sin.

421
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,239
By the way, it should not just be the consequences

422
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,400
of our sin that should cause us to be broken.

423
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,040
It should be the fact that we've offended a holy God.

424
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,000
Against Thee and Thee only have I done this wickedness.

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
Have I sinned?

426
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,600
I've done this evil in Thy sight.

427
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
And sometimes if we're not careful,

428
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,320
we can be broken over the consequences of our sin,

429
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,119
but not really broken over the fact

430
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,000
that we've offended a holy God.

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,679
This morning, we find that the instruction of Hosea

432
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,280
to these that he's writing to

433
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,160
contains with it this admonition

434
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,760
to break up your fallow ground.

435
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,480
It's just time to plow.

436
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,679
If we're gonna get on this pathway to revival.

437
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,959
We've acknowledged the need for revival.

438
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,319
So, okay, we acknowledge, we agree,

439
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,359
we wanna get on the path,

440
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,859
we wanna embark on this journey.

441
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,959
Starts with the heart.

442
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,159
Plow up.

443
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,639
Break up your fallow ground.

444
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,999
Notice number two, it's time to plant.

445
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,319
It's time to plant.

446
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,839
You know, it really doesn't do a whole lot of good

447
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,639
to plow up agriculturally,

448
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,559
if we're speaking of the agricultural analogy

449
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,719
that's being used here

450
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,819
in this passage of Scripture in Hosea 10.

451
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,819
It doesn't do a whole lot of good to plow

452
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:32,699
and break up the fallow ground and then leave it, right?

453
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,619
Some of you know, with our garden this year,

454
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:39,099
I started a little bit early,

455
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,459
earlier than I was supposed to,

456
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,859
and I was trying to get that thing ready,

457
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,139
and then I broke my finger,

458
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,079
and then I couldn't do anything.

459
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,219
I couldn't grab the shovel, I couldn't grab the rake,

460
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:49,979
I couldn't grab the rototiller, I couldn't do anything.

461
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,419
And so guess what started to happen in that place

462
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,259
that we had put apart to prepare for a garden?

463
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:59,059
Some things started growing in it,

464
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,979
and they weren't things that I planted in it, right?

465
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,419
Those things were weeds.

466
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,979
Isn't it amazing how quickly those things can grow?

467
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,179
And all of that work that then had to cease,

468
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,779
you started to see all of this stuff creep in.

469
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,699
And see, when we break up our fallow ground,

470
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,699
when we plow, then it's time to plant,

471
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,539
it's time to get the seed, the seed of God's Word.

472
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,179
We see that the Bible says here in Hosea 10,

473
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,019
in verse number 12,

474
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,899
sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy.

475
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,479
We understand that sowing and reaping is a law of nature.

476
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,059
We understand that God has given throughout His Word

477
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,659
this truth of sowing and reaping,

478
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:46,559
and we see it in nature, we see it in our own lives,

479
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,739
and we find here that it's necessary, it's important,

480
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:53,459
it's imperative that we are sowing good seed.

481
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:59,419
He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness.

482
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,859
And then what are you gonna reap?

483
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,779
He says, reap in mercy.

484
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,499
It's a great contrast that we see in verse number 13.

485
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:08,099
It says, ye have plowed wickedness,

486
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,179
ye have reaped iniquity.

487
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,179
What a contrast in verse 13 from verse number 12,

488
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,699
as the instruction is being provided to the people of God

489
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:21,059
with regard to the procedure that they're to follow,

490
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,419
not only of breaking up that fallow ground,

491
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,979
but it's time to plant, it's time to sow that good seed.

492
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,039
Notice in the book of Galatians, again,

493
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,879
we're familiar with this text of Scripture.

494
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:33,939
There's great truth here with regard to this principle

495
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,839
of sowing and reaping in Galatians chapter six,

496
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,339
verses seven and eight.

497
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,979
And we look at what is given to us here

498
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:45,259
in this New Testament epistle.

499
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,379
We find that Paul, under the inspiration

500
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,619
of the Holy Spirit of God, begins by saying,

501
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,699
be not deceived.

502
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,799
You will find that type of terminology on occasion

503
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:58,859
throughout the Word of God.

504
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,259
You'll find throughout the Word of God at times

505
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:03,019
where you'll see beware.

506
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,359
And I find in my own life, personally,

507
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,539
as I come to a verse of Scripture that says,

508
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,699
be not deceived, my antenna, so to speak,

509
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:14,059
kinda is a little bit more in tune with what's going on.

510
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,879
Why?

511
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:17,139
Because the reality is that if God prefaces

512
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:19,539
what He's going to say with be not deceived,

513
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,339
the reality is that many must be deceived

514
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,619
with this thinking.

515
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,619
And so he says, be not deceived.

516
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:31,259
God is not mocked.

517
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:37,939
What sober man soweth, that shall he also reap.

518
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,339
Be not deceived.

519
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,859
God is not mocked.

520
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,939
It's a law that God has established.

521
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:50,819
He gives further insight to this truth

522
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,779
in verse number eight.

523
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:57,179
He that soweth to his flesh

524
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,019
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

525
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,059
Now, I hope that we're not interested

526
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,699
in that first part of verse number eight.

527
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,419
I don't wanna reap corruption.

528
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,819
Do you?

529
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,019
No, thank you.

530
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,019
Well, so he that soweth to his flesh

531
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,500
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

532
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,619
Now, we like that word shall when it's in Romans 10, 13.

533
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,579
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

534
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,859
shall be saved.

535
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,299
And then we say something like this,

536
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,899
it doesn't mean that you might be saved,

537
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,299
doesn't mean that you could be saved.

538
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,660
Man, it is certain, it is absolute, you shall be saved.

539
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,179
And then all of a sudden we read the same word

540
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,779
somewhere else and we say, well.

541
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,259
God says he that soweth to his flesh

542
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,220
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

543
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:50,019
That's negative, but look at the positive

544
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,699
at the end of verse number eight.

545
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,339
But he that soweth to the spirit

546
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:58,579
shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

547
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,899
He then says, let us not be weary in well-doing,

548
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,859
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

549
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,380
You know, it's possible to become weary,

550
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,619
begin to see things that are taking place in our world

551
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:12,380
and begin to think that maybe our efforts

552
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
aren't really worth it.

553
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,259
The reality is that right now we're at a place

554
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,459
where we're hollies out there picking tomatoes

555
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,899
almost every day.

556
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:22,299
But you know, that didn't happen overnight.

557
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,220
There's a truth of sowing and reaping

558
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,940
that it's not immediate.

559
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,739
And he says in verse number nine,

560
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,419
let us not be weary in well-doing,

561
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:37,539
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not,

562
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,220
that we persevere, that we continue on.

563
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,100
And we think about this truth of this sowing

564
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,019
to yourselves in righteousness and it's time to plant.

565
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,459
It was J. Vernon McGee that made this statement.

566
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,779
He said, unfortunately, in his experience

567
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:56,739
that too many of God's people would spend six days a week

568
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,820
sowing seeds of wickedness and then they'd show up

569
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,100
to church on Sunday and they would pray for crop failure.

570
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,739
You just let that sink in just for a moment.

571
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,139
He said for six days they would sow seeds of wickedness.

572
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,779
Then they'd show up to church

573
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,380
and they'd pray for crop failure.

574
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,179
But God says be not deceived.

575
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,179
God is not mocked.

576
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,259
Whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

577
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:26,299
And we find this morning that as we begin

578
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:30,579
to think about this process, this pathway to revival,

579
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,299
it starts with preparing my heart,

580
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,579
breaking up our fallow ground,

581
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,299
having a heart that is tender and ready to receive

582
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,820
that as we open the word of God.

583
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,299
By the way, let me say this.

584
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,500
We don't need to wait until September 18th to have revival.

585
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,899
Revival is not something that's just on a calendar.

586
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,820
We have a revival meeting that's on the calendar

587
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,459
on September the 18th or the 21st

588
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,339
and we have a special guest speaker that's coming.

589
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:57,459
But the reality is that you, we can have revival.

590
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,459
I can have revival today.

591
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:02,739
We can have that revival in our lives

592
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:04,619
where God has brought his people,

593
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,899
he's brought us as individuals back

594
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,299
to that place of spiritual health.

595
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,299
We begin to plant those good seeds.

596
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:19,779
Begin to plant so to the spirit,

597
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,539
as he says in Galatians 6 and verse number eight,

598
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,899
so shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

599
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,899
You say, well, I'm just not seeing any of the results.

600
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:33,299
Takes time.

601
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,019
You don't plant today and reap tomorrow.

602
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,739
Now, sometimes the fruit comes faster than other times.

603
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,419
In fact, if you're to plant some fruit trees,

604
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,339
they take a whole lot longer to produce fruit

605
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,259
than some vegetables,

606
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:50,779
vegetable plants that you can plant, right?

607
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:53,940
And we see those laws in nature.

608
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,859
And so we find here that it's time to plow

609
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,220
back to Hosea 10, it's time to plant.

610
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,380
Let me say this, it's time to pursue.

611
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,220
It says this in verse number 12,

612
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,459
for it is time to seek the Lord

613
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,859
till he come and reign righteousness upon you.

614
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,699
I want you to notice that phrase when he says,

615
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:20,739
it is time to seek the Lord, the idea of pursuing the Lord.

616
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:22,179
I would say this, that there are many things

617
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,899
in our world today, many things in your life today,

618
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,699
many things in my life today that are competing

619
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:32,619
for our attention, competing for our pursuit, right?

620
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,580
A lot of things.

621
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:38,859
But we must be laser focused on pursuing our God.

622
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,380
I mean, laser focused.

623
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,339
There are a lot of distractions,

624
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,779
a lot of things that are gonna come

625
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,899
and try to gain our attention to pursue this

626
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:50,500
and pursue that and pursue this thing over here.

627
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,820
And oftentimes when we're pursuing those things,

628
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,099
we find that those things are just temporal things.

629
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,539
They're things that just fade away.

630
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,260
And it could be our lifelong pursuit.

631
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,979
And we find out that it doesn't bring the joy

632
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,219
or happiness that we thought it would bring.

633
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,260
How many people have had that testimony?

634
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,659
In fact, Holly was asking me last night,

635
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,419
there was a, we were talking a little bit

636
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,320
about college football and she asked me this question.

637
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,020
She said, well, how many of these college players

638
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,940
actually make it to the NFL?

639
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,179
And I said, it's probably about 1% or less.

640
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,339
She said, are you kidding me?

641
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,559
She said it was a lot higher than that.

642
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,580
But I mean, if you do the math, you just figure it out.

643
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,359
It's one or less percent.

644
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,619
I didn't do a Google search.

645
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,779
Google knows everything.

646
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,659
But I just kind of did the math in my head

647
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:35,979
and tried to figure it out.

648
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:36,820
But you.

649
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:44,580
Just work how they are.

650
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,619
She said, so why are they doing this?

651
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,580
That's what she asked me.

652
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,260
She doesn't understand sports a whole lot, right?

653
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,020
And doesn't like sports a whole lot.

654
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,960
But that was her question.

655
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,039
And the reality is that we could ask ourselves

656
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,219
the question of ourselves.

657
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:00,619
Why am I pursuing what I'm pursuing?

658
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:03,819
Why am I doing what I'm doing?

659
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,779
And we think about this truth this morning

660
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,739
of seeking the Lord, of pursuing Him,

661
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,499
and understand there are all sorts of things

662
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,859
that will vie for our attention,

663
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,939
that are competing for our pursuit,

664
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,939
that I must be laser focused on pursuing the Lord.

665
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:18,859
And let me say this this morning,

666
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,299
we are not pursuing the blessings.

667
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,019
We're pursuing God.

668
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,759
There's a great difference.

669
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,759
So often what happens if we're not careful

670
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,599
is we begin to lead and live our lives in such a way

671
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,799
that maybe we're just seeking the blessing,

672
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,959
maybe we're just seeking the blessing from God

673
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,199
instead of seeking God.

674
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,359
I'm thankful for God's blessing,

675
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,699
but you understand this morning

676
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:49,839
that God is worthy of our pursuit

677
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,859
without regard of the blessing.

678
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,919
He is worthy.

679
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,839
Let me say it this way,

680
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,939
He's worthy of our service

681
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:01,079
without the blessing of our service.

682
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,919
Amen?

683
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,439
And if we're not careful,

684
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,719
there are times in which we think maybe

685
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,279
that we could manipulate the hand of God,

686
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,039
that if I do these certain things,

687
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,079
if I do this certain thing,

688
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,839
that it means it's going to result in this way.

689
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,159
And the reality is that God is sovereign

690
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,759
and God has a plan and God has a purpose.

691
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,019
And it doesn't, we cannot manipulate God,

692
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,839
but we must still live in such a way

693
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,319
that we're pleasing God.

694
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,759
Does that make sense this morning?

695
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,319
Because when I want to please God,

696
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,679
listen, this morning, God is good.

697
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,539
Was God good in the life of Job?

698
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:38,999
Sure he was.

699
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,919
But did Job lose everything?

700
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,479
Yeah.

701
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,639
Yeah.

702
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,039
But God was still good.

703
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,619
Was God good in the life of,

704
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,439
we can begin to enlist all sorts of people.

705
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:52,279
How about Paul and Silas?

706
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,399
They're on a missionary journey.

707
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,999
Bringing the gospel to Philippi.

708
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,959
Right?

709
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,359
They're serving God.

710
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,159
They're doing what God's called them to do.

711
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,719
And then they get beaten.

712
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,859
They get imprisoned.

713
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:05,959
You say, yeah, but the,

714
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,080
the Lord sent an earthquake and delivered them.

715
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,279
I understand.

716
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
But they still got beaten and imprisoned.

717
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,839
That's more than I've gotten.

718
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:19,039
How about Isaiah?

719
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,639
If you read the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter,

720
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,839
the hall of faith chapter that we often refer to it as,

721
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,720
we see great triumphs in Hebrews chapter number 11.

722
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,440
And we can look at Hebrews 11

723
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,039
and we can read of those triumphs

724
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,639
and we can read of, by faith,

725
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,039
this particular hero of the faith did this

726
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,119
and this one did this and this one did this.

727
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,440
But we come to the end of Hebrews chapter 11

728
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,879
and we read what the Bible says

729
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
and others, in verse 36,

730
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,720
had trial of cool mockings and scourgings.

731
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,399
Yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.

732
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,599
I mean, it's exciting to read about Daniel

733
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,639
in the den of lions.

734
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:08,519
Exciting to read about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

735
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,919
in the fiery furnace.

736
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,639
But you read of these others,

737
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:15,239
the Bible says in verse 37, they were stoned.

738
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,479
They were stoned.

739
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Think about Stephen in Acts chapter number seven.

740
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,839
Was Stephen not doing what he was supposed to do?

741
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,000
No, man, he was preaching.

742
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,440
And he was preaching a powerful message.

743
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,080
The people were under conviction.

744
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,080
They lashed out at him, they stoned him.

745
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,799
Others that were stoned, notice this,

746
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,720
they were sawn asunder.

747
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,720
History would tell us that Isaiah faced such a death.

748
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,199
The prophet Isaiah saw God high, holy,

749
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,919
and lifted up, preached faithfully.

750
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,519
Listen, we're not pursuing the blessing.

751
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,799
We're pursuing God.

752
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:02,199
And as we pursue God, it is within his sovereign right

753
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:06,159
on what he allows to happen in our lives

754
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,479
and how he will use those circumstances in our lives

755
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:13,159
for the purpose of bringing glory and honor to himself.

756
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:17,440
John 11 in our Sunday school lesson this morning.

757
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,519
And the reality is that as we seek God,

758
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,839
that we understand that we're seeking and serving him.

759
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,919
He is worthy, he is God Almighty.

760
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,079
Can you imagine that the God of the universe

761
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:36,839
would even allow us to seek or to serve him?

762
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,399
If we seek him with all of our heart,

763
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,479
he should be found in us.

764
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:44,079
You think about that, that we can have that communion

765
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,399
with God Almighty as we seek him, as we seek him.

766
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,720
Notice what the psalmist says,

767
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,959
turn to Psalm chapter 42, if you will.

768
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:55,760
Look at the analogy that the psalmist uses here,

769
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
and this is a great truth,

770
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,440
and I hope that, one, that we could look at our own lives

771
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,000
and we could say, yes, it's in this manner

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,919
that I want to seek the Lord and to pursue my God.

773
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,919
And we find that in Psalm 42, is this not on?

774
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,559
Jim's back there telling me this is not on.

775
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,239
Somebody's gonna put some bad batteries

776
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,079
in my thing up here.

777
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,479
Dean, is that you?

778
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,760
Dean's not even in here, amen.

779
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,479
I'm gonna change the batteries real quick.

780
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,000
Stand by, commercial break.

781
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,479
Jim?

782
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
No, no good?

783
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,639
Pulpit mic.

784
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,559
Just use the pulpit mic, amen.

785
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,559
All right, we'll get rid of this thing,

786
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,160
and let me just use the pulpit mic.

787
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,519
That means I can't move.

788
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,880
All right, Psalm 42, look at verses one and two.

789
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,720
The Bible says this.

790
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,040
As the heart panteth after the water brooks,

791
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,040
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

792
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,119
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.

793
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,720
When shall I come and appear before God?

794
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,479
Notice the imagery of verse number one of Psalm 42.

795
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:09,160
As the heart panteth after the water brooks.

796
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,799
You think about the imagery that is used here

797
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,799
in an animal that has not had the quenching of its thirst,

798
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,119
an animal that's running and desiring,

799
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,279
and it says, as the heart panteth after the water brooks,

800
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:28,279
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

801
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,720
Have you ever been thirsty?

802
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,040
Have you ever been hungry?

803
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,600
You know, in America, we say we're hungry.

804
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,799
We just ate like a few hours ago.

805
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:38,839
You know what I'm saying?

806
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:42,000
Your kids sometimes will say, I'm starving.

807
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,079
Your husband sometimes will say,

808
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,559
all the ladies, I'm starving, what's for dinner, right?

809
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,239
And we, listen, the reality is that

810
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,880
we've not really known hunger, most of us, right?

811
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,639
Like some in the world have known hunger.

812
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,199
You ever been in a position where you're just,

813
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,359
you feel like you're parched, you just need a drink.

814
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,079
You just need something to quench your thirst.

815
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,679
The psalmist says, in that manner,

816
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,639
that's how I am pursuing God.

817
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:23,119
So panteth my soul after thee, O God.

818
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,600
When's the last time, I just need God's word.

819
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,399
It doesn't matter what else is going on.

820
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,359
I just need God's word.

821
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,040
Because when we need that drink,

822
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,799
when we need that sustenance,

823
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,000
there's something that comes in to distract us

824
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,399
and we say, hold on, I need to do this first.

825
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,479
I need a drink.

826
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:50,279
I just wonder of our pursuit of God.

827
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,000
How are we longing for God?

828
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,399
When we get up on Sunday morning

829
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,279
and we get to go to church today,

830
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,959
we get to fellowship with the believers today,

831
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,559
we get to worship God today,

832
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,479
we get to hear from the word of God,

833
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:11,359
God has a message for me.

834
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,880
Man, I can't wait to get there.

835
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,239
Because I'm longing for God.

836
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,239
My devotions daily, what is it that would distract us

837
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,399
from seeking God and saying, I'm pursuing God.

838
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,880
I just want to get into his word.

839
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,599
I just want God to show me and reveal himself to me

840
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,760
and help me.

841
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
And I'm longing for that.

842
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,520
We find that here as we begin to think about

843
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
this seeking the Lord, this pursuit of God,

844
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,599
again, being laser focused and understanding

845
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,200
how desperately we need him.

846
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,919
A missionary from Asia came to the United States

847
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:58,000
several years ago and said, I don't know the missionary.

848
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,919
I don't know the pastor that gave the story.

849
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,880
But I read that after being in the United States

850
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,080
for a few weeks, the pastor that had kind of

851
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,359
took him around and introduced him to some friends

852
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,960
and tried to raise some support in different things,

853
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,000
the pastor inquired what he thought

854
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,839
about the American church.

855
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
And this man from the other side of the world said,

856
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,900
I'm amazed at how much you can accomplish without God.

857
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,659
And that stunned the pastor.

858
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,400
He said, all of your programs, all of your,

859
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,239
and he just began to listen.

860
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,640
He said, I'm not trying to criticize.

861
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,640
I'm just giving an answer to the question that you asked.

862
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,739
I'm amazed at how much you can do without God.

863
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:56,440
But the reality is that if we understand biblically

864
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,239
without him, we can do nothing.

865
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:04,259
And what needs to happen in our lives when we think about this pursuit of God is we must

866
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:11,399
come to a place where we recognize how desperately we need God.

867
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:17,439
And with that same level of desperateness of seeking that drink to quench a thirst or

868
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:24,239
that sustenance to quench a hunger pain, that we say spiritually, I have that level of desperation

869
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,359
to seek God, to minister to my spirit and to my soul.

870
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,559
I need God.

871
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,759
And I'm seeking God.

872
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:40,839
I'm not just seeking a blessing from God, I'm seeking God.

873
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:45,759
Paul said this in Colossians 3, if you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which

874
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:49,239
are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

875
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:53,719
Set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth.

876
00:40:53,719 --> 00:41:01,119
For you're dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.

877
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,319
The kingdom of God is not going to advance by our church becoming filled with men.

878
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,399
But can I tell you for a long time, that's really been our goal.

879
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:15,959
Our goal in our churches for a number of generations has been we've got to fill the church house,

880
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,919
fill the church house, fill the church house.

881
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:25,159
And I'm not saying that that's a bad goal, reaching people with the gospel.

882
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:31,619
In fact, he told us in John 15 in the same passage where he said that without him we

883
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,639
can do nothing, he said, herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit.

884
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,279
So we understand that God is glorified as we bear fruit.

885
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:46,319
But the reality is that the kingdom of God is not going to advance just by our churches

886
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:54,359
being filled with men, but by the individuals in our churches becoming filled with God.

887
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:03,599
And as we as individuals in our churches are filled with God, the result of that is that

888
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,719
we'll be reaching people with the gospel.

889
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,119
The result of that is that the church house will be filled up.

890
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,399
But that's not the number one goal.

891
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:17,599
The number one goal is that I'm filled with God.

892
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,839
Be filled with the spirit.

893
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,479
We spoke of that last Sunday evening and the importance of that truth.

894
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:28,279
There's a great contrast in Hosea 10 as we wrap up this morning.

895
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:33,399
In Hosea 10 verses 12 and 13, there's a great contrast between those two verses of scripture.

896
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:39,879
And we find that the contrast is provided to us and we find that really in verse number

897
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:44,439
12, the prophet of God is telling them that they need a different path than the one in

898
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,799
which they've journeyed on.

899
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:52,719
The path in which they've been on is given to us in verse number 13 and he says, no,

900
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,719
you need a different path.

901
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,099
And as we would begin to consider and really conclude this message this morning on this

902
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,559
preparation for revival miniseries, this pathway to revival, we must look at the contrast here.

903
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,879
He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground

904
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:15,559
for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

905
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,879
Notice what they have been doing.

906
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:23,999
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lies

907
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:27,079
because thou didst trust.

908
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:34,559
Notice these words, in thy way, thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty

909
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,559
men.

910
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,199
Solomon said, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in Proverbs 3, that we're

911
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:47,919
to lean not on understanding, right, we're to trust in the Lord with all of our hearts.

912
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:52,079
And here the word of God tells us that they were trusting in their own way.

913
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,679
They had plowed wickedness, they had reaped iniquity, they've eaten the fruit of their

914
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,199
lies, they had had a trust, a confidence in the multitude of their mighty men.

915
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:08,079
And we find that here the prophet of God, Hosea, is saying, look, you need to change

916
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,479
your course, you need to get on a different path.

917
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:17,759
If you desire that God would come and rain righteousness upon you, then you need to change

918
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,559
your course, you need to change your path.

919
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,799
As we consider this morning the pathway to revival, we recognize, acknowledge the need

920
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:28,799
for revival.

921
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:37,160
If you weren't here last Sunday, you listened to the message, I believe that it was quite

922
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,519
obvious that there's a need for revival.

923
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,440
And again, it's not just that we point at another denomination, another group of people

924
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,319
and say, look at them, look at all their, no, no, the light of God's word shines on

925
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,319
us.

926
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,919
Say, God, I need revival, God, we need revival.

927
00:44:53,919 --> 00:44:58,880
When we acknowledge that need, what's the pathway to revival?

928
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,199
Three thoughts this morning, it's time to plow.

929
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,399
It's time for God to work.

930
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:07,479
I agree with the psalmist in Psalm 119, 126, but the prophet says, well, there's some things

931
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:08,479
that you need to do.

932
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,399
Number one, you need to plow, break up your fallow ground, plant, sow to yourselves in

933
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:13,399
righteousness.

934
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:21,239
And then we need to pursue, seeking God, not just for a blessing, but seeking God because

935
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,639
he's worthy of our pursuit, because he's a good God, he's a great God.

936
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,119
We're pursuing him.

937
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,699
Next week, we'll have our third message on this thought of the preparation for revival

938
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,119
and ask ourselves this question, am I revival ready?

939
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,239
It'll be wonderful.

940
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,559
Come to church next week already having revival.

941
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,319
I preach a message, are you revival ready?

942
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,039
Man, we're not revival ready, we're having revival, amen?

943
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,639
Because revival is when God brings his people back to spiritual health.

944
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:04,599
This morning, I don't want to just be cleaner, I want to be clean.

945
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:11,720
Preparation for revival, the pathway to revival, there are hindrances, there are hindrances,

946
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,000
many hindrances.

947
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,039
But I hope that we'd clear the hindrances out and say, I'm going to get on that path.

948
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,039
Let's pray together.

949
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:21,199
God, we love you.

950
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:22,599
We thank you for loving us.

951
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,799
We thank you, God, for the opportunity that you've given us to gather together.

952
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,599
We thank you for your word, for the truth of your word.

953
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:40,119
God, we pray that you would, in these few moments, these quiet moments, Lord, of invitation,

954
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:44,919
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would move in hearts and lives.

955
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:48,799
You'd take your word and minister as only you can.

956
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:58,880
I pray that we take the time to respond, that we would not leave here just by checking

957
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:08,119
a box and filling a requirement, quote unquote, but God, that we truly let you have your way.

958
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:15,079
We'd get on this pathway to revival, help us to have hearts that are tender, ready to

959
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,119
receive the seed of your word.

960
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,199
Help us, Lord.

961
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,160
We need you.

962
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,799
Pray that you'd work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

963
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:28,799
Would you stand with me?

964
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:32,199
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

965
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,479
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she plays, the altar is open.

966
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:42,279
Come and ask the Lord to just respond to God, however he's spoken to you this morning.

967
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,039
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
