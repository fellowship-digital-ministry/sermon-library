WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
this portion of scripture this morning.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.440
And we, of course, last week started a mini-series

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.880
on preparation for revival.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.119
And in the message last Sunday morning,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.039
I sought to establish the need for revival.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.719
We looked at the book of Nehemiah in the first chapter,

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.959
and we understood that Nehemiah requested a report,

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.600
he received a report, and his response

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.719
is really what we focused upon,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.680
and how he responded to the report that he'd received.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.680
And I sought to provide you last week

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.040
with a report on the church in America.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.560
And as we began to look at a number of statistics last week,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.639
I believe that it was quite evident

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.919
that we are in need of revival.

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:45.200
I said this, and it's worth repeating,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.639
no longer should we shift the focus

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:52.319
upon another group, another denomination,

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.000
another whatever you want to label somebody as,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.279
in order to expose their sin or their failure.

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:04.440
But rather, we must desire the light of God's Word

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.959
to be focused upon us as individuals,

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.319
and in our local church,

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.639
and acknowledge the need for revival.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
We mention this, that revival, a very simple definition,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.680
is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:25.040
We understand that as we acknowledge

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.720
the need for revival,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.440
that we could sit here this morning,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.279
and we could say, okay, we acknowledge,

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:33.160
we understand, we agree with the truth

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.879
that we need revival, now what?

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:39.080
Thus, we've titled the message this morning,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
The Pathway to Revival.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.040
The Pathway to Revival.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040
And I want you to understand

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.000
at the very beginning of the message this morning

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.080
that the pathway to revival,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.919
there are many hindrances to that pathway.

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.319
We find that there are many things

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.599
that will cause the people of God

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.400
to even perhaps acknowledge the need,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.279
but never step foot on the pathway to revival.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.680
Maybe they consider the cost,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.500
and they say the cost is just too great.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800
They're not really willing to change things.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.559
They're not really willing to pay what the cost is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.679
to truly have revival.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.100
The hindrances to revival are many.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.179
We find that the enemy does not desire

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.279
for the people of God to be revived.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.759
He is perfectly content and satisfied

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.279
with God's people being apathetic and indifferent.

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.080
He is absolutely just perfectly fine

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.240
with the church of God in America being comfortable.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.160
God never called us to comfort.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.839
In fact, He said,

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.279
"'Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.520
"'shall suffer persecution.'"

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.559
We find that we look at the church of the Laodiceans

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.320
referred to there in Revelation chapter number three,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.000
and they were a church that was,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.259
man, they were comfortable.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.240
They had everything that they needed, quote unquote.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.440
They were apathetic and they were indifferent.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.119
They had this perspective that they had need of nothing,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.320
and really even the Lord,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.800
because the Lord was on the outside of the church

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.820
that He bought with His blood, knocking.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.699
This morning, as we think about the pathway to revival,

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.179
we consider the hindrances that are there,

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.419
and we understand that there'll be great difficulty,

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.139
but I hope this morning that we've acknowledged the need

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.179
and we've determined that I wanna get

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.300
on the pathway to revival.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.759
Revival is for the individual.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.940
Let me say this, revival is a work of God.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.380
It is God bringing His people back to spiritual health.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.860
It is a work of God Almighty, and the psalmist said this

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.300
in Psalm 85 in verse number six.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.940
He says, "'Wilt thou,' speaking of the Lord,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.020
"'wilt thou not revive us again?'

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.220
It's a work of God.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.020
We cannot manufacture the work of God.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.339
We ought not ever seek to manufacture the work of God.

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:08.860
We simply desire that God would work,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.179
and this morning, we understand that revival

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.259
is a work of God.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.979
I would say this, we're in a place and a position

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.660
in our lives and in our nation where we come to a place

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.559
of being desperate to see God work.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.859
We're desperate to see God work.

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:30.700
The psalmist said this in Psalm 119 in verse 126.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.700
He said, "'It is time for thee, Lord, to work,

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.700
"'for they have made void thy law.'"

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.540
Think about that phrase.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.420
It is time for thee, Lord, to work.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.059
We are desperate to see God work.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.500
We are desirous to see God work,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.420
and as we think about this pathway to revival,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.619
as we seek to embark on this pathway,

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.559
and we draw our attentions to what the prophet of God

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.019
said in Hosea 10 in verse number 12,

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:05.980
it's a familiar verse of Scripture,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.100
but I want you to notice in verse number 12 of Hosea 10,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.820
notice what the word of God says.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.440
"'Sow to yourselves in righteousness,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.220
"'reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.660
"'for it is time to seek the Lord,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.260
"'till He come and reign righteousness upon you.'"

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.160
Of interest to me in this particular verse of Scripture

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.339
is that little phrase in the middle of the verse

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.660
where it says, "'For it is time to seek the Lord.'"

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.420
We mentioned that the psalmist declared in Psalm 119

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.459
in verse number 126, "'It is time for thee, Lord, to work,'

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.260
but here the prophet of God is saying to the people of God

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.220
that it's time for you to do some things.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.820
And yes, revival is the work of God,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.140
but we ought to be in a position where we are prepared

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.619
for God to send revival.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.619
And as we look at this particular passage of Scripture,

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.500
I'm gonna go a little bit out of order

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.359
of how it's actually worded here in verse number 12,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.640
but I want you to notice as we think about this truth

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.239
of the pathway to revival, I seek to get,

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:16.279
I embark upon this journey, this path to revival,

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.600
I must first of all, I would say this,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.000
it is time to plow, it's time to plow.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.799
Notice the verse of Scripture,

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.519
it says this in the middle of the verse there,

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:29.399
"'Break up your fallow ground.'"

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.799
Break up your fallow ground.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:32.899
We understand the agricultural analogy

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.660
that is being used here by the prophet of God,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.059
and we find that as he's using this agricultural analogy

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.540
that he's seeking to establish spiritual truth,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.220
oftentimes in the Old Testament,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.940
you'll find that the people of God

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.779
had hearts that were hardened,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.500
they had hearts that were not prepared for the word of God,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.899
they were resistant, they were stiff-necked,

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.100
they were rebellious,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.920
and we find that their heart was not right with God.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.359
They would go through the motions many times,

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:01.179
and they would bring their sacrifices,

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.260
and they would say that we fasted,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.179
but God's saying, listen, I'm concerned about your heart.

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:09.500
Your heart is far from Me.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.339
And we find that as we look here

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.660
at this phrase of Scripture where the Bible says,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.339
break up your fallow ground,

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.540
and we begin to think about the importance of our heart

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.459
being ready to receive the truth of the word of God,

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:25.820
being ready to receive the seed of God's word.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.700
We understand as we, again,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.779
speak of the agricultural analogy

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:34.779
that is here in this verse of Scripture,

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:37.940
we planted a garden this year.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.820
And there's never been a garden in the place

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.980
where we've planted a garden,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
at least not for a long, long time,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.420
if there ever had been.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.140
And there was a lot of work to get that ground prepared.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.459
There was a lot of labor that had to go forth.

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:54.140
There were, Joseph and I, he's smiling up here

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.399
because he was the one that was there with me working,

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:59.459
and I mean, it was labor, it was work.

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:00.299
Why?

00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:01.700
Because I couldn't just go out there

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.619
and throw down some seeds and expect

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:05.260
that they would take root

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.299
and they would produce some level of fruit for us.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.820
No, the ground had to be prepared.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.739
The ground had to be plowed up.

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:15.660
There was work that needed to be done.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.899
By the way, I couldn't just start with plowing.

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.700
I mean, there was a lot that had to be done

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.299
in preparing that soil.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.579
And then once the preparations were completed,

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:28.739
we could then plant the seeds, plant the plants,

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:30.660
and then reap a harvest.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.659
But we understand this agricultural analogy,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.500
and we begin to think about our own hearts

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.179
and desiring that we'd have hearts

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.179
that are tender toward the things of God.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.460
Look over, if you will, in the book of 2 Chronicles

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.900
in chapter 34.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.580
In 2 Chronicles chapter 34, God speaks to us

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.900
about one of the kings of Judah,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.900
and really, Josiah here in this passage of Scripture,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.820
what a great man of God,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.979
what a great leader for the nation of Judah,

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:05.900
the great revival that took place under his leadership.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.260
We find that it's in this portion of Scripture

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.020
in 2 Chronicles 34 that God gives us

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.260
some insight to the man Josiah.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.500
And of course, we know that he was just a boy

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.700
when he began to reign.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.619
And he began to reign during a time in Judah's history

00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:25.580
of great wickedness and great depravity

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.539
and idol worship.

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:30.979
And we find that now, Josiah comes to the place

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:34.659
and he gets busy and he begins to serve God.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:37.780
And by the way, we ought never overlook

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.940
the youth in our church.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.140
I was praying this morning,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.500
I was sitting here on the platform,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.460
I got some sunburn, so I was sitting, not kneeling.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.099
And, but God's okay with that, amen?

00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:51.780
And I was sitting here praying early this morning,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.099
and I was praying for each one of you

00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:55.700
by name this morning and praying that God would work

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.539
in our hearts and in our lives.

00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:59.179
And I began to pray for the young people

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.020
as they sit.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.880
near the front and I began to pray that God would use them

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.340
and maybe they would be the catalyst

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.700
that God would use to bring some revival.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.540
It was just a little lad that gave his lunch

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.260
to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.460
And sometimes if we're not careful,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.340
we can despise little things, we can despise young,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.340
but we find here that while he was young,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.940
he began to, as he had a heart for God,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.500
he began to do the work of God.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.820
And the Bible tells us in verse number 14

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.900
of 2 Chronicles 34 that he had given the instruction

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.500
with regard to the work and to repair the house of the Lord

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.380
and it says that when they brought out the money

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.580
that was brought into the house of the Lord,

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.540
Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.100
given by Moses.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.780
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.940
I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.140
And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.520
and Shaphan carried the book to the king.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.600
This is Josiah and it brought the king word back again

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.280
saying all that was committed to thy servants, they do it.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.040
And they have gathered together the money

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.640
that was found in the house of the Lord

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.760
and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.200
and the hand of the workmen.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.480
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king saying,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.600
Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.360
And notice the Bible tells us in verse number 18

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.840
that Shaphan read it, the book that was found

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.440
in the house of the Lord before the king.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.600
We know the book, the Bible tells us in verse number 14

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.440
that the book that was found was of the law of the Lord

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.280
given by Moses.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.440
And we find that he's using the word of God.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.840
He's beginning to read the word of God to the king.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.480
Now the king has already been doing some great things,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.320
has he not?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.160
I mean, he's already given some instruction

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.500
with regard to repairing the house of the Lord

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.680
and so on and so forth.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.280
In fact, in the very carrying out of those instructions

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.360
is where they find the word of God.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.880
Shaphan begins to read the word of God.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.600
I'm thankful this morning that God's word is powerful.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.840
No doubt this man had a heart that was prepared to receive.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.360
We see in verse number 19 it says,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.080
and it came to pass when the king heard the words

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.440
of the law that he rent his clothes.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.960
You say, well, that's not very kingly.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.520
God's word impacted him.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.920
The Bible says that the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahiakim,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.320
the son of Shaphan and Abdon, the son of Micah,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.840
and Shaphan the scribe and Esaias, servant of the king,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080
saying, go inquire the Lord for me

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.200
and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.480
concerning the words of the book that is found.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.360
For great is the wrath of the Lord

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.520
that is poured out upon us

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.000
because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.440
to do after all that is written in this book.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.220
You find that not only did he hear the word of God,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
but he responded to the word of God.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.820
He responded in humility and in brokenness,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.380
and he begins to give instruction

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.500
with regard to inquiring of the Lord

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.700
to determine what it was that would transpire

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.540
because of the rebellion, because of the sin of the people.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.460
And I want you to skip down, if you will,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.020
in verse number 26, and it says,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.740
and ask for the king of Judah,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.100
speaking here again about Josiah,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.300
who sent you to inquire of the Lord.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.060
So shall you say unto him,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.780
thus saith the Lord God of Israel

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.660
concerning the words which thou hast heard.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.660
Then notice verse 27, because thine heart was tender,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.820
because thine heart was tender,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.420
and thou didst humble thyself before God

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.620
when thou heardest his words against this place

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.220
and against the inhabitants thereof,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.820
and humblest thyself before me,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.700
and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.060
I have even heard thee also, saith the Lord.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.300
He says, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.820
and thou shalt be gathered to the grave in peace.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.900
That's a huge blessing for Josiah.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.340
He says, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.260
that I will bring upon this place.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.300
He was spared from that.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.900
Isn't that amazing?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.300
And upon the inhabitants of the same,

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.980
so they brought the king word again.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.940
And so you notice that because of his response,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.780
it says, because in verse 27, thine heart was tender.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.180
And that was the key, having that tender heart,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.060
it then led to his humility before the Lord

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.820
when he heard the words of God.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.420
And the Bible tells us that he did rend his clothes,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.140
but he also wept before the Lord

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.700
according to verse number 27.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.660
And we find how he responded with that heart

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.940
that was tender.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.060
Begin to think about our heart

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.340
and breaking up that fallow ground again.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.980
This time to plow in order that we would have our hearts

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.100
prepared to receive the seed of God's word.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.420
You know, on a daily basis,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.380
we need to ensure that our hearts are prepared

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.700
to receive the truth of God's word.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.220
We come to the house of God,

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.860
we've been praying before each of our services

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.460
and really focusing in that prayer time,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.820
that corporate prayer time at the start of our services

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.700
that God would move and work in the midst of our service.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.980
It's not a time to pray for the folks that are sick

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.220
or the folks that are traveling,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.340
but God in this hour, would you move?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.180
Would you work?

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.540
Would you help my heart to be ready to receive

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.660
that I might respond to the word of God?

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.980
That we enter into the house of God

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.380
with a level of anticipation and expectation

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.820
that God has a message for me,

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.500
that God has truth for me.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.740
By the way, we should enter our time of prayer

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.580
in Bible study every day with that same perspective.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.900
That we open our Bibles in the mornings

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.140
or whenever it is that you might read your Bible

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.260
and you open the word of God and you say,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.460
God, would you speak to my heart?

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.860
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.740
Lord, open thou mine eyes

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.420
that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.700
Teach me, Lord.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.380
Help me to respond, Lord,

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.880
that I might be a doer of the word and not a hearer only.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.780
That our hearts would be ready.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.780
Our hearts would be prepared.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.340
We find that the psalmist speaks of this.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.180
It's interesting, Psalm 51

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.940
is the great psalm of repentance of David.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.540
Of course, after his sin there with Bathsheba and Uriah.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.100
And it's interesting because a couple of times here

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.520
in this portion of scripture,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.920
he speaks about a clean heart and being clean.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.300
And notice with me in Psalm 51 in verse number 10.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.340
Notice as David is praying,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.440
and if you were to read the entirety of the psalm,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.360
you see his acknowledgement of his sin

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.280
and his confession of his sin

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.960
in the beginning of this chapter.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.800
And we come to verse number 10 and he says,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.440
create in me a clean heart, O God,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.240
and renew a right spirit within me.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.160
He had said this in verse number seven,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.960
purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.740
He now mentions specifically creating me a clean heart.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.920
There's something about this phraseology

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.640
when David is praying and he's saying,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.000
I want a clean heart.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.540
I don't want a dirty heart.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.880
I don't want a hard heart.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.200
I want a clean heart.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.360
I heard David Gibbs make this statement

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.960
that too often the people of God

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.940
are content with being cleaner, but not being clean.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.200
The reality is that if you gave me a dirty glass,

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.880
and so that's dirty, I need a clean one,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.920
and you just kind of wish it around with some water

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.560
and then put it back and say, well, there you go.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.240
It's cleaner than it was.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.360
It might be true, right?

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.040
It may be cleaner than it was,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.400
but I'm still not interested in drinking my water

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.660
or my sweet tea from that particular glass.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.920
I'd prefer that my glass is clean.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.200
You ever go to a restaurant and you got a fork that's dirty?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.600
Some people just take that fork that's dirty

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.960
and they just take out the napkin

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.840
and they just kind of,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.000
no, man, I want a clean one, amen?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.320
I don't want it to just be a little cleaner.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.360
I don't want just the hard stuff plucked off,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.520
you know what I'm saying?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.920
You ever been in a restaurant and you had that happen?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.360
Come on, man, I want it clean.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.800
Joseph wants to bring his own, amen, right?

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.840
He wants to just bring his own silverware.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.840
He's not interested in eating off something

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.200
that somebody else ate off of.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.200
And listen, create in me a clean heart.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.840
Not just cleaner, but clean.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.080
Think about that.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.880
The heart, plow, it's time to plow.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.960
Break up your fallow ground.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.760
Notice what he says in verse 17.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.520
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.080
a broken and a contrite heart.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.080
Oh God, thou wilt not despise.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.920
Notice how he describes it in verse 17

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.880
as a broken and contrite heart.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.160
David, in this particular psalm,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.080
he's broken over his sin.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.239
By the way, it should not just be the consequences

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:19.400
of our sin that should cause us to be broken.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.040
It should be the fact that we've offended a holy God.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.000
Against Thee and Thee only have I done this wickedness.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.520
Have I sinned?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.600
I've done this evil in Thy sight.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.200
And sometimes if we're not careful,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.320
we can be broken over the consequences of our sin,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.119
but not really broken over the fact

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:43.000
that we've offended a holy God.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.679
This morning, we find that the instruction of Hosea

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:50.280
to these that he's writing to

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.160
contains with it this admonition

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.760
to break up your fallow ground.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.480
It's just time to plow.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.679
If we're gonna get on this pathway to revival.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:02.959
We've acknowledged the need for revival.

00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:04.319
So, okay, we acknowledge, we agree,

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:05.359
we wanna get on the path,

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:07.859
we wanna embark on this journey.

00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:09.959
Starts with the heart.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.159
Plow up.

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.639
Break up your fallow ground.

00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:14.999
Notice number two, it's time to plant.

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:16.319
It's time to plant.

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:17.839
You know, it really doesn't do a whole lot of good

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.639
to plow up agriculturally,

00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:21.559
if we're speaking of the agricultural analogy

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.719
that's being used here

00:20:22.719 --> 00:20:24.819
in this passage of Scripture in Hosea 10.

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:27.819
It doesn't do a whole lot of good to plow

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:32.699
and break up the fallow ground and then leave it, right?

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:36.619
Some of you know, with our garden this year,

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:39.099
I started a little bit early,

00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:40.459
earlier than I was supposed to,

00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:41.859
and I was trying to get that thing ready,

00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:43.139
and then I broke my finger,

00:20:43.139 --> 00:20:45.079
and then I couldn't do anything.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.219
I couldn't grab the shovel, I couldn't grab the rake,

00:20:47.219 --> 00:20:49.979
I couldn't grab the rototiller, I couldn't do anything.

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:52.419
And so guess what started to happen in that place

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:56.259
that we had put apart to prepare for a garden?

00:20:56.259 --> 00:20:59.059
Some things started growing in it,

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:03.979
and they weren't things that I planted in it, right?

00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:05.419
Those things were weeds.

00:21:05.419 --> 00:21:07.979
Isn't it amazing how quickly those things can grow?

00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:14.179
And all of that work that then had to cease,

00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:16.779
you started to see all of this stuff creep in.

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:20.699
And see, when we break up our fallow ground,

00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:23.699
when we plow, then it's time to plant,

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.539
it's time to get the seed, the seed of God's Word.

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.179
We see that the Bible says here in Hosea 10,

00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:30.019
in verse number 12,

00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:34.899
sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy.

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:39.479
We understand that sowing and reaping is a law of nature.

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:42.059
We understand that God has given throughout His Word

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:43.659
this truth of sowing and reaping,

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:46.559
and we see it in nature, we see it in our own lives,

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:49.739
and we find here that it's necessary, it's important,

00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:53.459
it's imperative that we are sowing good seed.

00:21:54.699 --> 00:21:59.419
He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness.

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:00.859
And then what are you gonna reap?

00:22:00.859 --> 00:22:02.779
He says, reap in mercy.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.499
It's a great contrast that we see in verse number 13.

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:08.099
It says, ye have plowed wickedness,

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:11.179
ye have reaped iniquity.

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:14.179
What a contrast in verse 13 from verse number 12,

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:17.699
as the instruction is being provided to the people of God

00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:21.059
with regard to the procedure that they're to follow,

00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:23.419
not only of breaking up that fallow ground,

00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:26.979
but it's time to plant, it's time to sow that good seed.

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:29.039
Notice in the book of Galatians, again,

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:30.879
we're familiar with this text of Scripture.

00:22:30.879 --> 00:22:33.939
There's great truth here with regard to this principle

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:36.839
of sowing and reaping in Galatians chapter six,

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:38.339
verses seven and eight.

00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:41.979
And we look at what is given to us here

00:22:41.979 --> 00:22:45.259
in this New Testament epistle.

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:47.379
We find that Paul, under the inspiration

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:49.619
of the Holy Spirit of God, begins by saying,

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:52.699
be not deceived.

00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:57.799
You will find that type of terminology on occasion

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:58.859
throughout the Word of God.

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:01.259
You'll find throughout the Word of God at times

00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:03.019
where you'll see beware.

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:05.359
And I find in my own life, personally,

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.539
as I come to a verse of Scripture that says,

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:10.699
be not deceived, my antenna, so to speak,

00:23:10.699 --> 00:23:14.059
kinda is a little bit more in tune with what's going on.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:14.879
Why?

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:17.139
Because the reality is that if God prefaces

00:23:17.139 --> 00:23:19.539
what He's going to say with be not deceived,

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:22.339
the reality is that many must be deceived

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:23.619
with this thinking.

00:23:25.419 --> 00:23:27.619
And so he says, be not deceived.

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:31.259
God is not mocked.

00:23:32.939 --> 00:23:37.939
What sober man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.339
Be not deceived.

00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:45.859
God is not mocked.

00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:47.939
It's a law that God has established.

00:23:47.939 --> 00:23:50.819
He gives further insight to this truth

00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:52.779
in verse number eight.

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:57.179
He that soweth to his flesh

00:23:57.179 --> 00:24:01.019
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:03.059
Now, I hope that we're not interested

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:05.699
in that first part of verse number eight.

00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:07.419
I don't wanna reap corruption.

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:08.819
Do you?

00:24:08.819 --> 00:24:10.019
No, thank you.

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:13.019
Well, so he that soweth to his flesh

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:16.500
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.619
Now, we like that word shall when it's in Romans 10, 13.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.579
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:25.859
shall be saved.

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.299
And then we say something like this,

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.899
it doesn't mean that you might be saved,

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:30.299
doesn't mean that you could be saved.

00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:34.660
Man, it is certain, it is absolute, you shall be saved.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.179
And then all of a sudden we read the same word

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:37.779
somewhere else and we say, well.

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:44.259
God says he that soweth to his flesh

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:46.220
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:24:47.459 --> 00:24:50.019
That's negative, but look at the positive

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:51.699
at the end of verse number eight.

00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:54.339
But he that soweth to the spirit

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:58.579
shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.899
He then says, let us not be weary in well-doing,

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:03.859
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.380
You know, it's possible to become weary,

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.619
begin to see things that are taking place in our world

00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:12.380
and begin to think that maybe our efforts

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.820
aren't really worth it.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.259
The reality is that right now we're at a place

00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:18.459
where we're hollies out there picking tomatoes

00:25:18.459 --> 00:25:19.899
almost every day.

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:22.299
But you know, that didn't happen overnight.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.220
There's a truth of sowing and reaping

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.940
that it's not immediate.

00:25:31.179 --> 00:25:32.739
And he says in verse number nine,

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:34.419
let us not be weary in well-doing,

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:37.539
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not,

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:40.220
that we persevere, that we continue on.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.100
And we think about this truth of this sowing

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.019
to yourselves in righteousness and it's time to plant.

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:49.459
It was J. Vernon McGee that made this statement.

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.779
He said, unfortunately, in his experience

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:56.739
that too many of God's people would spend six days a week

00:25:56.739 --> 00:25:59.820
sowing seeds of wickedness and then they'd show up

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.100
to church on Sunday and they would pray for crop failure.

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:06.739
You just let that sink in just for a moment.

00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:13.139
He said for six days they would sow seeds of wickedness.

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:14.779
Then they'd show up to church

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.380
and they'd pray for crop failure.

00:26:18.259 --> 00:26:20.179
But God says be not deceived.

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:21.179
God is not mocked.

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:24.259
Whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:26:24.259 --> 00:26:26.299
And we find this morning that as we begin

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:30.579
to think about this process, this pathway to revival,

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:33.299
it starts with preparing my heart,

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:35.579
breaking up our fallow ground,

00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:39.299
having a heart that is tender and ready to receive

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:40.820
that as we open the word of God.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.299
By the way, let me say this.

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:45.500
We don't need to wait until September 18th to have revival.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.899
Revival is not something that's just on a calendar.

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:50.820
We have a revival meeting that's on the calendar

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.459
on September the 18th or the 21st

00:26:52.459 --> 00:26:54.339
and we have a special guest speaker that's coming.

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:57.459
But the reality is that you, we can have revival.

00:26:57.459 --> 00:26:59.459
I can have revival today.

00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:02.739
We can have that revival in our lives

00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:04.619
where God has brought his people,

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:06.899
he's brought us as individuals back

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:09.299
to that place of spiritual health.

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:14.299
We begin to plant those good seeds.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:19.779
Begin to plant so to the spirit,

00:27:20.419 --> 00:27:22.539
as he says in Galatians 6 and verse number eight,

00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:25.899
so shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:30.899
You say, well, I'm just not seeing any of the results.

00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:33.299
Takes time.

00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:38.019
You don't plant today and reap tomorrow.

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:42.739
Now, sometimes the fruit comes faster than other times.

00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:44.419
In fact, if you're to plant some fruit trees,

00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:46.339
they take a whole lot longer to produce fruit

00:27:46.339 --> 00:27:48.259
than some vegetables,

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:50.779
vegetable plants that you can plant, right?

00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:53.940
And we see those laws in nature.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.859
And so we find here that it's time to plow

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:58.220
back to Hosea 10, it's time to plant.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.380
Let me say this, it's time to pursue.

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:05.220
It says this in verse number 12,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.459
for it is time to seek the Lord

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:13.859
till he come and reign righteousness upon you.

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.699
I want you to notice that phrase when he says,

00:28:16.699 --> 00:28:20.739
it is time to seek the Lord, the idea of pursuing the Lord.

00:28:20.739 --> 00:28:22.179
I would say this, that there are many things

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:24.899
in our world today, many things in your life today,

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:27.699
many things in my life today that are competing

00:28:27.699 --> 00:28:32.619
for our attention, competing for our pursuit, right?

00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:33.580
A lot of things.

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:38.859
But we must be laser focused on pursuing our God.

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:41.380
I mean, laser focused.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.339
There are a lot of distractions,

00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:44.779
a lot of things that are gonna come

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:47.899
and try to gain our attention to pursue this

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:50.500
and pursue that and pursue this thing over here.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.820
And oftentimes when we're pursuing those things,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.099
we find that those things are just temporal things.

00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:59.539
They're things that just fade away.

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:03.260
And it could be our lifelong pursuit.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.979
And we find out that it doesn't bring the joy

00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:08.219
or happiness that we thought it would bring.

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:11.260
How many people have had that testimony?

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.659
In fact, Holly was asking me last night,

00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:15.419
there was a, we were talking a little bit

00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:17.320
about college football and she asked me this question.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.020
She said, well, how many of these college players

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.940
actually make it to the NFL?

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.179
And I said, it's probably about 1% or less.

00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:25.339
She said, are you kidding me?

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:26.559
She said it was a lot higher than that.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:28.580
But I mean, if you do the math, you just figure it out.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.359
It's one or less percent.

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:31.619
I didn't do a Google search.

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:32.779
Google knows everything.

00:29:32.779 --> 00:29:34.659
But I just kind of did the math in my head

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:35.979
and tried to figure it out.

00:29:35.979 --> 00:29:36.820
But you.

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:44.580
Just work how they are.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.619
She said, so why are they doing this?

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:47.580
That's what she asked me.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.260
She doesn't understand sports a whole lot, right?

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.020
And doesn't like sports a whole lot.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.960
But that was her question.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.039
And the reality is that we could ask ourselves

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:58.219
the question of ourselves.

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:00.619
Why am I pursuing what I'm pursuing?

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:03.819
Why am I doing what I'm doing?

00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:05.779
And we think about this truth this morning

00:30:05.779 --> 00:30:07.739
of seeking the Lord, of pursuing Him,

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.499
and understand there are all sorts of things

00:30:09.499 --> 00:30:11.859
that will vie for our attention,

00:30:11.859 --> 00:30:13.939
that are competing for our pursuit,

00:30:13.939 --> 00:30:16.939
that I must be laser focused on pursuing the Lord.

00:30:16.939 --> 00:30:18.859
And let me say this this morning,

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:22.299
we are not pursuing the blessings.

00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:25.019
We're pursuing God.

00:30:26.219 --> 00:30:28.759
There's a great difference.

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:31.759
So often what happens if we're not careful

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:36.599
is we begin to lead and live our lives in such a way

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:38.799
that maybe we're just seeking the blessing,

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:41.959
maybe we're just seeking the blessing from God

00:30:41.959 --> 00:30:44.199
instead of seeking God.

00:30:44.199 --> 00:30:46.359
I'm thankful for God's blessing,

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:47.699
but you understand this morning

00:30:47.699 --> 00:30:49.839
that God is worthy of our pursuit

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:51.859
without regard of the blessing.

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:53.919
He is worthy.

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:54.839
Let me say it this way,

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:56.939
He's worthy of our service

00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:01.079
without the blessing of our service.

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:01.919
Amen?

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.439
And if we're not careful,

00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:05.719
there are times in which we think maybe

00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:08.279
that we could manipulate the hand of God,

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.039
that if I do these certain things,

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:11.079
if I do this certain thing,

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:13.839
that it means it's going to result in this way.

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:16.159
And the reality is that God is sovereign

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:18.759
and God has a plan and God has a purpose.

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:22.019
And it doesn't, we cannot manipulate God,

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.839
but we must still live in such a way

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:26.319
that we're pleasing God.

00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:28.759
Does that make sense this morning?

00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:30.319
Because when I want to please God,

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:32.679
listen, this morning, God is good.

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:37.539
Was God good in the life of Job?

00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:38.999
Sure he was.

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:40.919
But did Job lose everything?

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:42.479
Yeah.

00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:43.639
Yeah.

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:45.039
But God was still good.

00:31:46.679 --> 00:31:48.619
Was God good in the life of,

00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:50.439
we can begin to enlist all sorts of people.

00:31:50.439 --> 00:31:52.279
How about Paul and Silas?

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.399
They're on a missionary journey.

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.999
Bringing the gospel to Philippi.

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:57.959
Right?

00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.359
They're serving God.

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:01.159
They're doing what God's called them to do.

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:02.719
And then they get beaten.

00:32:02.719 --> 00:32:04.859
They get imprisoned.

00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:05.959
You say, yeah, but the,

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:10.080
the Lord sent an earthquake and delivered them.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.279
I understand.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.440
But they still got beaten and imprisoned.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.839
That's more than I've gotten.

00:32:18.199 --> 00:32:19.039
How about Isaiah?

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:24.639
If you read the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter,

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:28.839
the hall of faith chapter that we often refer to it as,

00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:32.720
we see great triumphs in Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.440
And we can look at Hebrews 11

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.039
and we can read of those triumphs

00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.639
and we can read of, by faith,

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:41.039
this particular hero of the faith did this

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:43.119
and this one did this and this one did this.

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.440
But we come to the end of Hebrews chapter 11

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.879
and we read what the Bible says

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.720
and others, in verse 36,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.720
had trial of cool mockings and scourgings.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.399
Yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:02.599
I mean, it's exciting to read about Daniel

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:05.639
in the den of lions.

00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:08.519
Exciting to read about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.919
in the fiery furnace.

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:12.639
But you read of these others,

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:15.239
the Bible says in verse 37, they were stoned.

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:18.479
They were stoned.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080
Think about Stephen in Acts chapter number seven.

00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:24.839
Was Stephen not doing what he was supposed to do?

00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:27.000
No, man, he was preaching.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.440
And he was preaching a powerful message.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.080
The people were under conviction.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.080
They lashed out at him, they stoned him.

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.799
Others that were stoned, notice this,

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:39.720
they were sawn asunder.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.720
History would tell us that Isaiah faced such a death.

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:48.199
The prophet Isaiah saw God high, holy,

00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:49.919
and lifted up, preached faithfully.

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:53.519
Listen, we're not pursuing the blessing.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:55.799
We're pursuing God.

00:33:57.199 --> 00:34:02.199
And as we pursue God, it is within his sovereign right

00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:06.159
on what he allows to happen in our lives

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:09.479
and how he will use those circumstances in our lives

00:34:09.479 --> 00:34:13.159
for the purpose of bringing glory and honor to himself.

00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:17.440
John 11 in our Sunday school lesson this morning.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.519
And the reality is that as we seek God,

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:26.839
that we understand that we're seeking and serving him.

00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:29.919
He is worthy, he is God Almighty.

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:33.079
Can you imagine that the God of the universe

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:36.839
would even allow us to seek or to serve him?

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:38.399
If we seek him with all of our heart,

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.479
he should be found in us.

00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:44.079
You think about that, that we can have that communion

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:49.399
with God Almighty as we seek him, as we seek him.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:50.720
Notice what the psalmist says,

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.959
turn to Psalm chapter 42, if you will.

00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:55.760
Look at the analogy that the psalmist uses here,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.760
and this is a great truth,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.440
and I hope that, one, that we could look at our own lives

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.000
and we could say, yes, it's in this manner

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.919
that I want to seek the Lord and to pursue my God.

00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:09.919
And we find that in Psalm 42, is this not on?

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.559
Jim's back there telling me this is not on.

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:15.239
Somebody's gonna put some bad batteries

00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:17.079
in my thing up here.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:18.479
Dean, is that you?

00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:19.760
Dean's not even in here, amen.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.479
I'm gonna change the batteries real quick.

00:35:21.479 --> 00:35:23.000
Stand by, commercial break.

00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:29.479
Jim?

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.160
No, no good?

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:34.639
Pulpit mic.

00:35:34.639 --> 00:35:36.559
Just use the pulpit mic, amen.

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:38.559
All right, we'll get rid of this thing,

00:35:38.559 --> 00:35:40.160
and let me just use the pulpit mic.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.519
That means I can't move.

00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:44.880
All right, Psalm 42, look at verses one and two.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.720
The Bible says this.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.040
As the heart panteth after the water brooks,

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.040
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:58.119
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.

00:35:58.119 --> 00:36:00.720
When shall I come and appear before God?

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.479
Notice the imagery of verse number one of Psalm 42.

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:09.160
As the heart panteth after the water brooks.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.799
You think about the imagery that is used here

00:36:11.799 --> 00:36:16.799
in an animal that has not had the quenching of its thirst,

00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:20.119
an animal that's running and desiring,

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:23.279
and it says, as the heart panteth after the water brooks,

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:28.279
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:30.720
Have you ever been thirsty?

00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:34.040
Have you ever been hungry?

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.600
You know, in America, we say we're hungry.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.799
We just ate like a few hours ago.

00:36:37.799 --> 00:36:38.839
You know what I'm saying?

00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:42.000
Your kids sometimes will say, I'm starving.

00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:45.079
Your husband sometimes will say,

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:48.559
all the ladies, I'm starving, what's for dinner, right?

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:51.239
And we, listen, the reality is that

00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:55.880
we've not really known hunger, most of us, right?

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.639
Like some in the world have known hunger.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.199
You ever been in a position where you're just,

00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:06.359
you feel like you're parched, you just need a drink.

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:09.079
You just need something to quench your thirst.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.679
The psalmist says, in that manner,

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:17.639
that's how I am pursuing God.

00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:23.119
So panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.600
When's the last time, I just need God's word.

00:37:29.959 --> 00:37:31.399
It doesn't matter what else is going on.

00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:33.359
I just need God's word.

00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:37.040
Because when we need that drink,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.799
when we need that sustenance,

00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:41.000
there's something that comes in to distract us

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.399
and we say, hold on, I need to do this first.

00:37:43.399 --> 00:37:44.479
I need a drink.

00:37:46.479 --> 00:37:50.279
I just wonder of our pursuit of God.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.000
How are we longing for God?

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.399
When we get up on Sunday morning

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.279
and we get to go to church today,

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.959
we get to fellowship with the believers today,

00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:06.559
we get to worship God today,

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:08.479
we get to hear from the word of God,

00:38:08.479 --> 00:38:11.359
God has a message for me.

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:13.880
Man, I can't wait to get there.

00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:17.239
Because I'm longing for God.

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:22.239
My devotions daily, what is it that would distract us

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.399
from seeking God and saying, I'm pursuing God.

00:38:29.399 --> 00:38:30.880
I just want to get into his word.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.599
I just want God to show me and reveal himself to me

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:34.760
and help me.

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:37.359
And I'm longing for that.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.520
We find that here as we begin to think about

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.640
this seeking the Lord, this pursuit of God,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.599
again, being laser focused and understanding

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:50.200
how desperately we need him.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.919
A missionary from Asia came to the United States

00:38:54.919 --> 00:38:58.000
several years ago and said, I don't know the missionary.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.919
I don't know the pastor that gave the story.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.880
But I read that after being in the United States

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.080
for a few weeks, the pastor that had kind of

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.359
took him around and introduced him to some friends

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:14.960
and tried to raise some support in different things,

00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:19.000
the pastor inquired what he thought

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.839
about the American church.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.119
And this man from the other side of the world said,

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.900
I'm amazed at how much you can accomplish without God.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.659
And that stunned the pastor.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.400
He said, all of your programs, all of your,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.239
and he just began to listen.

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:45.640
He said, I'm not trying to criticize.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.640
I'm just giving an answer to the question that you asked.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.739
I'm amazed at how much you can do without God.

00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:56.440
But the reality is that if we understand biblically

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.239
without him, we can do nothing.

00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:04.259
And what needs to happen in our lives when we think about this pursuit of God is we must

00:40:04.259 --> 00:40:11.399
come to a place where we recognize how desperately we need God.

00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:17.439
And with that same level of desperateness of seeking that drink to quench a thirst or

00:40:17.439 --> 00:40:24.239
that sustenance to quench a hunger pain, that we say spiritually, I have that level of desperation

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:29.359
to seek God, to minister to my spirit and to my soul.

00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:32.559
I need God.

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:33.759
And I'm seeking God.

00:40:33.759 --> 00:40:40.839
I'm not just seeking a blessing from God, I'm seeking God.

00:40:40.839 --> 00:40:45.759
Paul said this in Colossians 3, if you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which

00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:49.239
are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:53.719
Set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth.

00:40:53.719 --> 00:41:01.119
For you're dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.

00:41:01.119 --> 00:41:05.319
The kingdom of God is not going to advance by our church becoming filled with men.

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:11.399
But can I tell you for a long time, that's really been our goal.

00:41:11.399 --> 00:41:15.959
Our goal in our churches for a number of generations has been we've got to fill the church house,

00:41:15.959 --> 00:41:17.919
fill the church house, fill the church house.

00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:25.159
And I'm not saying that that's a bad goal, reaching people with the gospel.

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:31.619
In fact, he told us in John 15 in the same passage where he said that without him we

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:36.639
can do nothing, he said, herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit.

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:41.279
So we understand that God is glorified as we bear fruit.

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:46.319
But the reality is that the kingdom of God is not going to advance just by our churches

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:54.359
being filled with men, but by the individuals in our churches becoming filled with God.

00:41:54.359 --> 00:42:03.599
And as we as individuals in our churches are filled with God, the result of that is that

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:06.719
we'll be reaching people with the gospel.

00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:11.119
The result of that is that the church house will be filled up.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:13.399
But that's not the number one goal.

00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:17.599
The number one goal is that I'm filled with God.

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:18.839
Be filled with the spirit.

00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:23.479
We spoke of that last Sunday evening and the importance of that truth.

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:28.279
There's a great contrast in Hosea 10 as we wrap up this morning.

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:33.399
In Hosea 10 verses 12 and 13, there's a great contrast between those two verses of scripture.

00:42:33.399 --> 00:42:39.879
And we find that the contrast is provided to us and we find that really in verse number

00:42:39.879 --> 00:42:44.439
12, the prophet of God is telling them that they need a different path than the one in

00:42:44.439 --> 00:42:46.799
which they've journeyed on.

00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:52.719
The path in which they've been on is given to us in verse number 13 and he says, no,

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:53.719
you need a different path.

00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:59.099
And as we would begin to consider and really conclude this message this morning on this

00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:05.559
preparation for revival miniseries, this pathway to revival, we must look at the contrast here.

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:10.879
He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground

00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:15.559
for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.879
Notice what they have been doing.

00:43:17.879 --> 00:43:23.999
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lies

00:43:23.999 --> 00:43:27.079
because thou didst trust.

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:34.559
Notice these words, in thy way, thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty

00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:38.559
men.

00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:42.199
Solomon said, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in Proverbs 3, that we're

00:43:42.199 --> 00:43:47.919
to lean not on understanding, right, we're to trust in the Lord with all of our hearts.

00:43:47.919 --> 00:43:52.079
And here the word of God tells us that they were trusting in their own way.

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:55.679
They had plowed wickedness, they had reaped iniquity, they've eaten the fruit of their

00:43:55.679 --> 00:44:01.199
lies, they had had a trust, a confidence in the multitude of their mighty men.

00:44:01.199 --> 00:44:08.079
And we find that here the prophet of God, Hosea, is saying, look, you need to change

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:11.479
your course, you need to get on a different path.

00:44:11.479 --> 00:44:17.759
If you desire that God would come and rain righteousness upon you, then you need to change

00:44:17.759 --> 00:44:21.559
your course, you need to change your path.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:27.799
As we consider this morning the pathway to revival, we recognize, acknowledge the need

00:44:27.799 --> 00:44:28.799
for revival.

00:44:29.399 --> 00:44:37.160
If you weren't here last Sunday, you listened to the message, I believe that it was quite

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.519
obvious that there's a need for revival.

00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:44.440
And again, it's not just that we point at another denomination, another group of people

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.319
and say, look at them, look at all their, no, no, the light of God's word shines on

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:49.319
us.

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:53.919
Say, God, I need revival, God, we need revival.

00:44:53.919 --> 00:44:58.880
When we acknowledge that need, what's the pathway to revival?

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.199
Three thoughts this morning, it's time to plow.

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.399
It's time for God to work.

00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:07.479
I agree with the psalmist in Psalm 119, 126, but the prophet says, well, there's some things

00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:08.479
that you need to do.

00:45:08.479 --> 00:45:12.399
Number one, you need to plow, break up your fallow ground, plant, sow to yourselves in

00:45:12.399 --> 00:45:13.399
righteousness.

00:45:13.399 --> 00:45:21.239
And then we need to pursue, seeking God, not just for a blessing, but seeking God because

00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:27.639
he's worthy of our pursuit, because he's a good God, he's a great God.

00:45:27.639 --> 00:45:29.119
We're pursuing him.

00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:35.699
Next week, we'll have our third message on this thought of the preparation for revival

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:39.119
and ask ourselves this question, am I revival ready?

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.239
It'll be wonderful.

00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:44.559
Come to church next week already having revival.

00:45:44.559 --> 00:45:46.319
I preach a message, are you revival ready?

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:51.039
Man, we're not revival ready, we're having revival, amen?

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:56.639
Because revival is when God brings his people back to spiritual health.

00:45:56.639 --> 00:46:04.599
This morning, I don't want to just be cleaner, I want to be clean.

00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:11.720
Preparation for revival, the pathway to revival, there are hindrances, there are hindrances,

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.000
many hindrances.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.039
But I hope that we'd clear the hindrances out and say, I'm going to get on that path.

00:46:19.039 --> 00:46:20.039
Let's pray together.

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:21.199
God, we love you.

00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:22.599
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:22.599 --> 00:46:26.799
We thank you, God, for the opportunity that you've given us to gather together.

00:46:26.799 --> 00:46:29.599
We thank you for your word, for the truth of your word.

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:40.119
God, we pray that you would, in these few moments, these quiet moments, Lord, of invitation,

00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:44.919
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would move in hearts and lives.

00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:48.799
You'd take your word and minister as only you can.

00:46:48.799 --> 00:46:58.880
I pray that we take the time to respond, that we would not leave here just by checking

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:08.119
a box and filling a requirement, quote unquote, but God, that we truly let you have your way.

00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:15.079
We'd get on this pathway to revival, help us to have hearts that are tender, ready to

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:19.119
receive the seed of your word.

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:21.199
Help us, Lord.

00:47:21.199 --> 00:47:25.160
We need you.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.799
Pray that you'd work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:47:27.799 --> 00:47:28.799
Would you stand with me?

00:47:28.799 --> 00:47:32.199
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:32.199 --> 00:47:36.479
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she plays, the altar is open.

00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:42.279
Come and ask the Lord to just respond to God, however he's spoken to you this morning.

00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:44.039
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
