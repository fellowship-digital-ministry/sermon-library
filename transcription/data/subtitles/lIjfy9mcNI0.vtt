00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Number 11, 1 Corinthians chapter number 11.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.360
As you see this evening, we will observe the Lord's Supper.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.680
And this is one of two ordinances for the local church.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.159
I'm thankful that God in his omniscience

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.399
that he gave to the local church,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:22.079
the ordinance of baptism, believers baptism by immersion,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.040
and then also the ordinance of the Lord's Supper.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.639
It's important that we understand the biblical foundation

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:31.879
that God has given us for these two ordinances.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.580
We understand that baptism cannot save you

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.119
the same fashion, these elements that we will partake of

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.659
at the end of the service, there's no ability

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.799
within these elements to save you

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:48.799
to as you partake of to bear upon you some level of grace.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.880
It just doesn't work that way.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.240
Salvation is through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.680
and his substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.080
his death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.400
We understand that God has given to us as a local church,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.279
this ordinance as a memorial.

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.260
And so that we would remember,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.959
so that we would have that opportunity

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:17.000
each time that you walk into our sanctuary

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.319
on the front of this table,

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.800
it says this do in remembrance of me.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.440
And we find that in 1 Corinthians 11,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.080
and we observe this evening,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.519
this wonderful ordinance that's been given

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.760
to the local church in this church age.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.720
Notice with me beginning in verse 23 this evening,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.199
we'll read the text of scripture.

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:35.440
When we observe the Lord's Supper,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.739
I don't always preach from this passage of scripture.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.080
However, I seek the face of God with regard to messages,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.019
obviously each and every week.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:46.440
And God probably at least once a year

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.919
just leads me to preach from the passage

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.040
when we're going to deal with the Lord's Supper

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.959
because there is confusion

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.879
amongst some with regard to this ordinance.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.519
And we want to ensure that there's great clarity

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.720
as we study the word of God this evening.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.480
Notice in verse number 23, the Bible says this,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479
for I have received of the Lord

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.639
that which also I delivered unto you,

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.839
that the Lord Jesus, the same night

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.039
in which he was betrayed, took bread.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.479
And when he had given thanks,

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.279
he break it and said, take eat.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.080
This is my body, which is broken for you,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.460
this do in remembrance of me.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.600
After the same manner also he took the cup

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.559
when he had supped saying,

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.479
this cup is the New Testament in my blood.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:38.479
This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.320
For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.479
you do show the Lord's death till he come.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.500
Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.119
and drink this cup of the Lord,

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.600
unworthily shall be guilty of the body

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240
and blood of the Lord.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.440
But let a man examine himself.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.960
And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.520
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080
not discerning the Lord's body.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.899
For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.639
and many sleep.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.440
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520
This evening as we look at this familiar passage

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.000
of scripture and deal with the subject matter

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.320
of the Lord's Supper,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.720
let me give you three thoughts tonight

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960
with regard to the Lord's Supper

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.059
that I hope would encourage and strengthen each of us.

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.539
If you're taking notes this evening,

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.580
number one, it's a time of reflection.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.000
We observe the Lord's Supper,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.479
first of all, it's a time of reflection.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.679
We find that as we reflect upon this ordinance

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.619
that's been given to us as a local church

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.539
and we reflect upon what took place,

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.779
what is signified, what is it that we're to remember

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.059
as we observe the Lord's Supper.

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.899
Again, it's not simply a religious exercise.

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.220
There's no ability for these elements to save anyone,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.339
but we find that it's a time of reflection.

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.339
It's a reminder for those that have been saved

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:09.419
by the grace of God to understand and be reminded

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.020
what Christ did for us.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.380
And we begin to think about this time of reflection

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.059
as a local church, as we come together

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.500
for the purpose of observing the Lord's Supper.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.540
And we take that time, it's a time that's a sober time.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.059
It's a time in which it requires examination

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.920
as we see in the text of scripture,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.700
but we're reflecting upon what took place at Calvary

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.220
so many years ago.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.380
We think nearly 2000 years ago.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.140
Now this event that took place at Calvary,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.260
and we find in verse 24, this time of reflection,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.420
we find that his body is represented

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.540
as it's spoken of here in verse 24.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.260
And we notice and we're reminded how it was beaten for us.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.420
Notice broken for you.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.260
In verse 24, the Bible says,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.179
and when he had given thanks, he break it and said,

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:03.820
take eat, this is my body, which is broken for you.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.820
Notice this do in remembrance of me.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.100
We've often said, as we observe the Lord's Supper

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.059
that it is a picture, it is a memorial.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.140
We believe this evening, the teaching of scripture

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.179
where the Bible says that this is a,

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:20.660
this do in remembrance of me.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.459
We do not believe in transubstantiation

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:25.500
or consubstantiation, no.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.660
These elements, when we pray over them,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.700
they remain exactly what they are.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.179
They do not change into anything.

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:36.739
They simply represent the body of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:38.660
that was broken for us.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.579
Begin to think about, and we're not gonna turn there

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:41.859
this evening for sake of time,

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:43.500
but if you go back to the gospel records

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.019
and you can look at any of them,

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.739
and as you look at the gospel records and you read

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:49.940
of the time in which the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.779
was led up to Calvary, you can think of even

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.739
the evening before as he's dealing with such persecution

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:58.380
and all that he's dealing with

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.059
and how he was beaten and broken and all that he endured.

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.220
Why did he do that?

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.940
So that we might be saved.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.459
We understand that the scripture say, and Paul says this,

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:13.420
that if we could be saved, he says,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.500
I do not frustrate the grace of God,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.100
for if righteousness came by the law,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.420
then Christ is dead in vain in Galatians.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.260
We find that Jesus Christ did not die in vain.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.700
No, his body was broken for us,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.820
and we can take our time this evening

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.459
and reflect upon what it cost for us to be saved.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.299
We sing about being saved.

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.140
We rejoice in the truth that heaven is our home,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.140
and what a wonderful blessing that is.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.260
But it cost Jesus everything.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.779
The Bible continues this time of reflection,

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.660
not only with the body of Christ and the bread

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.820
representing the body of Christ which was broken for us,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.660
but in verse 25, he says, after the same manner also

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.700
he took the cup when he had supped, saying,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.179
this cup is the New Testament in my blood.

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.619
This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:08.619
We, as I mentioned after the first song this evening

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:09.619
in Sunday school this morning,

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:11.859
we dealt with the blood of Christ

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:14.380
and the importance of Christ's blood.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.339
And I'm so thankful that God showed us in his word

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.940
from the beginning in Genesis three,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.279
and we looked at so many examples this morning

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:24.540
of the blood of Christ.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.239
And we understand that we're not redeemed

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:27.500
with corruptible things,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.940
but we're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.700
And hallelujah for that truth.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.500
And we find this evening that as we have

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.339
this time of reflection,

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:41.279
that it brings our minds back to Calvary.

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:44.899
It causes us as the people of God,

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.059
those that have been saved by the grace of God,

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.420
if you're here tonight, you know that heaven is your home,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.519
you've been saved by the blood of Christ,

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:52.779
you have been redeemed,

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.059
understanding that there's no works that you can do

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:56.299
to get to heaven on your own,

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:59.100
there's no merit in anything that you could do,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.179
Jesus Christ paid it all,

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.420
and you've trusted Christ as your savior.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.839
Well, when we observe this Lord's Supper,

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:10.140
it causes you to reflect on what Christ did for you,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.380
and how much he loved you,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.899
and how he was willing to go to that cross.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.100
He said in John 10 that he's the good shepherd.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.500
And he said as the good shepherd

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500
that he was going to lay down his life for the sheep.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.500
Why?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.179
Because the only way for mankind to be redeemed,

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:29.899
to be reconciled was if God in flesh,

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:31.619
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:34.940
took our place on the cross of Calvary.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.479
And hallelujah that he did.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.979
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.099
maybe you're here this evening,

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:40.020
you've never been saved,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.179
maybe somebody's tuned in via live stream this evening,

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.419
and they've never been saved,

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.099
and they do not have that assurance

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:47.260
that heaven is your home.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.340
Could I tell you this evening

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.739
that these elements that we will partake of,

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.059
really they're not for you if you're not saved,

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:54.619
they're for saved people.

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:56.219
But if somebody is not saved,

00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:57.880
these elements, they can't save you,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.239
there's no saving grace in them.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:02.400
What you need tonight is salvation.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.559
You need to be born again,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:05.640
to understand that you're a sinner

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.640
and that Jesus is the only savior.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.840
And he said that he loved you and he died for you.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.359
He said that this, he said,

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:14.039
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:17.760
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.260
Peter declared in Acts 4,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.239
neither is there salvation in any other.

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:26.479
There's no other name under heaven given among men

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:30.599
whereby we must be saved.

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:33.080
We find that God, the God of the universe,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.280
he offers a gift.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.799
We refer to it as God refers to it

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:38.039
as the gift of God,

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:41.559
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.679
And I'm so thankful that he offers that gift.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.340
I've had opportunities over the years,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.559
as many of you have,

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:49.059
to be able to speak to someone about the gift of God,

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:52.020
to be able to talk to them about how much God loved them

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.280
and share with them the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.760
We just sang this evening about,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.200
Lord, give me a passion for souls.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.039
Why?

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:04.679
we sing that song? Well, because we understand the grace of God, we understand the love of

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:10.119
God, we understand the gospel. And Paul said, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:15.399
Why? For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:20.639
and also to the Greek. So this evening as we observe the Lord's Supper, we find first

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:28.039
of all that the Lord's Supper is a time of reflection. Time of reflection. I hope tonight

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:36.959
that you never get over what Christ did so that you could be saved. I hope that you never

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:44.479
get over it, lose the awe of it. How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:50.439
we read in the book of Hebrews? I hope that we never get over what Christ did for us.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:56.159
It's a time that we can reflect on. By the way, baptism, the second ordinance, if we

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:59.879
look at those two ordinances that were given to the local church, that too represents the

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:04.999
fact that Jesus Christ died for us, he was buried and he rose again. So what does it

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:08.919
remind us of? Well, it reminds us of what Christ did for us so we could be saved. So

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:13.439
it's a time of reflection. Number two this evening, I believe that the Lord's Supper

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:18.679
is not only a time of reflection, but I believe that it's a time of rejoicing. If you're saved

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:23.279
tonight, observing the Lord's Supper is a time of rejoicing. And we begin to rejoice.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:28.359
Why? Because we understand the sacrifice that was made on the cross of Calvary. We understand

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:33.039
as we look at this passage of Scripture here this evening that not only is it this due

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:38.839
in remembrance of me, this reflection back at what Jesus did, but it's a time of rejoicing.

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:45.639
Why? Because God loved me and he died for me so that I could be saved. He loved me so

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:52.639
much I was that valuable, you were that valuable to God, that he died for you. It's a time

00:11:53.359 --> 00:12:00.119
of rejoicing that we rejoice in the sacrifice that Christ made at Calvary. Not only a time

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:05.039
of rejoicing because of the sacrifice, the substitutionary atonement, but we find that

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:10.339
it's a time of rejoicing. Why? Because of his glorious resurrection. You know, we take

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:15.179
and look at the Lord's Supper here and we understand that the Bible says in verse 26,

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:21.779
for as often as you drink this bread and, excuse me, eat this bread and drink this cup.

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:25.579
Notice the Bible doesn't tell us how often to do it, but it simply says for as often

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:30.579
as you eat this bread and drink this cup. Notice the Bible says ye do show the Lord's

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:37.579
death till he come. So it doesn't capture in that verse of Scripture the resurrection,

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:43.099
but it's obvious as you read the Scripture that it says that we're reminded of his death

00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:50.099
and we do show his death till he come. Well, he's coming back because he rose again. Amen?

00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:56.539
And so we celebrate the glorious resurrection, we think, as we have in just a few weeks,

00:12:56.539 --> 00:13:01.619
the opportunity to have Resurrection Sunday. But we understand that every Sunday is Resurrection

00:13:01.619 --> 00:13:06.139
Sunday. Why is it that we meet on Sunday? Well, because we serve a risen Savior. Up

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:11.579
from the grave he arose. We sing that song and we rejoice in understanding that he lives,

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:18.179
he lives, Christ Jesus lives today. But we find that the resurrection is the cornerstone

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:24.259
of our faith. The book of 1 Corinthians, it says if Christ be not risen, then our faith

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:30.059
is in vain, our preaching is in vain. But what separates biblical Christianity from

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:34.539
any other religion, and it's not a religion, but if I could use that term this evening

00:13:34.539 --> 00:13:41.539
of any other religion of the world, is that we serve a risen Savior. You can go to Israel

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:49.219
and you can go and you can walk and you can see and you're not going to find any bones

00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:56.219
of Jesus because he rose. You can argue about which place is the right place, but the reality

00:13:57.499 --> 00:14:03.779
is that it was just a borrowed place. Amen? And he rose conquering sin, death, and the

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:09.619
grave. They came early that morning to the tomb and guess what they found? They found

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:15.459
that the stone was rolled away. So when we celebrate, when we observe the Lord's Supper,

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:20.339
it's a time of reflection, yes, but it's a time of rejoicing. Why? Because Jesus died

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:26.579
for me. Because Jesus rose conquering sin, death, and the grave. We can rejoice because

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:33.579
of his exalted position. You know, at this very moment, Jesus Christ is exalted in heaven

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:39.379
and we can read of the account in the book of Acts in the first chapter and after the

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:45.699
resurrection of Jesus Christ, he lived on this earth and gave instruction to his disciples,

00:14:45.699 --> 00:14:49.939
but then came the day that he would ascend to heaven. And the Bible records it at the

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:53.859
end of the Gospel of Luke and then in Acts chapter number 1, and the Bible says that

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:58.339
Jesus gave instruction and then as they were standing there and receiving that instruction,

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:02.419
the Bible tells us that Jesus was ascended up into heaven. What a sight it would have

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:08.859
been. These men, they continue to stand there looking up into heaven and then the angels

00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:15.259
come and say, you men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? We'll deal with

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:20.779
the rest of that statement in just a moment, but understand that he's in an exalted position.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:24.619
The Bible says that he ever liveth to make intercession for us. If you're a child of

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:28.379
God this evening, if you're saved by the grace of God, then you understand that as

00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:34.539
Jesus is in this exalted position, that he ever lives to make intercession for us. And

00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:39.019
what a blessing that is. He's at the right hand of the Father. He's in the throne room

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:46.499
of heaven and he lives. He's alive. He's making intercession for us. Hallelujah. And it should

00:15:46.499 --> 00:15:51.619
cause us to rejoice as we observe the Lord's Supper. Yes, it's a time of reflection, but

00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:59.299
it's a time of rejoicing. We have hope and we have this peace because we serve a risen

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:05.299
Savior because he is exalted. The Bible tells us that God has given a name which is above

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:10.779
every name. In the name of Jesus, every tongue should confess and every knee is going to

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:17.459
bow that Jesus Christ is Lord. The glory of the Father. What a blessing to understand

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:22.819
the exalted position of our Savior. Notice the last three words of verse 26. The Bible

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:32.179
says, till he come. A time of rejoicing because of his promised return. A time of rejoicing

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:36.699
because of his promised return. As we observe the Lord's Supper, we're reminded of what

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:43.379
Christ did for us. We're reminded of what he's currently doing for us, but we're reminded

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:48.499
that one day he's coming back for us. Because the Bible says that as often as you eat this

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:55.619
bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. I'm looking forward

00:16:55.619 --> 00:17:01.539
to the trumpet of the Lord sounding. I'm looking forward to being with my Savior for all of

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:06.779
eternity. And the Bible says that Jesus is coming back. He says to the disciples, let

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:11.099
not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.419
are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:22.139
you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again. That where I am, there

00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:27.059
ye may be also. The Bible says in a moment, the twinkling of an eye. The Bible says the

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:34.019
last trump. We find that that's the truth in 1 Corinthians 15. In 1 Thessalonians chapter

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:41.259
4, the Bible says this, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:46.659
the voice of an archangel, with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:50.499
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:17:50.499 --> 00:17:55.179
to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort

00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:02.219
one another with these words. There in Acts chapter 1, when the disciples saw Jesus ascending

00:18:02.219 --> 00:18:05.819
up into heaven and those angels came and said, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:11.259
up into heaven? They finish and say this, this same Jesus which you've seen go up into

00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:18.379
heaven shall come again. He shall come in like matter, is what the Bible says. And this

00:18:18.379 --> 00:18:23.619
evening when we begin to think about this promise that we read in 1 Corinthians chapter

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:29.659
11 and verse number 26 as we look at this truth that the Lord's Supper, it shows his

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:39.820
death, till he come. I often think about the return of the Lord. It's an exciting truth

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:47.159
of God's Word. It's a reality. It's going to happen. We live every day with the understanding

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:53.219
of the imminent return of Christ. I wonder this evening, are you ready for his return?

00:18:53.219 --> 00:19:00.539
Are you ready for his return? The Bible says in 1 John, the truth with regard to the coming

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:07.659
of Christ and the fact that we have this hope. He says, every man that hath this hope purifies

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:17.179
himself even as he is pure. The Bible says that we could be ashamed at his appearing.

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:23.500
I hope this evening that no one here would be ashamed at the appearing of Christ. That

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:30.820
we'd live every moment as if it could be the last moment that Jesus is coming back. What

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.519
a blessed reality of Scripture. We look at this Lord's Supper this evening and we see

00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:43.739
that it's a time of reflection, no doubt. We find it's a time of rejoicing or this evening.

00:19:44.459 --> 00:19:49.820
How are we doing with rejoicing? Wednesday evening this past week I had as our study

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.579
1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 16 as we're studying through the instructions given to the church

00:19:55.579 --> 00:20:00.099
at Thessalonica at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5 and eventually we'll get to the end of

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:05.739
2 Thessalonians 3. And as we look at those two passages of Scripture we find that God

00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:10.979
gives us some very practical instruction for every local church. This past Wednesday evening

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:18.819
the simple verse of Scripture that we dealt with was rejoice evermore. Literally to rejoice

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:24.699
at all times. And we find this evening that as we observe the Lord's Supper it should

00:20:24.699 --> 00:20:31.179
be a time of rejoicing. Time of rejoicing. I wonder as you go throughout your day, as

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:35.739
you go throughout this week, how often are we rejoicing because of what Jesus did for

00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:40.459
us? Because of the ultimate price that was paid at Calvary? How often are we rejoicing

00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:46.559
because He rose conquering sin, death and the grave? How often do we live in that resurrection

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:54.079
power understanding that we serve a risen Savior? How often do we rejoice knowing that

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:59.959
He's at the right hand of the Father making intercession for us? How often do we rejoice

00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:06.719
knowing that He's coming again? I hope that you're longing for His return. But understand

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:12.279
with me this evening that the time is short. He says that we're to redeem the time because

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:18.999
the days are evil. When Jesus comes back, and I'm looking forward to Him coming back,

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:25.359
but you know there's no more opportunity to share the gospel with someone. There's no

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:32.519
more opportunity to be surrendered, to be yielded. There's no more opportunity to send

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:39.039
a missionary to give a contribution to… all those opportunities are gone. Why? Because

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:45.679
you will ever be with the Lord. So this evening as we think about this time of rejoicing,

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:51.279
I hope that we would rejoice greatly as we observe the Lord's Supper this evening. I

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:56.839
would say that not only is it a time of reflection and a time of rejoicing, but I would say this,

00:21:56.839 --> 00:22:01.999
number three, if you're taking notes, it's a time to refocus. Time to refocus. You know

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:07.039
if we're not careful in life we can lose our focus. You ever have that happen? You

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:12.719
ever get distracted by something? You ever see a squirrel? Seems like those squirrels,

00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:16.039
I mean they get distracted by everything, but sometimes we can be the same way. We can

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:21.519
just get distracted by things. Some people are easily distracted, some people are oblivious.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:26.259
You've met both kinds, no doubt. But understand with me this evening that there are times

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:30.439
in our lives as Christians, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we can lose our

00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:36.479
focus. We can get distracted. We can get distracted by the things of this world. We can get distracted

00:22:36.639 --> 00:22:43.639
by good things that might not be the best things. We can get distracted by being involved

00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:50.519
in something that we think is a good thing, is an honorable task, but it's not the best

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:57.519
thing. It's not what God wants us to be doing. On any given day that God would give to any

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:03.959
of us, we have the same amount of time. You ever hear somebody say, I need to make some

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:10.639
time? You can't make time. All you can do is manage it. You can steward time. And how

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:17.639
we steward time is so important because time, once it's gone, is gone. And this evening,

00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:26.199
when we think about this time to refocus, the reality is that as God's people living

00:23:26.199 --> 00:23:32.939
in the world, though we're not of the world, we can become distracted. I think about Peter

00:23:32.939 --> 00:23:39.299
in John chapter 21. He's talking with the Lord Jesus Christ, and the understanding in

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:44.939
John 21, it starts with Peter saying, I go fishing, and he's out there, and then Jesus

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:49.179
is on the shore, and he calls out to those that are there in the boat, and he says, have

00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:56.179
you any, did you catch anything? Now that's a bad question if you've not caught anything.

00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:03.819
Right? It's embarrassing as a fisherman if you're out fishing and you've caught nothing.

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:11.179
By the way, this isn't the first time in Peter's ministry, or Peter's life, I should say, that

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:15.619
he was asked this question, or should I say that he had a night where he caught nothing.

00:24:15.619 --> 00:24:20.419
You remember when he was first called to the ministry, he said they've toiled all the night

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:27.419
and they've caught nothing, but Jesus says, go out, launch out into the deep. Let down

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:32.699
your nets for a draft of fishes. And Peter says we've toiled all the night and we've

00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:39.459
caught nothing, nevertheless at thy word, we'll let down the net, singular. They caught

00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:45.139
so many fish, they had to have people come and help them. And now you fast forward to

00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:51.179
after the crucifixion and the resurrection, and Peter says I'm going fishing, and the

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:56.419
others go with them, and he says, Jesus says in verse number 5 of John 21, children, have

00:24:56.419 --> 00:25:03.419
ye any meat? And they answered him, no, no. So Jesus said, cast the net on the right side

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:10.579
of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:17.499
it for the multitude of fishes. And then John, who refers to himself as the disciple

00:25:17.499 --> 00:25:24.499
whom Jesus loved, he simply says this, it is the Lord. It is the Lord! And Peter gets

00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:32.619
excited, he jumps off the boat, man, he's getting back to shore, amen? And he gets to

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:38.439
shore and guess what, there's already fish on the fire. And Jesus has this conversation

00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:43.119
with Peter and he says, Peter, do you love me? He goes through that process three times

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:49.879
and we find that in verse 19, the Bible says, this spake he signifying by what death he

00:25:49.879 --> 00:25:56.399
should glorify God. When he had spoken this, he saith unto him, follow me. The instruction

00:25:56.399 --> 00:26:03.399
was simple, it was direct, it was clear. Follow me. And Peter, the Bible says in verse 20,

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:09.719
turning about, he seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following. So what does he do?

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:16.719
Well, he turns around and he sees John. He gets distracted. He sees John. He's heard

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:23.919
the instruction from Jesus, follow me. And he sees John and he says, look, it says this,

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:29.519
which also leaned on his breast at supper and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth

00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:33.719
thee? So he's talking about John. You can go back to John 13 and verse 25 and see that.

00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:40.719
Verse 21, Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? You know,

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:48.679
for a moment there, Peter got distracted because he was wondering what's John going to do?

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:53.879
You know, if we're not careful, we can get distracted by what somebody else is doing

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:59.839
or what somebody else is supposed to be doing. But Jesus was clear in speaking to Peter and

00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:06.839
said, follow me. And so after Peter asked the question, Lord, what shall this man do?

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:15.199
Jesus saith unto him, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow

00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:22.199
thou me. I love the response of Jesus. If I could say it this way, he says, it's none

00:27:23.199 --> 00:27:30.199
of your business what my plan is for John. Your job is to follow me. He says, if I will

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:39.759
that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? He restates what he had previously revealed

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:49.879
to Peter, follow thou me. There's a lot of things that can distract us in life.

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:57.879
In 1 Corinthians 11, we read this passage with regard to the Lord's Supper. We find

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:03.119
that there's reason to rejoice, but really, I believe as a local church, God in His omniscience

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:09.919
in giving us this ordinance, it brings us to a place, a sober place of reflecting upon

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:16.399
what Christ did for us. It caused us to rejoice in that sacrifice, but also to rejoice in

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:23.399
the resurrection and His soon return. But then we refocus. Why? Because we examine

00:28:23.879 --> 00:28:30.039
ourselves. The Bible says in verse 27, wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this

00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:34.679
cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:39.000
a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.139
that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning

00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:47.359
the Lord's body. For this cause, those that were eating and drinking unworthily, many

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:53.659
are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep or have died. For if we would judge ourselves,

00:28:53.659 --> 00:29:00.659
we should not be judged. No doubt as we look at this aspect of this examination, it's so

00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:05.940
that we would be worthy of taking, partaking of the Lord's Supper. Now understand in our

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.619
own person, in our own ability, we're never going to be worthy, but if you've been saved

00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:15.019
by the grace of God, and you're clean as we preached about this morning, there's no

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:19.299
sin between me and my Savior, I've confessed whatever it is that God's pointed out in my

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:26.299
life, then I can partake of these elements. The idea of these elements in this passage

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:31.199
with regard to examining ourselves is not to say, well I have sin in my life, so I'm

00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:35.919
just going to pass by, I'm going to let it pass. No, it's that I would deal with it.

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:39.500
If you're not saved this evening, the idea is not that you'd say, well I'm not saved

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.500
so that's not for me. No, it's that you would be saved as we observe this Lord's Supper.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:52.500
But I want you to think tonight, yes this aspect of examination, but this time for us

00:29:53.539 --> 00:30:00.539
to refocus. I want you to consider tonight your position as a child of God.

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:01.539
God.

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:10.019
If you're saved tonight, if you've been born again, God is your Father, you're His child.

00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:11.539
You may be a lot of things.

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:13.579
What do I mean by that?

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:21.139
You may have titles and you may have degrees, but the greatest, most important thing is

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:26.179
your position in Christ.

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:32.739
If we're not careful, we get so caught up in these things and we can lose our focus,

00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:35.619
we can become distracted.

00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:41.699
You've heard people ask, no doubt, why am I here, what's my purpose?

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:45.619
I hope as a child of God that you don't struggle with that question.

00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:50.959
I hope as a child of God that you understand that you're here to be His representative,

00:30:50.959 --> 00:30:55.459
that your purpose is to bring honor and glory to Christ.

00:30:55.459 --> 00:31:00.919
Whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.

00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:04.079
Is that not what your Bible says?

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:06.919
He didn't say do some, do most, He said do all.

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:12.959
John said, I must decrease, He, Christ, must increase, John the Baptist said.

00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:18.739
Tonight, we understand why we're here.

00:31:18.739 --> 00:31:24.979
I know there are times we say, man, I wish I was in heaven, looking forward to heaven.

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:29.319
But if we're still here, if God's still giving us breath, He's left us here for a purpose,

00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:31.519
He has a plan for our lives.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:34.399
And our greatest position is our position in Christ.

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:40.519
Again, you may be a lot of things, you may have titles, you may have degrees, but you

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:46.639
know, what shall it profit a man if he gained the whole world and loses his own soul?

00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:57.459
The greatest title that you could have, that I could have, is I'm a child of the King.

00:31:57.459 --> 00:32:00.539
God is my Father.

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:03.299
What a blessing.

00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:08.539
And if we understand that tonight, it's this time to refocus why.

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:09.539
What am I doing?

00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:10.539
You ever wonder?

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:15.139
You ever look at your life, kind of just take back and say, what am I doing?

00:32:15.139 --> 00:32:16.999
What am I doing?

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:23.679
Is there anything that I'm doing that's eternal, or is everything that I'm doing temporal?

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:26.799
Is there any way that I'm investing in eternity?

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:29.759
Is there anything that I'm doing that's of eternal value?

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:32.199
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:32:32.199 --> 00:32:38.399
And I believe tonight it's this time when we observe the Lord's Supper to refocus because

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:41.399
God's left us here for a purpose.

00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:44.459
God has a plan for each of our lives.

00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:50.799
And how appropriate that we sang a song tonight, give me a passion for souls, dear Lord.

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:55.019
Because truly, that should be our passion.

00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:58.979
Have you ever seen someone driving down the road with a bumper sticker, I'd rather be,

00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:02.739
and it says, I'd rather be golfing, I'd rather be sailing, I'd rather be, you fill in the

00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:04.979
blank, I've seen them, you've seen them.

00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:07.379
I've never seen one that said, I'd rather be winning souls.

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:13.439
But you know, as a child of God, if you've ever led somebody to Christ, there is nothing

00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:15.599
like it.

00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:20.899
There is absolutely nothing like taking a Bible and showing somebody how they could

00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:24.219
know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:33:24.219 --> 00:33:30.159
And seeing that spiritual birth, that person under the conviction of the Holy Spirit of

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:35.159
God understands that they're a sinner, and that there's no way they could save themselves.

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:39.099
They are guilty before God.

00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:42.459
They will spend eternity in the lake of fire because that is the wage of sin.

00:33:42.459 --> 00:33:44.599
The wage of sin is death.

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:53.019
But they recognize that God loved them, that God will save them, that God took their place

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:55.659
and offers them that gift of salvation.

00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:59.659
The Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:33:59.659 --> 00:34:02.859
They bow their head, their heart before God.

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:05.739
They cry out, Lord, save me.

00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:08.959
And there's nothing like it in all the world.

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.039
It's absolutely wonderful.

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:14.719
And tonight, as we think about observing the Lord's Supper, we're going to have a time

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:20.439
of silence and prayer here in just a moment before we distribute the elements.

00:34:20.439 --> 00:34:24.599
We'll read some of the verses again before we distribute and partake.

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.999
It's a time of reflection.

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:30.999
I hope that not only at the Lord's Supper, but regularly in your life, you think back

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:38.179
as to what it costs for you to be saved, what Christ did for you.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:44.659
I hope that you rejoice, not only in what he did for you, but what he is doing for you

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.739
and how he's coming back for you.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.059
And that's reason to rejoice.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:53.699
But I hope we take a few moments tonight to refocus.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:59.259
Because if we'd be honest tonight, at times in our lives, we can all get a little distracted.

00:34:59.259 --> 00:35:04.239
We all need a little recalibration, if you will, some refocus.

00:35:04.239 --> 00:35:07.639
And we say, God, why am I here?

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.239
What's your plan for me?

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:12.479
What is it I'm supposed to be doing?

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:15.599
And we know the answers to those questions as we study God's Word.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:20.559
We're to live for him, we're to please him, we're to bring glory to his name.

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:24.039
And God reveals in his Word the things that do just that.

00:35:24.299 --> 00:35:32.379
And tonight, maybe some of us need to refocus a little bit and understand the greatest title,

00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:37.579
my greatest position, is that I am a child of the King.

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:38.579
Praise the Lord.

00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:39.579
Hallelujah.

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:40.579
Let's pray together.

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:43.059
Father, we love you.

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:45.379
How we thank you for loving us.

00:35:45.379 --> 00:35:49.779
We thank you, God, for the privilege of being able to gather together this evening.

00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:53.419
We thank you for the Word of God and the truth that's contained therein.

00:35:53.799 --> 00:35:58.999
We thank you for the Lord's Supper, this ordinance that you've given to us as a local church.

00:35:58.999 --> 00:36:02.799
And God, we thank you for the opportunity that we'll have in just a moment to partake

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:04.039
of these elements.

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:09.959
And God, I pray that even as we've had opportunity this evening to preach from this passage of

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:16.399
Scripture that you would help us to understand with great clarity that there's nothing within

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:21.599
these elements that can save an individual, that salvation is through the blood of Jesus

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:23.099
Christ.

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:27.759
His substitutionary death, His glorious resurrection.

00:36:27.759 --> 00:36:29.679
We serve a risen Savior.

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:36.319
Lord, if there's one that's present, whether they're here in person or tuned in via livestream,

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:41.599
they're not sure of heaven, and I pray that tonight they would trust Christ as their Savior.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:47.079
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would draw them, convict them of their sin and of Christ's

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:49.679
righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:53.039
Lord, I pray for every child of God tonight.

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:59.059
Lord, would you help us to rejoice as we observe this table tonight, the Lord's Supper.

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:00.059
Help us to rejoice.

00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:04.579
God, I pray that you'd help us to refocus.

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:13.219
God, I believe that in each of our lives there are times that we just get distracted, get

00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:14.819
off course just a little bit.

00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:18.619
God, I pray that you'd help us tonight to refocus.

00:37:18.619 --> 00:37:24.039
I pray that in these moments of invitation, these moments of examination, that God, you'd

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:25.839
have your will in way.

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:29.919
I pray, Lord, that if there's sin in our lives, that we'd confess it and forsake it, that

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:32.639
we'd have forgiveness.

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:35.679
God, we'll thank you for all that you'll do.

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:38.239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
