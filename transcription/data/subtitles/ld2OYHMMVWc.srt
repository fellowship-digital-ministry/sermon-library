1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,119
their care for us, most hospitable, and we're so grateful.

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:06,599
I thank you this morning, but I will thank you again

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,680
as you're opening to Romans chapter eight.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,119
Thank you for the lovely home we have while we're here.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,120
I jokingly said to Pastor Mann that our two days

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,100
might just be extended to six months.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,879
We're so comfortable there, but thank you very much.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,020
You are certainly a great blessing to us.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,860
Thank you for your very faithful support

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,099
and for very substantial gifts, offerings,

11
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:38,060
given to the ministry, not only for the Bible efforts,

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,139
but for the church planting efforts.

13
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,540
You have come through truly in Herculean fashion

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,259
this last year, and we are very, very grateful for that.

15
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,380
So please continue to keep those things in prayer.

16
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:57,700
Our message tonight is called to convey,

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,939
called to convey.

18
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,740
We're gonna start with one reading.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,139
There are actually three readings,

20
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:08,260
and they are the only three times you find the phrase

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,220
love of Christ in the Bible.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,819
Love of God is a more common expression,

23
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,300
but this specific phrase, love of Christ.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,860
And so let's begin with Romans chapter eight,

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,860
those wonderful, climactic, mountaintop verses

26
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,260
at the end of that chapter.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,180
Romans chapter eight, verses 35 to 39.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,040
And I don't even recall from this morning

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,919
if it's the practice of the church or not,

30
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,139
but if you're able, would you stand with me

31
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:40,540
for the reading of God's word,

32
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,260
then we'll make a prayer and be seated.

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,779
Romans chapter eight, verses 35 to 39.

34
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,660
Let's just read those all together.

35
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,919
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

36
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:58,720
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,720
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,919
As it is written, for thy sake we are killed

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,679
all the day long.

40
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,839
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

41
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:16,940
Nay, in all those things we are more than conquerors

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,279
through him that loved us.

43
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,160
For I am persuaded that neither death,

44
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,360
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,080
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,360
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
shall be able to separate us from the love of God

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,520
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,759
Father, I thank you for the reading of your word.

50
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,880
I thank you that we live in a country

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,119
that is still free, that we can gather

52
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:53,639
and worship you, and praise you, read your scriptures,

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,440
and speak freely of your son, our savior,

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,039
the Lord Jesus Christ, and the salvation

55
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,399
that is available to us through him.

56
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,800
We thank you for it.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,320
As I often pray, Father, but never as a vain repetition,

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,960
may your spirit and your word have free course

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,539
in the moments to follow.

60
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:19,559
For we know this word has the power

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,720
to bring the lost to Christ.

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,199
It has the power to bring the backslidden

63
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,080
back into right relationship,

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,160
and it has the power to bring the saint

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,899
who's walking with you into a closer,

66
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,320
sweeter fellowship with you.

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,639
May your word accomplish its purposes,

68
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,839
I pray in Jesus' name, amen.

69
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,380
Thank you, you may be seated.

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,880
As I read this, and this is that great

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,600
mountain peak passage in the book of Romans.

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,740
You remember the book of Romans, of course,

74
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,720
starting from chapter one and going

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
all the way to chapter eight,

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,380
beginning in the depth, in the dark depth

77
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,720
of the sin of man, beginning in chapter one,

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,080
exposing the depth of the sin of the heathen,

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,800
and going on into chapter two,

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,220
and exposing the hypocrite and the Hebrew,

81
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,079
and concluding in chapter three

82
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,019
with the first crescendos you find

83
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,420
in the book of Romans of how the whole

84
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,339
of humanity is without excuse, is sinful.

85
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,420
There is none righteous, no, not one,

86
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,980
for all have sinned and come short

87
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,660
of the glory of God, and then it continues

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,959
all the way from chapter one to chapter eight,

89
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,579
the most doctrinal book of the Bible,

90
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,779
building on the doctrine of salvation,

91
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,859
of salvation imputed and salvation imparted,

92
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:48,739
and it gets to, all the way up to chapter eight,

93
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,260
we'll go from the depth, let's look

94
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
at that depth for a couple minutes,

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,220
because the contrast might help us

96
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,220
to even appreciate more the height

97
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,820
that we reach by chapter eight.

98
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,380
Of course, chapters nine to 11

99
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,019
deals with a national question,

100
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,859
after all those doctrinal chapters,

101
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,220
and chapter 12, I beseech you, brethren,

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,019
by the mercies of God, et cetera,

103
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,100
present your bodies a living sacrifice,

104
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,980
deals with all the practical stuff

105
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,420
built on that doctrine, but it starts

106
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,059
with the depths of the sin of mankind

107
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,019
and brings us to what we just read.

108
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,459
We'll come back to that in a minute,

109
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,140
but think about the depths of it.

110
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,540
Romans chapter one, just to pull

111
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,299
a few of those verses out,

112
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,579
it speaks in verse 18 of all ungodliness

113
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,500
and the unrighteousness of men.

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,820
It tells us in verse 19, they are without excuse.

115
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,540
It tells us in verse 21, they glorified Him not as God,

116
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,739
neither were thankful,

117
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,700
but became vain in their imagination

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,140
and their foolish hearts was darkened.

119
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,619
I would love to read each part in each phrase,

120
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,260
because one builds upon another upon another,

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,500
exposing the utter sinfulness of man

122
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,380
and how far he has fallen.

123
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,820
It says God gave them also,

124
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,899
also gave them up to uncleanness

125
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,500
through the lust of their own hearts.

126
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,220
I'm in verse 24, to dishonor their own bodies

127
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,380
between themselves.

128
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,619
In verse 25, it tells them they worshiped

129
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,940
and served the creature more than the Creator.

130
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,540
It tells us in verse 26 that they had vile affections.

131
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,899
It says in verse 28 that God gave them over

132
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,420
to a reprobate mind.

133
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,420
And verses 29 to 32 gives one area of sin,

134
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,899
one sin after another after another

135
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,899
in one of the deep sin lists.

136
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,380
That's the condition of the lost.

137
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,619
It's the condition we were all in

138
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,260
before somebody who was called to convey

139
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,579
the love of Christ came and conveyed it to us.

140
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,059
If you're saved tonight,

141
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,940
just praise God for your salvation.

142
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,420
As you may say, well, a lot of those sins weren't me.

143
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
You read through that whole sin list.

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,660
And then if you start looking at that and saying,

145
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,339
well, I kind of grew up in a good home

146
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,859
and I was kind of a moral person,

147
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,019
then go on from chapter one to chapter two

148
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,980
and see thou that judgest.

149
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,899
And continue on until you get to those crescendo

150
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,739
I mentioned.

151
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:14,899
What's the plural of that musician?

152
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:15,899
Crescendi?

153
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,140
Yeah, when you get to them in Romans chapter three

154
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,739
and look at those things and see,

155
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,059
wow, I stood guilty before God

156
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,700
in the same category in the depths.

157
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,019
But because of salvation, hallelujah,

158
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,179
I'm all the way up to the heights.

159
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,299
Called to convey.

160
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,500
Think of a conveyor belt, will you?

161
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,619
For a few moments as we try to have a word picture.

162
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,700
See, I believe this very much,

163
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,380
that after we got saved,

164
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,619
God left us here for a purpose.

165
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:51,579
And a central part of that purpose

166
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,940
is this idea that we're called to convey

167
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,540
the love of Christ.

168
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,660
I mean, why not once we got saved

169
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,859
and baptized, instant glory?

170
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,940
Why would we be kept in a sinful body

171
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,500
on a sinful earth after that we got saved?

172
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,299
We're called to convey the love of Christ.

173
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,899
There will be a day that will come

174
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,380
when the rapture will occur

175
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,019
and every born-again person

176
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,980
indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God

177
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,899
will be removed, will be taken,

178
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,700
will be caught up together

179
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
to meet Him in the air.

180
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,500
And the Holy Spirit will be removed

181
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,420
for that seven-year tribulation.

182
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,579
And the sinful, fallen condition of man

183
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,859
in the heart of the unregenerate

184
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:37,580
with vile affections will have at it.

185
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,979
And the devil will have at it.

186
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,659
Praise God.

187
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,619
We'll be elsewhere.

188
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,500
Think about what He lifted us from.

189
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,179
And so how can we be recipients

190
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,739
of that glorious salvation?

191
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,659
How can we sing saved, saved

192
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,739
and not convey it?

193
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:57,059
Think of a conveyor belt.

194
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,659
You go to the grocery store

195
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:00,020
and you put your groceries on there

196
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
and you put the plastic bar between you

197
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,299
and the person in front of you

198
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,979
and maybe there's someone behind you

199
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,739
and it conveys, it moves,

200
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:10,179
it transports your goods

201
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,380
from one place to another.

202
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,940
You think of a factory,

203
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,900
an assembly line for Emmy and me,

204
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,460
we would always think of

205
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,659
a carousel bringing our luggage.

206
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,419
2017, we came up after many, many hours

207
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:30,940
in a plane and many hours of layovers

208
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,299
and none of our luggage was there.

209
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,140
And I don't particularly want to greet

210
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,659
my family straight out.

211
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,380
After all those hours,

212
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,020
I like to freshen up.

213
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,299
But we had no clothes,

214
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,419
we had no nothing.

215
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,340
We watched that conveyor belt

216
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,820
conveying everybody else's luggage,

217
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,739
moving it from one place to another

218
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,460
and we had nothing

219
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,260
and got greeted by our family members.

220
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,659
Jimmy, you're home, you know, New Jersey.

221
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,539
I've been waiting.

222
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,539
I'm waiting to talk to you, give me a big hug.

223
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,079
When a conveyor belt doesn't convey what it's supposed to,

224
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,099
oh, to think that we would have no Christians here tonight

225
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,619
who would be like that conveyor belt,

226
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:18,459
not conveying what is needed for the person

227
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,559
on the other end of it.

228
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,979
We came this time and we got all our luggage, praise God.

229
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,779
I was so happy, I was so excited.

230
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,219
I ran to get our luggage off,

231
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:29,539
but I had the pouch right here

232
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,339
so I can get the two of them and be He-Man.

233
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,219
I don't want my wife, I love her.

234
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,399
I loved her even before the message this morning,

235
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,739
but I got to love her a little bit more after that.

236
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,499
And I had the pouch.

237
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,699
And I went to the conveyor belt to get them

238
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:42,859
and my pouch went,

239
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:47,319
and it's a big U-shaped post right next to me

240
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:50,299
that I kind of hid into as I tried to grab both bags.

241
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,019
The passports, the COVID documentation,

242
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,699
all the things we need to get through there

243
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,099
and not be quarantined or stopped or sent back

244
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,899
were all of a sudden in a place I couldn't get to them.

245
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,339
And this big old boy wasn't gonna get up

246
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,699
on that conveyor belt and go with the luggage

247
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,179
and try to reach in there.

248
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,699
And I was about to say, Emmy, and I thought, no, no, no.

249
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,719
If I do that, I'll be Pastor Man's illustration

250
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,379
of a husband who doesn't love his wife.

251
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,979
And so I got this security person and asked him,

252
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:18,859
can you please help me?

253
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:23,339
That little black and white pouch in there is my life.

254
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,659
And so he got up on there and he went through it once

255
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,339
and had to come around again before he could actually get it

256
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,659
has nothing to do with the sermon,

257
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,459
but I thought I'd just mention that.

258
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,699
I wasn't quite ready to receive those bags.

259
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:38,459
In fact, I not only lost the pouch,

260
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,319
I didn't get the bags until the next time around,

261
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,699
but that conveyor belt kept conveying the bags

262
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,579
until I was ready to receive them.

263
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,099
And so I would just say, church, we are called to convey,

264
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,939
whether that's in the Samoan Islands,

265
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:58,259
way out in the middle of the South Pacific.

266
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,219
I like this map of the South Pacific

267
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,399
because it shows Pacific Ocean on both sides.

268
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,459
I could put two marks on that map to show where we are.

269
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,379
But whether the love of Christ is conveyed

270
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,019
all the way out to tiny little islands on Samoa

271
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,799
or right here in your area,

272
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,059
I would say every one of us is called to convey.

273
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:23,339
And so the idea tonight, the challenge tonight,

274
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,019
the message tonight is let us be superb conveyors

275
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,739
of the love of Christ.

276
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,619
And I got thinking about that and I said,

277
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,699
you know, there are three times that particular phrase.

278
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,959
One of my very favorite hymns is the love of God.

279
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,819
That's just, oh, that fourth verse, that poetry of it.

280
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,499
Just such a beautiful hymn.

281
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:49,499
But I caught my attention for the first time last month,

282
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,059
love of Christ, and I got looking at it.

283
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,819
And I found, as I studied the three passages,

284
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,499
I found three different aspects of what

285
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,899
will make a person to become a superb conveyor

286
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,019
of the love of Christ.

287
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,259
And so those are the three we're gonna look at.

288
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,779
The first one, I'll put them in the form of questions

289
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,099
for us tonight.

290
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:15,779
Number one, am I confident in the love of Christ?

291
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,779
See, a person who is confident in the love of Christ

292
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,459
is a superb conveyor of it.

293
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,699
When you love something and you're confident in that,

294
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:26,879
you will brag about it.

295
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,059
You go to a good restaurant.

296
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,179
The Smiths took us to The Lazy Dog

297
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,379
when they sent me the email when I was up in New Jersey

298
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,099
and they said, we're gonna go to a restaurant

299
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,379
called The Lazy Dog.

300
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,219
I thought, hmm.

301
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,819
The name doesn't exactly sell it,

302
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:44,939
but they said it was good.

303
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,739
And several other people told me it was good.

304
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,179
And we went there and they told me

305
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:49,659
what was good on the menu.

306
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,099
And we had a great time and I enjoyed the food.

307
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,819
And they've been there a couple times.

308
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,539
And you know, if you go to a restaurant a few times

309
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,299
and the food's really good,

310
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:03,299
you'll be confident to talk about it, amen?

311
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,379
You'll be confident to tell someone about it.

312
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,379
I'm not gonna go and say,

313
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,639
well, I don't know if I'm intellectual enough

314
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,779
to talk about how great the restaurant is

315
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,459
or I'm too fat to go up to somebody

316
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,899
and start talking to them about how great the restaurant is.

317
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:16,819
No, I've gone there.

318
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,299
The waiter was good.

319
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,699
Or in our case, the waitress.

320
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:20,979
The food was good to this.

321
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,859
And I've gone there two, three, four times.

322
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,979
And every time they got it right.

323
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:27,099
And I'm not worried what you think.

324
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,019
I'm too short.

325
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,219
I'm too tall.

326
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,059
I'm too.

327
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,099
I hope the point is coming through.

328
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,539
Because many people say,

329
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,899
I don't feel confident enough to go out throwing

330
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,259
to pass out tracks to talk about the Lord.

331
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,339
I don't have this, I don't have that.

332
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,179
I'm not gifted.

333
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,659
I'm not this, I'm not that.

334
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:47,459
If you're so confident in the love of Christ,

335
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,259
it'll just ooze out of you.

336
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,899
A salesman knows that if he's got a junky product,

337
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,659
it's hard to sell.

338
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,299
He's gotta lie or cheat or steal or exaggerate

339
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,419
or try to convince you to need something you don't.

340
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,619
But a salesman who has a great product

341
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,079
that will change your life, that will really help you,

342
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,579
boy, he can sell that to you all day long.

343
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,339
How about us?

344
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:15,099
Are you that confident in the love of Christ?

345
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:17,019
I'm not talking about self-confidence.

346
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,819
You know, when I get up to preach, I preach.

347
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,699
I probably look kinda confident,

348
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,879
but it's not self-confidence.

349
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,979
I'm not a confident guy.

350
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:25,939
I go around with my shoulders sagging.

351
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:28,059
I'm worried about what they think about my appearance

352
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,699
and I have this self-consciousness stuff going on

353
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,099
and I over-apologize.

354
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,339
I'm just not one of those people

355
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,539
who carries himself with a lot of self-confidence.

356
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,399
But when I'm up preaching, I'm not preaching gym.

357
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,139
I'm not trying to convince you about gym.

358
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,939
I'm getting up to preach the word of God

359
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,779
and I have absolute confidence in the word of God.

360
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,139
And when I wanna preach to somebody who might be lost,

361
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,419
I have absolute confidence of the love of Christ for them.

362
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,499
I could get the focus off of gym.

363
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,619
It's funny that I'm saying that while the focus is on him,

364
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:02,599
but you get my point.

365
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,479
Look at the passage.

366
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:07,539
Now, come back to the end of Romans chapter eight.

367
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,699
Come back to the mountain peak with me.

368
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,039
Read it, come back to it often.

369
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,879
Go visit.

370
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,099
You don't have to go look for some mountain

371
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,139
with a wizard on top.

372
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,859
Go to Romans chapter eight and read that.

373
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:22,219
It's a fantastic question with a fantastic answer.

374
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:26,379
Who shall separate me from the love of Christ?

375
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,099
I tell you, that'll take care of you.

376
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,899
You've been abused, you've been abandoned,

377
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,619
you've been this, you've been that.

378
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,299
Life has been hard on you.

379
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:37,299
You just go to the mountain and say,

380
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:42,039
none of that stuff separates me from the love of Christ.

381
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:44,979
He loves me.

382
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:47,699
His Calvary love is so great.

383
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,579
He loves me when I'm at my lowest.

384
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,459
He loves me when I am at my weakest.

385
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,699
He loves me when I messed up, when I failed,

386
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,399
when I stumbled, when I fell,

387
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
when I've denied him three times.

388
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,819
Go tell Peter and the disciples.

389
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,939
And Peter, two beautiful words in the Bible.

390
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,559
I get confident in his love.

391
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:13,779
Who shall separate us?

392
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,739
Tribulation, et cetera, et cetera.

393
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:16,939
I don't need to read that.

394
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,819
But if you just stop at verse 36,

395
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,699
you're gonna be messed up.

396
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,259
Are you with me tonight, church?

397
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,559
We're back in Romans chapter eight.

398
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,039
I hope we have time to get to the other two passages

399
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,219
because they're fantastic too.

400
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,819
But this one, who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

401
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,979
It says in verse 36, as it is written,

402
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:38,739
for thy sake we are killed all the day long.

403
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,899
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

404
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,939
And there's a period there.

405
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,499
But I wanna beg of you not to stop at that period

406
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:51,599
and keep reading on.

407
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,379
Church, let me say this tonight.

408
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:56,739
Never, ever, ever cast yourself as a victim.

409
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,139
You are a victor.

410
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,059
I know the world in which we live in.

411
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,879
Yes, it's waxing worse and worse.

412
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:05,099
Yes, I could gripe all day long about the mainstream media

413
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,339
and about the politics of this and these things going on

414
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,719
and the freedoms that are stripped.

415
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,259
I can talk to you about the events

416
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,019
that were commemorated yesterday

417
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,979
that speak of a hatred for this country and attacks on it.

418
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,539
I could speak of current events

419
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,539
and I could whine all day long.

420
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,379
And you know what?

421
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,399
Too many Christians are doing exactly that.

422
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,419
Their social media is filled with things

423
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,219
about this person and that person

424
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,699
and this politics and that politics.

425
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,019
Where's the love of Christ?

426
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,339
Let's flood, if any of you are on social media,

427
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:38,779
flood those things with the love of Christ and stop whining.

428
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,039
It's so hard to be a Christian now in these days.

429
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,059
America used to be a Christian nation,

430
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,079
but now we're going down

431
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,380
and I don't think we could ever have revival.

432
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,440
And all day long, we are accounting a sheep

433
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,519
for the slaughter, period, full stop, done.

434
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,079
Please read the next word.

435
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,959
The first word in the next verse, what does it say?

436
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,019
Nay.

437
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:06,099
No, that is not the perspective on the mountaintop.

438
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,500
That is not the perspective when you have come

439
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,299
and learned of salvation and you've begun to understand

440
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,779
how it was imputed and how it's imparted

441
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,779
and how it's expressed through you

442
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,619
and how you have the spirit of God dwelling in you.

443
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,339
Nay.

444
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:25,019
And all these things and peril and tribulation

445
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:27,059
and this and that and attacks.

446
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,339
We are more than conquerors.

447
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,179
That kind of love gives me confidence.

448
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,459
Amen.

449
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,500
That kind of love gives me confidence

450
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,219
even when the news reports and the Supreme Court decisions

451
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:41,820
and the what and the what and the this

452
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,059
and the rigged election and the what and whatever.

453
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,859
However your politics are oriented

454
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,539
and all that kind of stuff, nay.

455
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,659
And all this, we are more than conquerors.

456
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,459
Are you that confident in the love of Christ?

457
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,059
See, that gets your eyes off yourself.

458
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,859
That gets you not worried about confidence in yourself.

459
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:06,179
self-confidence. Paul said, he doesn't count any of that, he has no confidence in the

460
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:14,819
flesh, but his confidence in the love of Christ is great. How about ours? You get

461
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:20,379
so confident, I'm going through depression, but he still loves me. I'm

462
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,979
going through a broken home, I'm going through this situation, I'm going through

463
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:29,259
that situation, whatever it may be, but in one thing I can be absolutely confident.

464
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:37,779
Nothing, no one shall separate me from the love of Christ. The devil is a liar

465
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:44,979
from the beginning and he will attack that all day long, but you could stand

466
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:52,139
firmly wherever you are and say, I am confident in the love of Christ. Nay, in

467
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:55,259
all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us, for

468
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:02,659
I am persuaded, I have been convinced absolutely, and therefore I have absolute

469
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:07,459
confidence that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, etc., nor

470
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:13,379
height, nor depth, etc., shall be able to separate us from the love of God. So in

471
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:18,539
this section it begins with the love of Christ and then it goes down to the love

472
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:31,259
of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. You cannot be a superb conveyor of the

473
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:38,099
love of Christ if you're not confident in it. Place your confidence there and it

474
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:44,819
will just come flowing out. Please do not think this is a sloppy agape message, oh

475
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,099
the love of Christ and I just think about the love of Christ and I'm just

476
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:52,419
gonna go around all day long and give smiley tracks, just joking pastor, and

477
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:56,779
just talk about the love of Christ and it's all fluffy and and gooey and agape.

478
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:02,579
Oh praise God it is sweet and it is wonderful. But the next passage we're

479
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,979
going to look at is in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5. 2nd Corinthians chapter 5, I

480
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:15,099
want to start up at verse 9 and lead up to verse 14 and even include verse 15. So

481
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:19,739
number one, am I confident in the love of Christ? If I am, I'm positioned to be a

482
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:28,339
superb conveyor. Number two, am I constrained by the love of Christ? Are

483
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:32,459
you constrained by the love of Christ? Look at the passage with me,

484
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:37,419
wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for

485
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,419
we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive

486
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,779
the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good

487
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:53,499
or bad knowing therefore the terror of the Lord. Let me stop for a second. I'm

488
00:22:53,499 --> 00:23:01,179
looking at this and I'm seeing in verse 9 labor, work. I'm seeing in verse 10 the

489
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:07,179
judgment seat of Christ. I'm seeing in verse 11 the terror of the Lord. I'm

490
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:12,339
looking at the context that leads up to the Apostle Paul saying to the

491
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:20,059
Corinthians, for the love of Christ constraineth us. Well I kind of prefer the

492
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:23,699
newer versions because they say compelled and that's easier to understand and I

493
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:30,019
think it's a better word. It compels us. No it's not. Constrained is absolutely the

494
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:39,939
word. It's the word that means being pressed in on every side. It's the word

495
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:44,219
that refers to a ship trying to get through a narrow strait and it must stay

496
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:48,459
right in its lane to get through without being harmed. It's the word that means

497
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:53,859
armies pressing you on every side. It's the word used for, and this is the word

498
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:57,819
picture I want to park on for a minute, it's the word used for a cattle or a

499
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:04,779
sheep shoot. Have you ever seen one of them where they run all the cattle

500
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:08,579
through it and it's like these barricades or these fences and there are

501
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,619
these paths they have to go through. It's time to take the cows to go to graze

502
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,939
because they need to be fed. Flip open that one they go that way. It removes the

503
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:22,459
distractions and it provides the direction. The love of Christ

504
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:31,019
constraineth us. And see if you have a sloppy, non-biblical, theologically weak

505
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,500
view of the love of Christ, it's just something we receive and it makes us

506
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,939
feel good and I'm glad I'm saved and going to heaven. Give me the remote. If

507
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:45,259
you have a shallow view of the love of Christ, you won't be a superb conveyor of

508
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:49,339
it. You may say, oh I'm so confident. I know for sure. I know for a fact. Someone

509
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,979
knocks on my door to ask me, do you know if you died today you'd go to heaven? I

510
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:57,619
absolutely know it because I said the prayer and got saved. And that's the

511
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:03,899
whole depth of the love of Christ. They haven't begun to experience the love of

512
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:10,359
Christ. The Apostle Paul said, for the love of Christ constraineth us. Does it

513
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,379
constrain you? Well, does the love of Christ remove a whole bunch of

514
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,859
distractions and provide direction? Bring the sheep through. No, send them over

515
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:23,939
there to graze. No, send them this way because this is the time to shear their

516
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:28,259
wool, can be beneficial and helpful to people and clothe people and protect

517
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:34,219
people. And they've run through that. See, if you have this sloppy type of thing

518
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:39,339
and you don't have the experience of the love of Christ constraining you, you're

519
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:44,259
not a superb conveyor of it. And so we have the local New Testament Church and

520
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:48,219
what does the preacher try to do? He's not preaching do this, do this, do this to

521
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:51,579
build an empire. The preacher isn't preaching that to make you a good

522
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,979
little Christian girl and a good little Christian boy and to have all these

523
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:58,899
rules to follow. And if you do enough of them, you might please God. The love of

524
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:04,179
Christ, nothing's going to separate you from it, but it will constrain you. It

525
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,699
will remove you from certain things you used to watch. It will remove you from

526
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:14,500
certain things you used to listen to. It will block off certain associations you

527
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,739
used to participate in. It will constrain you. Does the love of Christ have a

528
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:26,219
constraining influence in your life? And that's why I went to the verses up above.

529
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:32,539
It says, for we labor, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, etc. The

530
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:39,419
love of Christ constrains us to serve. See, I've been called to convey and I can

531
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:44,459
convey the love of Christ because I'm so confident in it, but it takes work.

532
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:50,500
Amen? You can't have this mentality, well, I hope they extend the unemployment a

533
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,339
little bit longer so I could stay home more because I'm making more at home

534
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:58,619
than if I went to the workplace. That's not a good way to convey. You are not a

535
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,659
superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you're the laziest person in your

536
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:06,619
workplace. Well, it's just a government job, you know, you can get away with this

537
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:09,539
and that, and I don't want to work too hard and get the others in the office

538
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:17,859
upset with me. You're not a good conveyor. Your conveyor belt isn't working. Amen?

539
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:23,339
Christian people ought to be the hardest working people because they're

540
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,939
constrained. So wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we may be

541
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:32,299
accepted of him, for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

542
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:38,859
Time prevents me from turning to the passage, but you know it. Well, you will

543
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,939
be judged as a believer. We know unbelievers, different judgment

544
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:47,379
altogether, white throne. We don't need to talk about it. But we'll be judged at the

545
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,259
bema seat of Christ for our works, what we've done in the body, whether it's good

546
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:57,219
or bad, we'll be judged. Is it wood? Hay? Stubble? Etc. That's something that ought

547
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:02,659
to grip the mind of a Christian and say, I know that I'm saved, I know I'll never

548
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:10,379
be judged for my sin. That judgment was settled for the believer by the love of

549
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:18,459
Christ on Calvary. But I will face a judgment for my works, for what I do, for

550
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:23,859
how I serve him. And don't make your pastor or someone else beg you to get in

551
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:28,899
his employ. Say, the love of Christ will constrain me. I don't have to worry about

552
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:33,419
how confident I am I can do it. I will just be available and I'll get plugged

553
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,979
in for the cause of Christ, because the love of Christ constrains me to do that.

554
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:45,700
And that's something to think about. What will the love of Christ constrain you to

555
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:54,219
do? And what will it constrain you from doing? I'm not the Holy Spirit. I'm a

556
00:28:54,219 --> 00:29:02,940
preacher. But the Holy Spirit can point out to you exactly what things he wants

557
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,859
to constrain you from doing. He may just be wanting to reorganize your time

558
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:14,779
management. He may just be saying you don't need to go down the Facebook rabbit

559
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:20,539
hole for an hour at a time. He may just be saying you don't need to binge watch

560
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,859
this program because everybody else is. He might be saying to someone you don't

561
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:32,979
need to be on the video game or the this or the that that much time. You need to

562
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:40,459
be plugged in for the cause of Christ, because this world is populated with

563
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,899
people who need the love of Christ. What will he constrain you from doing that is

564
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:52,739
filling your time? I remember Edgar says in Proverbs chapter 30, remove far from

565
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:59,179
me vanity and lies. Oh Lord remove far from me empty empty things that have no

566
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,619
impact on eternity.

567
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:10,619
Remove those far from me, the idea of let me fill my time with things that are useful for the cause of Christ.

568
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:14,619
Are you a superb conveyor of the love of Christ?

569
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,739
We'll go to our third point.

570
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,739
Do I comprehend the love of Christ?

571
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:27,419
Would you turn to this beautiful reading in Ephesians chapter three with me?

572
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:39,419
Ephesians chapter three, verse 14 to 19, our last passage, our third time, going in order of appearance in the word of God of the love of Christ.

573
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:44,619
One of the beautiful times where the Apostle Paul prays for one of the churches.

574
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:47,219
Here he says, starting in verse 14,

575
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,419
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

576
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:59,219
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory.

577
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,219
Oh my church, how I want to park there and ponder that.

578
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,219
Time doesn't allow but come back to that.

579
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,219
The riches of his grace, the riches of his glory, the riches of his mercy.

580
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,219
Oh, those are wonderful thoughts to ponder.

581
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:20,219
But he said that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man.

582
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:28,019
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,

583
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:37,019
may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height.

584
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:41,019
I would recommend that you underline all four of those dimensions.

585
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:49,019
And say, do I comprehend the love of Christ?

586
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,819
See, you will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you are absolutely confident in it,

587
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,819
that nothing can separate you from it.

588
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:03,819
You will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you allow the Spirit of God to give you direction,

589
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,819
constrain you from going in certain directions and doing certain things,

590
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,819
and directing you in certain paths.

591
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:15,819
And you will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ as you increase in your comprehension.

592
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:19,619
My wife can teach a rock to read.

593
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:24,619
She's incredible at what she does with those kids, and she's teaching them to read in English,

594
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,619
but she knows that she could teach them from a very young age to be little automatons,

595
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:32,619
to be little robots just reading, and it could sound good.

596
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:35,619
Jane and Spot went to... whatever.

597
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:41,619
And they could just say it, but she knows questions, questions, questions, comprehension questions,

598
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:43,619
because they could read it and not know what they said.

599
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:46,419
Bob threw Jane the ball.

600
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,419
What did Bob do?

601
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:51,419
Bob went home.

602
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,419
They could answer something that has nothing to do with what they read,

603
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:56,419
because they don't have comprehension.

604
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:59,419
And she works on them, and she works on them, and she works on them,

605
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,419
so that they're not only reading, but they're comprehending,

606
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:06,419
so that by the time they even get to first grade, they can read those simple sentences

607
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:09,419
and understand what they're reading and build on that.

608
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:12,419
And she's done incredible work with it.

609
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,220
I remember back when I was an English teacher,

610
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,220
I was teaching the pre-college class in American Samoa,

611
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,220
and I knew that these students, if they came to the United States to university,

612
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,220
they wouldn't be ready, and so I started having them read things

613
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,220
that would be a real challenge for them,

614
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,220
and we had deer time, drop everything and read.

615
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:34,220
And I started giving them Dickens and stuff that was above,

616
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,220
and they had to have a dictionary, and they would read,

617
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,220
and then afterwards we would talk about it,

618
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,220
and they would moan, groan, gripe, and complain.

619
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,019
Oh, Mr. Jim, I don't understand what I'm reading.

620
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,019
I can't get this.

621
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,019
Just read it.

622
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,019
If you don't know a word, get the dictionary out.

623
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,019
We'll talk about it afterwards.

624
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,019
This is deer time.

625
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,019
No talking.

626
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,019
And I did that day after day, and the tension kind of built,

627
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,019
and built in one wonderful day.

628
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,019
Pai, sitting in that corner of the classroom,

629
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,019
it was silent as anything, and she said,

630
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,019
Mr. Jim, Mr. Jim, I read the whole page,

631
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,019
and I understood the whole thing.

632
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,019
That's a teacher moment.

633
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,019
I want to say to you tonight,

634
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,019
I might steal a couple extra minutes,

635
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,019
because we have to scratch the surface on this.

636
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,019
We need Christians in the pews,

637
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,019
on the streets, in the community,

638
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,019
who have a high level of comprehension.

639
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,019
We don't need just first grade level of comprehension,

640
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,019
even third or fifth grade.

641
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,019
We need to be high school.

642
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,019
We need to be college.

643
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,019
We need to be post graduates.

644
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:44,820
We need people who are PhDs in the love of Christ,

645
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,820
where your understanding is increasing.

646
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,820
We will never fully comprehend this side of heaven,

647
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:55,820
the height, the depth, the breadth,

648
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,820
the length of the love of Christ.

649
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,820
But we could keep going up.

650
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,820
And the more you comprehend it,

651
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,619
oh, the more you'll share it.

652
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,619
You'll just long for people.

653
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,619
Even if we don't take the kindergartner

654
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,619
and expect them to be reading on university level,

655
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,619
we're fine with Bob.

656
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,619
Bob is big.

657
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,619
And somehow they have a hard time with the Bs and Ps,

658
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,619
so they mess that up.

659
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,619
Pop is pig.

660
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,619
And we have to teach him the B and the P sound.

661
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,619
You get some funny things that come out.

662
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,619
I remember the radio announcer back then,

663
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,619
it was some years ago,

664
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:35,419
but he would always say,

665
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,419
President Push.

666
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,419
I said, what was President Push we heard about day after day?

667
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,419
It was the Bs and Ps.

668
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:44,419
But you don't go to the kindergartner

669
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,419
and expect them to have law degrees or medical degrees

670
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,419
and be able to read things at that level.

671
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,419
Oh, but you want them to be able to start reading

672
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,419
and add to it more and more.

673
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,419
If you really want to begin just a little bit

674
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,419
to understand these four dimensions,

675
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:08,220
go back to Ephesians chapter 2

676
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:14,220
and start looking.

677
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,220
There are four dimensions given.

678
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:19,220
I'm not going to do them in the order that they say in that verse.

679
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,220
They say breadth, length, depth, and height.

680
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:23,220
Let's start with the depth.

681
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:26,220
This will be very easy because we already read Romans chapter 1

682
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,220
and pulled out all those things.

683
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,220
But look in Ephesians chapter 2.

684
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,019
And you hath he quickened made alive

685
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,019
who were dead in trespasses and sin,

686
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,019
wherein in time past

687
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,019
ye walked according to the course of this world.

688
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,019
See, all three enemies.

689
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,019
There's the world.

690
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,019
According to the prince and the power of the air.

691
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,019
There's the devil.

692
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,019
And the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

693
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,019
among whom also we had all our conversation

694
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,019
in time past in the lust of our flesh.

695
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,019
Oh, look at those three enemies.

696
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,019
Look at the hopeless soul

697
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,820
who's dead, dead in their trespasses and sins.

698
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:05,820
The Calvinists like to take this passage and distort it

699
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,820
and say that the person has no involvement whatsoever

700
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,820
in responding, so the implication is

701
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,820
why go out and give a track and try to lead them to the Lord.

702
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,820
No, they're dead like Adam and Eve were dead when they were cast away.

703
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,820
They were dead in their spirit.

704
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:22,820
And when you're dead in your spirit,

705
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,820
the three enemies, the internal, the external, the infernal enemy

706
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,820
have their way with you

707
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,820
and keep you apart from God

708
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,820
and you're in the depth and you're helpless.

709
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,820
Oh, but that there would be people who would come

710
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,820
and convey the love of Christ

711
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,820
and that the Holy Spirit can work from the outside

712
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:42,820
and you could be quickened and made alive again.

713
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,820
I want you to think, Christian,

714
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,820
just for a few moments tonight about these dimensions.

715
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:50,820
Think about how deep he reached.

716
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,820
Think of the depths of his love.

717
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,820
He who was seated in the heavenly places.

718
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:56,820
He in the Godhead.

719
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,619
He who is complete said,

720
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,619
I'll go to a sin-cursed earth.

721
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,619
I'll walk those dusty roads.

722
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,619
I'll walk among those men who are sinful

723
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,619
and receive everything they throw at me.

724
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,619
A wine-bibber and a drunkard

725
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,619
and the piercing and the crucifixion.

726
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,619
The lies, the false witness.

727
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,619
I'll go among them.

728
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,419
You will begin to comprehend the love of Christ

729
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,419
when you start to think of how deep he reached

730
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,419
to pull you up.

731
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,419
I can only scratch the surface.

732
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,419
My time is really up in one minute,

733
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,419
but I'm going to steal five more.

734
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,419
Amen.

735
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,419
Oh, he reached deep.

736
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:46,419
Now think about the heights.

737
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:47,419
Just keep reading.

738
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,419
I can't not read verse 4.

739
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,419
My goodness.

740
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,419
But God, hallelujah,

741
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:55,219
is rich in mercy for his great love

742
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,219
with where he loved us.

743
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,219
Even when we were dead in sins,

744
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,219
hath quickened us together with Christ.

745
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:03,219
For by grace are you saved.

746
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:07,219
Now see the height in verse 6.

747
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:10,219
And hath raised us up together

748
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:14,219
and made us to sit together in heavenly places.

749
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,219
That moment that he reached down

750
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:21,219
and you who were dead in trespasses and sins,

751
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,219
he quickened.

752
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:26,020
He lifted you as high as you can go.

753
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:27,020
Amen.

754
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:30,020
He brought you to be seated in heavenly places.

755
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:31,020
If you want to ponder that,

756
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,020
go to Isaiah chapter 6

757
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,020
and look at the throne.

758
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,020
Look at them saying,

759
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,020
Holy, holy, holy.

760
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,020
And see how high that is and say,

761
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:43,020
I'm seated there already

762
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,020
in my position.

763
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,020
Hallelujah.

764
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,020
Go to Revelation chapter 1

765
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,020
and see Christ revealed in his glory.

766
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:51,020
Not in his robe.

767
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,820
Not in his dusty sandals

768
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,820
that they have to clean his feet.

769
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,820
But see him in Revelation chapter 1

770
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,820
and then go to Revelation chapter 4

771
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,820
and chapter 5

772
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,820
and see that glorious,

773
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,820
exalted,

774
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,340
Seen and realized the love of Christ

775
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,620
has such height that He brought me up to that.

776
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,740
I was meant to go to the deepest, farthest place

777
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,220
separated eternally from God.

778
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh, but Christian who is saved,

779
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,700
who shall separate us from the love of God?

780
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,860
You start to grow in your comprehension

781
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,620
of the depth of His love

782
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,380
and how low it reached

783
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,020
and how high it brought you.

784
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,420
Oh, and now think of the length of it.

785
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,340
Look still in verse 6, now into verse 7,

786
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,580
that in the ages to come,

787
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,780
He might show the exceeding riches of His grace

788
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,180
and His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

789
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Oh, the love of Christ is long.

790
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,500
I've had people stand before an altar

791
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,020
and say, I do,

792
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,780
as I married them, but they didn't.

793
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,860
It lasted a while, but they didn't.

794
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,660
I've had in my own life experience

795
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,660
a biological mother who just left,

796
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,540
tore me up as a child.

797
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,220
That's the one who's supposed to love you

798
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,660
all the way through.

799
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,900
That's not a self-pity party.

800
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,780
That's the love of Christ.

801
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,100
Amen.

802
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,700
But there is love in this world,

803
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,540
even love that we might think

804
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,220
ought to be most reflective of that love,

805
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,900
but it's not.

806
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,860
You could have a friend that you've poured yourself into

807
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,140
in friendship and loving devotion

808
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,660
to this person as a friend,

809
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
and then something happens

810
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,740
and the relationship is broken,

811
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,220
never to be repaired.

812
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,580
Not so with the love of Christ.

813
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,620
It's long that in the ages to come,

814
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,180
that throughout eternity,

815
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,100
He's lifted you so high,

816
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,380
and that love of Christ lasts forever.

817
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,060
We shall forever in heaven

818
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,140
be the envy of angels

819
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,380
because of our redemption

820
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,340
and our exalted position.

821
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,540
Have we made it to sixth grade yet?

822
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,940
Can we get our comprehension level?

823
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,020
Maybe let's get up to high school.

824
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,020
And how about the breadth?

825
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,100
See, I really, really appreciate this church.

826
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,700
I'm not just buttering anybody up.

827
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,020
I really appreciate what this church has done for me

828
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,180
over the last few years

829
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,020
that we've been partnering together.

830
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,700
The faithful support, the prayers,

831
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,780
the encouragement, the huge gifts,

832
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,700
the belief in what God is doing

833
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,980
through such people as us.

834
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,140
I really appreciate Jennifer coming out

835
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,540
on the missions trip

836
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,420
and seeing our work firsthand

837
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
and being there.

838
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,300
And the truth is,

839
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,220
I would like to take you as a church

840
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,660
and hug you.

841
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
I'd like to embrace you.

842
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,020
I'd like to reach around all of you.

843
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
And some of you are like, uh-uh.

844
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,300
And then we see how sweaty you are right now too.

845
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,740
That's a double uh-uh.

846
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,060
I thought I heard Scooby.

847
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,820
That's what I thought I heard.

848
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,900
But church, I don't have that embrace.

849
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,300
But you keep reading in Ephesians 2,

850
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,220
and that wall of partition was removed.

851
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,900
And His embrace reached to the worst.

852
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,780
Even with vile affections

853
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,820
that burned in their lust

854
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,780
one toward another,

855
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,340
working that which is inseemly.

856
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,340
His embrace reached every single one of them.

857
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,100
Those who worship the creature

858
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,380
more than the Creator.

859
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,100
If they just but turned

860
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,700
and received His love.

861
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,220
Oh, what a reach.

862
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,260
To the uttermost parts of the earth.

863
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,580
And then He went to the other side.

864
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,020
And He took the Hebrew.

865
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,580
He took the one who they thought

866
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,700
they were just in the pocket of the divine,

867
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,820
judging everyone else,

868
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,180
but they were lost too.

869
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,740
And He said in those verses,

870
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,740
it's the same thing,

871
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,580
that if thou shalt confess

872
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
with thy mouth and believe

873
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,540
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

874
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,740
For whosoever,

875
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,180
whosoever,

876
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,780
what an embrace.

877
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,260
His arms, the breadth,

878
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,060
we would say width,

879
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,140
of His love is so great.

880
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,860
What if we said right here tonight,

881
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,900
oh Lord,

882
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,460
I will grab onto the love of Christ

883
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,540
with such confidence

884
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,580
that it cannot be shaken.

885
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,860
And when I doubt myself

886
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,380
and I doubt my circumstances

887
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,020
and I doubt this and I doubt that,

888
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,860
I will not doubt the love of Christ.

889
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,140
I will go to the mountaintop

890
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,540
of Romans chapter eight.

891
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,179
What if we said tonight,

892
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,300
Pastor in just a second,

893
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,339
I'm gonna just ask you to come

894
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,540
and take the whole invitation.

895
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,779
What if tonight,

896
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,779
the Holy Spirit spoke to you

897
00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:31,420
and someone would say,

898
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,980
oh, Holy Spirit of God,

899
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,059
constrain me from this

900
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:39,460
or to do that.

901
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:43,660
We need missionaries in the Samoan islands,

902
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,619
but there are just not enough people

903
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,420
who are so constrained

904
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,980
by the Spirit of God,

905
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,980
by the love of Christ to go.

906
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,860
I'm convinced of that.

907
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,899
I'm not saying it's one of you,

908
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,740
could be.

909
00:44:55,899 --> 00:44:58,100
What if you would say tonight,

910
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,940
oh Father,

911
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,779
oh Spirit of God,

912
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:04,460
increase my comprehension

913
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,580
for all the education.

914
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,339
Some of you may have an education

915
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:09,619
in advanced degrees and professions

916
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,779
and you may be very knowledgeable

917
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:13,980
in law and medicine and engineering

918
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,220
and this or that.

919
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,179
But you would say,

920
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,619
the most important degree I want

921
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,580
is a full comprehension

922
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,820
to the measure I can

923
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,460
this side of heaven,

924
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,980
of the love of Christ

925
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,580
so that I can be a superb conveyor.

926
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,660
Father, we thank you, Lord,

927
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
for your word.

928
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,820
We thank you that you would even allow us

929
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,300
to be vessels to convey your love.

930
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,140
And I pray, Father,

931
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,420
that you would do that work

932
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,380
that only you can do.

933
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,300
In Jesus' name, amen.

934
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,619
Amen, would you stand with me?

935
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,140
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

936
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,660
We're gonna play quietly on the piano.

937
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,100
What a great challenge

938
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,460
from the word of God.

939
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,460
I'm so thankful for the love of Christ.
