WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.119
their care for us, most hospitable, and we're so grateful.

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.599
I thank you this morning, but I will thank you again

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.680
as you're opening to Romans chapter eight.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.119
Thank you for the lovely home we have while we're here.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.120
I jokingly said to Pastor Mann that our two days

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.100
might just be extended to six months.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.879
We're so comfortable there, but thank you very much.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.020
You are certainly a great blessing to us.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.860
Thank you for your very faithful support

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.099
and for very substantial gifts, offerings,

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:38.060
given to the ministry, not only for the Bible efforts,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.139
but for the church planting efforts.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:43.540
You have come through truly in Herculean fashion

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.259
this last year, and we are very, very grateful for that.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:51.380
So please continue to keep those things in prayer.

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:57.700
Our message tonight is called to convey,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.939
called to convey.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.740
We're gonna start with one reading.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.139
There are actually three readings,

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:08.260
and they are the only three times you find the phrase

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.220
love of Christ in the Bible.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.819
Love of God is a more common expression,

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.300
but this specific phrase, love of Christ.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.860
And so let's begin with Romans chapter eight,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.860
those wonderful, climactic, mountaintop verses

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.260
at the end of that chapter.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.180
Romans chapter eight, verses 35 to 39.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.040
And I don't even recall from this morning

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.919
if it's the practice of the church or not,

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:39.139
but if you're able, would you stand with me

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.540
for the reading of God's word,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.260
then we'll make a prayer and be seated.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.779
Romans chapter eight, verses 35 to 39.

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:49.660
Let's just read those all together.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.919
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:58.720
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.720
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.919
As it is written, for thy sake we are killed

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.679
all the day long.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.839
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.940
Nay, in all those things we are more than conquerors

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.279
through him that loved us.

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.160
For I am persuaded that neither death,

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.360
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.080
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.360
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.360
shall be able to separate us from the love of God

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.520
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.759
Father, I thank you for the reading of your word.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.880
I thank you that we live in a country

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.119
that is still free, that we can gather

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.639
and worship you, and praise you, read your scriptures,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.440
and speak freely of your son, our savior,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.039
the Lord Jesus Christ, and the salvation

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.399
that is available to us through him.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:06.800
We thank you for it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.320
As I often pray, Father, but never as a vain repetition,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.960
may your spirit and your word have free course

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.539
in the moments to follow.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.559
For we know this word has the power

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.720
to bring the lost to Christ.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.199
It has the power to bring the backslidden

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.080
back into right relationship,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.160
and it has the power to bring the saint

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.899
who's walking with you into a closer,

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.320
sweeter fellowship with you.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.639
May your word accomplish its purposes,

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.839
I pray in Jesus' name, amen.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.380
Thank you, you may be seated.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.880
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.880
As I read this, and this is that great

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.600
mountain peak passage in the book of Romans.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.740
You remember the book of Romans, of course,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.720
starting from chapter one and going

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.800
all the way to chapter eight,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.380
beginning in the depth, in the dark depth

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.720
of the sin of man, beginning in chapter one,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.080
exposing the depth of the sin of the heathen,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.800
and going on into chapter two,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.220
and exposing the hypocrite and the Hebrew,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.079
and concluding in chapter three

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.019
with the first crescendos you find

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.420
in the book of Romans of how the whole

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.339
of humanity is without excuse, is sinful.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:30.420
There is none righteous, no, not one,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.980
for all have sinned and come short

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.660
of the glory of God, and then it continues

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.959
all the way from chapter one to chapter eight,

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.579
the most doctrinal book of the Bible,

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.779
building on the doctrine of salvation,

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.859
of salvation imputed and salvation imparted,

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:48.739
and it gets to, all the way up to chapter eight,

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:50.260
we'll go from the depth, let's look

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
at that depth for a couple minutes,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.220
because the contrast might help us

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220
to even appreciate more the height

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.820
that we reach by chapter eight.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.380
Of course, chapters nine to 11

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.019
deals with a national question,

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:03.859
after all those doctrinal chapters,

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.220
and chapter 12, I beseech you, brethren,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.019
by the mercies of God, et cetera,

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:10.100
present your bodies a living sacrifice,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.980
deals with all the practical stuff

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.420
built on that doctrine, but it starts

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.059
with the depths of the sin of mankind

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.019
and brings us to what we just read.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.459
We'll come back to that in a minute,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.140
but think about the depths of it.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.540
Romans chapter one, just to pull

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.299
a few of those verses out,

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:32.579
it speaks in verse 18 of all ungodliness

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.500
and the unrighteousness of men.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.820
It tells us in verse 19, they are without excuse.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.540
It tells us in verse 21, they glorified Him not as God,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.739
neither were thankful,

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:46.700
but became vain in their imagination

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.140
and their foolish hearts was darkened.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.619
I would love to read each part in each phrase,

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:54.260
because one builds upon another upon another,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.500
exposing the utter sinfulness of man

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.380
and how far he has fallen.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.820
It says God gave them also,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.899
also gave them up to uncleanness

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:05.500
through the lust of their own hearts.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.220
I'm in verse 24, to dishonor their own bodies

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.380
between themselves.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.619
In verse 25, it tells them they worshiped

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.940
and served the creature more than the Creator.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.540
It tells us in verse 26 that they had vile affections.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.899
It says in verse 28 that God gave them over

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.420
to a reprobate mind.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
And verses 29 to 32 gives one area of sin,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.899
one sin after another after another

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:36.899
in one of the deep sin lists.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.380
That's the condition of the lost.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.619
It's the condition we were all in

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.260
before somebody who was called to convey

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.579
the love of Christ came and conveyed it to us.

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.059
If you're saved tonight,

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.940
just praise God for your salvation.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.420
As you may say, well, a lot of those sins weren't me.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.420
You read through that whole sin list.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.660
And then if you start looking at that and saying,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.339
well, I kind of grew up in a good home

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:05.859
and I was kind of a moral person,

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.019
then go on from chapter one to chapter two

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:09.980
and see thou that judgest.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.899
And continue on until you get to those crescendo

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:13.739
I mentioned.

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:14.899
What's the plural of that musician?

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:15.899
Crescendi?

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.140
Yeah, when you get to them in Romans chapter three

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.739
and look at those things and see,

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:24.059
wow, I stood guilty before God

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.700
in the same category in the depths.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.019
But because of salvation, hallelujah,

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.179
I'm all the way up to the heights.

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.299
Called to convey.

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:37.500
Think of a conveyor belt, will you?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.619
For a few moments as we try to have a word picture.

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:42.700
See, I believe this very much,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.380
that after we got saved,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.619
God left us here for a purpose.

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.579
And a central part of that purpose

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:53.940
is this idea that we're called to convey

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.540
the love of Christ.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.660
I mean, why not once we got saved

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.859
and baptized, instant glory?

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:02.940
Why would we be kept in a sinful body

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.500
on a sinful earth after that we got saved?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.299
We're called to convey the love of Christ.

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:10.899
There will be a day that will come

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:12.380
when the rapture will occur

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.019
and every born-again person

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:15.980
indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.899
will be removed, will be taken,

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.700
will be caught up together

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.220
to meet Him in the air.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.500
And the Holy Spirit will be removed

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.420
for that seven-year tribulation.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.579
And the sinful, fallen condition of man

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.859
in the heart of the unregenerate

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:37.580
with vile affections will have at it.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.979
And the devil will have at it.

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.659
Praise God.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.619
We'll be elsewhere.

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:45.500
Think about what He lifted us from.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.179
And so how can we be recipients

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.739
of that glorious salvation?

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:52.659
How can we sing saved, saved

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:54.739
and not convey it?

00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:57.059
Think of a conveyor belt.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.659
You go to the grocery store

00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:00.020
and you put your groceries on there

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.020
and you put the plastic bar between you

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.299
and the person in front of you

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.979
and maybe there's someone behind you

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:07.739
and it conveys, it moves,

00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:10.179
it transports your goods

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:11.380
from one place to another.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.940
You think of a factory,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.900
an assembly line for Emmy and me,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.460
we would always think of

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.659
a carousel bringing our luggage.

00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:26.419
2017, we came up after many, many hours

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:30.940
in a plane and many hours of layovers

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.299
and none of our luggage was there.

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:37.140
And I don't particularly want to greet

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.659
my family straight out.

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:41.380
After all those hours,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.020
I like to freshen up.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.299
But we had no clothes,

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:47.419
we had no nothing.

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:49.340
We watched that conveyor belt

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.820
conveying everybody else's luggage,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.739
moving it from one place to another

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:55.460
and we had nothing

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.260
and got greeted by our family members.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.659
Jimmy, you're home, you know, New Jersey.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:00.539
I've been waiting.

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:05.539
I'm waiting to talk to you, give me a big hug.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:09.079
When a conveyor belt doesn't convey what it's supposed to,

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:12.099
oh, to think that we would have no Christians here tonight

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:14.619
who would be like that conveyor belt,

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:18.459
not conveying what is needed for the person

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.559
on the other end of it.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.979
We came this time and we got all our luggage, praise God.

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.779
I was so happy, I was so excited.

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:26.219
I ran to get our luggage off,

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:29.539
but I had the pouch right here

00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:31.339
so I can get the two of them and be He-Man.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.219
I don't want my wife, I love her.

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:35.399
I loved her even before the message this morning,

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:37.739
but I got to love her a little bit more after that.

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:39.499
And I had the pouch.

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:41.699
And I went to the conveyor belt to get them

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:42.859
and my pouch went,

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:47.319
and it's a big U-shaped post right next to me

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:50.299
that I kind of hid into as I tried to grab both bags.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:53.019
The passports, the COVID documentation,

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.699
all the things we need to get through there

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:57.099
and not be quarantined or stopped or sent back

00:10:57.099 --> 00:10:59.899
were all of a sudden in a place I couldn't get to them.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:03.339
And this big old boy wasn't gonna get up

00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.699
on that conveyor belt and go with the luggage

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.179
and try to reach in there.

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:09.699
And I was about to say, Emmy, and I thought, no, no, no.

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:12.719
If I do that, I'll be Pastor Man's illustration

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.379
of a husband who doesn't love his wife.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:17.979
And so I got this security person and asked him,

00:11:17.979 --> 00:11:18.859
can you please help me?

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:23.339
That little black and white pouch in there is my life.

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:25.659
And so he got up on there and he went through it once

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:28.339
and had to come around again before he could actually get it

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:29.659
has nothing to do with the sermon,

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:31.459
but I thought I'd just mention that.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.699
I wasn't quite ready to receive those bags.

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:38.459
In fact, I not only lost the pouch,

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:42.319
I didn't get the bags until the next time around,

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:45.699
but that conveyor belt kept conveying the bags

00:11:46.819 --> 00:11:50.579
until I was ready to receive them.

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:54.099
And so I would just say, church, we are called to convey,

00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:55.939
whether that's in the Samoan Islands,

00:11:55.939 --> 00:11:58.259
way out in the middle of the South Pacific.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.219
I like this map of the South Pacific

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:03.399
because it shows Pacific Ocean on both sides.

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:07.459
I could put two marks on that map to show where we are.

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:10.379
But whether the love of Christ is conveyed

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:15.019
all the way out to tiny little islands on Samoa

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:17.799
or right here in your area,

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:21.059
I would say every one of us is called to convey.

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:23.339
And so the idea tonight, the challenge tonight,

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:28.019
the message tonight is let us be superb conveyors

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:29.739
of the love of Christ.

00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:31.619
And I got thinking about that and I said,

00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:35.699
you know, there are three times that particular phrase.

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:38.959
One of my very favorite hymns is the love of God.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.819
That's just, oh, that fourth verse, that poetry of it.

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:44.499
Just such a beautiful hymn.

00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:49.499
But I caught my attention for the first time last month,

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:52.059
love of Christ, and I got looking at it.

00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:54.819
And I found, as I studied the three passages,

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:58.499
I found three different aspects of what

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:02.899
will make a person to become a superb conveyor

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:04.019
of the love of Christ.

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:06.259
And so those are the three we're gonna look at.

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:09.779
The first one, I'll put them in the form of questions

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.099
for us tonight.

00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:15.779
Number one, am I confident in the love of Christ?

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:18.779
See, a person who is confident in the love of Christ

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:21.459
is a superb conveyor of it.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:25.699
When you love something and you're confident in that,

00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:26.879
you will brag about it.

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:29.059
You go to a good restaurant.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:32.179
The Smiths took us to The Lazy Dog

00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:34.379
when they sent me the email when I was up in New Jersey

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.099
and they said, we're gonna go to a restaurant

00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:37.379
called The Lazy Dog.

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:38.219
I thought, hmm.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:43.819
The name doesn't exactly sell it,

00:13:43.819 --> 00:13:44.939
but they said it was good.

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:46.739
And several other people told me it was good.

00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:48.179
And we went there and they told me

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:49.659
what was good on the menu.

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:52.099
And we had a great time and I enjoyed the food.

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:53.819
And they've been there a couple times.

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:56.539
And you know, if you go to a restaurant a few times

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:58.299
and the food's really good,

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:03.299
you'll be confident to talk about it, amen?

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:05.379
You'll be confident to tell someone about it.

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:06.379
I'm not gonna go and say,

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.639
well, I don't know if I'm intellectual enough

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.779
to talk about how great the restaurant is

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.459
or I'm too fat to go up to somebody

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:15.899
and start talking to them about how great the restaurant is.

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:16.819
No, I've gone there.

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:18.299
The waiter was good.

00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:19.699
Or in our case, the waitress.

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:20.979
The food was good to this.

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:22.859
And I've gone there two, three, four times.

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:25.979
And every time they got it right.

00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:27.099
And I'm not worried what you think.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.019
I'm too short.

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:29.219
I'm too tall.

00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:30.059
I'm too.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:35.099
I hope the point is coming through.

00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:36.539
Because many people say,

00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:38.899
I don't feel confident enough to go out throwing

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:41.259
to pass out tracks to talk about the Lord.

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:42.339
I don't have this, I don't have that.

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:43.179
I'm not gifted.

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.659
I'm not this, I'm not that.

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.459
If you're so confident in the love of Christ,

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:49.259
it'll just ooze out of you.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:53.899
A salesman knows that if he's got a junky product,

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.659
it's hard to sell.

00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:58.299
He's gotta lie or cheat or steal or exaggerate

00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:00.419
or try to convince you to need something you don't.

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:02.619
But a salesman who has a great product

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.079
that will change your life, that will really help you,

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:07.579
boy, he can sell that to you all day long.

00:15:08.619 --> 00:15:10.339
How about us?

00:15:10.339 --> 00:15:15.099
Are you that confident in the love of Christ?

00:15:15.099 --> 00:15:17.019
I'm not talking about self-confidence.

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:19.819
You know, when I get up to preach, I preach.

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:21.699
I probably look kinda confident,

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:22.879
but it's not self-confidence.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:23.979
I'm not a confident guy.

00:15:23.979 --> 00:15:25.939
I go around with my shoulders sagging.

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:28.059
I'm worried about what they think about my appearance

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:30.699
and I have this self-consciousness stuff going on

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:33.099
and I over-apologize.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.339
I'm just not one of those people

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:37.539
who carries himself with a lot of self-confidence.

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:42.399
But when I'm up preaching, I'm not preaching gym.

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.139
I'm not trying to convince you about gym.

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:46.939
I'm getting up to preach the word of God

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:49.779
and I have absolute confidence in the word of God.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:52.139
And when I wanna preach to somebody who might be lost,

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:56.419
I have absolute confidence of the love of Christ for them.

00:15:56.419 --> 00:15:58.499
I could get the focus off of gym.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.619
It's funny that I'm saying that while the focus is on him,

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:02.599
but you get my point.

00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:03.479
Look at the passage.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:07.539
Now, come back to the end of Romans chapter eight.

00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:09.699
Come back to the mountain peak with me.

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:12.039
Read it, come back to it often.

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:12.879
Go visit.

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:14.099
You don't have to go look for some mountain

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.139
with a wizard on top.

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:17.859
Go to Romans chapter eight and read that.

00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:22.219
It's a fantastic question with a fantastic answer.

00:16:22.219 --> 00:16:26.379
Who shall separate me from the love of Christ?

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:29.099
I tell you, that'll take care of you.

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:30.899
You've been abused, you've been abandoned,

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:32.619
you've been this, you've been that.

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:34.299
Life has been hard on you.

00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:37.299
You just go to the mountain and say,

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:42.039
none of that stuff separates me from the love of Christ.

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:44.979
He loves me.

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:47.699
His Calvary love is so great.

00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:49.579
He loves me when I'm at my lowest.

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:52.459
He loves me when I am at my weakest.

00:16:52.459 --> 00:16:54.699
He loves me when I messed up, when I failed,

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:56.399
when I stumbled, when I fell,

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.639
when I've denied him three times.

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:06.819
Go tell Peter and the disciples.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.939
And Peter, two beautiful words in the Bible.

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:11.559
I get confident in his love.

00:17:12.739 --> 00:17:13.779
Who shall separate us?

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:15.739
Tribulation, et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:16.939
I don't need to read that.

00:17:16.939 --> 00:17:20.819
But if you just stop at verse 36,

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.699
you're gonna be messed up.

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:24.259
Are you with me tonight, church?

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:25.559
We're back in Romans chapter eight.

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:28.039
I hope we have time to get to the other two passages

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:29.219
because they're fantastic too.

00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:31.819
But this one, who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:34.979
It says in verse 36, as it is written,

00:17:34.979 --> 00:17:38.739
for thy sake we are killed all the day long.

00:17:39.739 --> 00:17:41.899
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

00:17:41.899 --> 00:17:43.939
And there's a period there.

00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:48.499
But I wanna beg of you not to stop at that period

00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:51.599
and keep reading on.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:53.379
Church, let me say this tonight.

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:56.739
Never, ever, ever cast yourself as a victim.

00:17:56.739 --> 00:17:58.139
You are a victor.

00:17:58.139 --> 00:18:00.059
I know the world in which we live in.

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.879
Yes, it's waxing worse and worse.

00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:05.099
Yes, I could gripe all day long about the mainstream media

00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:08.339
and about the politics of this and these things going on

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:09.719
and the freedoms that are stripped.

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:11.259
I can talk to you about the events

00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:13.019
that were commemorated yesterday

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:16.979
that speak of a hatred for this country and attacks on it.

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:18.539
I could speak of current events

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.539
and I could whine all day long.

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:21.379
And you know what?

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:23.399
Too many Christians are doing exactly that.

00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:26.419
Their social media is filled with things

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:28.219
about this person and that person

00:18:28.219 --> 00:18:30.699
and this politics and that politics.

00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:32.019
Where's the love of Christ?

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:35.339
Let's flood, if any of you are on social media,

00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:38.779
flood those things with the love of Christ and stop whining.

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:41.039
It's so hard to be a Christian now in these days.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.059
America used to be a Christian nation,

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:44.079
but now we're going down

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:46.380
and I don't think we could ever have revival.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.440
And all day long, we are accounting a sheep

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.519
for the slaughter, period, full stop, done.

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.079
Please read the next word.

00:18:56.199 --> 00:18:58.959
The first word in the next verse, what does it say?

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:00.019
Nay.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:06.099
No, that is not the perspective on the mountaintop.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:09.500
That is not the perspective when you have come

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.299
and learned of salvation and you've begun to understand

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.779
how it was imputed and how it's imparted

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:17.779
and how it's expressed through you

00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:20.619
and how you have the spirit of God dwelling in you.

00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:22.339
Nay.

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:25.019
And all these things and peril and tribulation

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:27.059
and this and that and attacks.

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.339
We are more than conquerors.

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.179
That kind of love gives me confidence.

00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:34.459
Amen.

00:19:34.459 --> 00:19:36.500
That kind of love gives me confidence

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.219
even when the news reports and the Supreme Court decisions

00:19:40.219 --> 00:19:41.820
and the what and the what and the this

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.059
and the rigged election and the what and whatever.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.859
However your politics are oriented

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:49.539
and all that kind of stuff, nay.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:51.659
And all this, we are more than conquerors.

00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:55.459
Are you that confident in the love of Christ?

00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:58.059
See, that gets your eyes off yourself.

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:00.859
That gets you not worried about confidence in yourself.

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:06.179
self-confidence. Paul said, he doesn't count any of that, he has no confidence in the

00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:14.819
flesh, but his confidence in the love of Christ is great. How about ours? You get

00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:20.379
so confident, I'm going through depression, but he still loves me. I'm

00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:23.979
going through a broken home, I'm going through this situation, I'm going through

00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:29.259
that situation, whatever it may be, but in one thing I can be absolutely confident.

00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:37.779
Nothing, no one shall separate me from the love of Christ. The devil is a liar

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:44.979
from the beginning and he will attack that all day long, but you could stand

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:52.139
firmly wherever you are and say, I am confident in the love of Christ. Nay, in

00:20:52.139 --> 00:20:55.259
all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us, for

00:20:55.259 --> 00:21:02.659
I am persuaded, I have been convinced absolutely, and therefore I have absolute

00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:07.459
confidence that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, etc., nor

00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:13.379
height, nor depth, etc., shall be able to separate us from the love of God. So in

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:18.539
this section it begins with the love of Christ and then it goes down to the love

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:31.259
of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. You cannot be a superb conveyor of the

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:38.099
love of Christ if you're not confident in it. Place your confidence there and it

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:44.819
will just come flowing out. Please do not think this is a sloppy agape message, oh

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:48.099
the love of Christ and I just think about the love of Christ and I'm just

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:52.419
gonna go around all day long and give smiley tracks, just joking pastor, and

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:56.779
just talk about the love of Christ and it's all fluffy and and gooey and agape.

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:02.579
Oh praise God it is sweet and it is wonderful. But the next passage we're

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:07.979
going to look at is in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5. 2nd Corinthians chapter 5, I

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:15.099
want to start up at verse 9 and lead up to verse 14 and even include verse 15. So

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:19.739
number one, am I confident in the love of Christ? If I am, I'm positioned to be a

00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:28.339
superb conveyor. Number two, am I constrained by the love of Christ? Are

00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:32.459
you constrained by the love of Christ? Look at the passage with me,

00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:37.419
wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:42.419
we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive

00:22:42.419 --> 00:22:46.779
the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good

00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:53.499
or bad knowing therefore the terror of the Lord. Let me stop for a second. I'm

00:22:53.499 --> 00:23:01.179
looking at this and I'm seeing in verse 9 labor, work. I'm seeing in verse 10 the

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:07.179
judgment seat of Christ. I'm seeing in verse 11 the terror of the Lord. I'm

00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:12.339
looking at the context that leads up to the Apostle Paul saying to the

00:23:12.339 --> 00:23:20.059
Corinthians, for the love of Christ constraineth us. Well I kind of prefer the

00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:23.699
newer versions because they say compelled and that's easier to understand and I

00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:30.019
think it's a better word. It compels us. No it's not. Constrained is absolutely the

00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:39.939
word. It's the word that means being pressed in on every side. It's the word

00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:44.219
that refers to a ship trying to get through a narrow strait and it must stay

00:23:44.219 --> 00:23:48.459
right in its lane to get through without being harmed. It's the word that means

00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:53.859
armies pressing you on every side. It's the word used for, and this is the word

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:57.819
picture I want to park on for a minute, it's the word used for a cattle or a

00:23:57.939 --> 00:24:04.779
sheep shoot. Have you ever seen one of them where they run all the cattle

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:08.579
through it and it's like these barricades or these fences and there are

00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:12.619
these paths they have to go through. It's time to take the cows to go to graze

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:17.939
because they need to be fed. Flip open that one they go that way. It removes the

00:24:17.939 --> 00:24:22.459
distractions and it provides the direction. The love of Christ

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:31.019
constraineth us. And see if you have a sloppy, non-biblical, theologically weak

00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:34.500
view of the love of Christ, it's just something we receive and it makes us

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.939
feel good and I'm glad I'm saved and going to heaven. Give me the remote. If

00:24:39.939 --> 00:24:45.259
you have a shallow view of the love of Christ, you won't be a superb conveyor of

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.339
it. You may say, oh I'm so confident. I know for sure. I know for a fact. Someone

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:52.979
knocks on my door to ask me, do you know if you died today you'd go to heaven? I

00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:57.619
absolutely know it because I said the prayer and got saved. And that's the

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:03.899
whole depth of the love of Christ. They haven't begun to experience the love of

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:10.359
Christ. The Apostle Paul said, for the love of Christ constraineth us. Does it

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:14.379
constrain you? Well, does the love of Christ remove a whole bunch of

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:18.859
distractions and provide direction? Bring the sheep through. No, send them over

00:25:18.939 --> 00:25:23.939
there to graze. No, send them this way because this is the time to shear their

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:28.259
wool, can be beneficial and helpful to people and clothe people and protect

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:34.219
people. And they've run through that. See, if you have this sloppy type of thing

00:25:34.219 --> 00:25:39.339
and you don't have the experience of the love of Christ constraining you, you're

00:25:39.339 --> 00:25:44.259
not a superb conveyor of it. And so we have the local New Testament Church and

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:48.219
what does the preacher try to do? He's not preaching do this, do this, do this to

00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:51.579
build an empire. The preacher isn't preaching that to make you a good

00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:54.979
little Christian girl and a good little Christian boy and to have all these

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:58.899
rules to follow. And if you do enough of them, you might please God. The love of

00:25:58.899 --> 00:26:04.179
Christ, nothing's going to separate you from it, but it will constrain you. It

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:09.699
will remove you from certain things you used to watch. It will remove you from

00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:14.500
certain things you used to listen to. It will block off certain associations you

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:19.739
used to participate in. It will constrain you. Does the love of Christ have a

00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:26.219
constraining influence in your life? And that's why I went to the verses up above.

00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:32.539
It says, for we labor, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, etc. The

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:39.419
love of Christ constrains us to serve. See, I've been called to convey and I can

00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:44.459
convey the love of Christ because I'm so confident in it, but it takes work.

00:26:44.459 --> 00:26:50.500
Amen? You can't have this mentality, well, I hope they extend the unemployment a

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.339
little bit longer so I could stay home more because I'm making more at home

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:58.619
than if I went to the workplace. That's not a good way to convey. You are not a

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:02.659
superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you're the laziest person in your

00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:06.619
workplace. Well, it's just a government job, you know, you can get away with this

00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:09.539
and that, and I don't want to work too hard and get the others in the office

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:17.859
upset with me. You're not a good conveyor. Your conveyor belt isn't working. Amen?

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:23.339
Christian people ought to be the hardest working people because they're

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:27.939
constrained. So wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we may be

00:27:27.939 --> 00:27:32.299
accepted of him, for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:38.859
Time prevents me from turning to the passage, but you know it. Well, you will

00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:42.939
be judged as a believer. We know unbelievers, different judgment

00:27:42.939 --> 00:27:47.379
altogether, white throne. We don't need to talk about it. But we'll be judged at the

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:51.259
bema seat of Christ for our works, what we've done in the body, whether it's good

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:57.219
or bad, we'll be judged. Is it wood? Hay? Stubble? Etc. That's something that ought

00:27:57.219 --> 00:28:02.659
to grip the mind of a Christian and say, I know that I'm saved, I know I'll never

00:28:02.659 --> 00:28:10.379
be judged for my sin. That judgment was settled for the believer by the love of

00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:18.459
Christ on Calvary. But I will face a judgment for my works, for what I do, for

00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:23.859
how I serve him. And don't make your pastor or someone else beg you to get in

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:28.899
his employ. Say, the love of Christ will constrain me. I don't have to worry about

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:33.419
how confident I am I can do it. I will just be available and I'll get plugged

00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:38.979
in for the cause of Christ, because the love of Christ constrains me to do that.

00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:45.700
And that's something to think about. What will the love of Christ constrain you to

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:54.219
do? And what will it constrain you from doing? I'm not the Holy Spirit. I'm a

00:28:54.219 --> 00:29:02.940
preacher. But the Holy Spirit can point out to you exactly what things he wants

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.859
to constrain you from doing. He may just be wanting to reorganize your time

00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:14.779
management. He may just be saying you don't need to go down the Facebook rabbit

00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:20.539
hole for an hour at a time. He may just be saying you don't need to binge watch

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:25.859
this program because everybody else is. He might be saying to someone you don't

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:32.979
need to be on the video game or the this or the that that much time. You need to

00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:40.459
be plugged in for the cause of Christ, because this world is populated with

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:46.899
people who need the love of Christ. What will he constrain you from doing that is

00:29:46.899 --> 00:29:52.739
filling your time? I remember Edgar says in Proverbs chapter 30, remove far from

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:59.179
me vanity and lies. Oh Lord remove far from me empty empty things that have no

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:02.619
impact on eternity.

00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:10.619
Remove those far from me, the idea of let me fill my time with things that are useful for the cause of Christ.

00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:14.619
Are you a superb conveyor of the love of Christ?

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:19.739
We'll go to our third point.

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:23.739
Do I comprehend the love of Christ?

00:30:23.939 --> 00:30:27.419
Would you turn to this beautiful reading in Ephesians chapter three with me?

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:39.419
Ephesians chapter three, verse 14 to 19, our last passage, our third time, going in order of appearance in the word of God of the love of Christ.

00:30:39.619 --> 00:30:44.619
One of the beautiful times where the Apostle Paul prays for one of the churches.

00:30:44.819 --> 00:30:47.219
Here he says, starting in verse 14,

00:30:47.419 --> 00:30:51.419
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:30:52.219 --> 00:30:59.219
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory.

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:03.219
Oh my church, how I want to park there and ponder that.

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:06.219
Time doesn't allow but come back to that.

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:10.219
The riches of his grace, the riches of his glory, the riches of his mercy.

00:31:10.419 --> 00:31:14.219
Oh, those are wonderful thoughts to ponder.

00:31:14.419 --> 00:31:20.219
But he said that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man.

00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:28.019
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:37.019
may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height.

00:31:37.219 --> 00:31:41.019
I would recommend that you underline all four of those dimensions.

00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:49.019
And say, do I comprehend the love of Christ?

00:31:49.019 --> 00:31:53.819
See, you will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you are absolutely confident in it,

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:56.819
that nothing can separate you from it.

00:31:57.019 --> 00:32:03.819
You will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ if you allow the Spirit of God to give you direction,

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:07.819
constrain you from going in certain directions and doing certain things,

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:09.819
and directing you in certain paths.

00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:15.819
And you will be a superb conveyor of the love of Christ as you increase in your comprehension.

00:32:15.819 --> 00:32:19.619
My wife can teach a rock to read.

00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:24.619
She's incredible at what she does with those kids, and she's teaching them to read in English,

00:32:24.819 --> 00:32:28.619
but she knows that she could teach them from a very young age to be little automatons,

00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:32.619
to be little robots just reading, and it could sound good.

00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:35.619
Jane and Spot went to... whatever.

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:41.619
And they could just say it, but she knows questions, questions, questions, comprehension questions,

00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:43.619
because they could read it and not know what they said.

00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:46.419
Bob threw Jane the ball.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:48.419
What did Bob do?

00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:51.419
Bob went home.

00:32:51.619 --> 00:32:54.419
They could answer something that has nothing to do with what they read,

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:56.419
because they don't have comprehension.

00:32:56.619 --> 00:32:59.419
And she works on them, and she works on them, and she works on them,

00:32:59.619 --> 00:33:02.419
so that they're not only reading, but they're comprehending,

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:06.419
so that by the time they even get to first grade, they can read those simple sentences

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:09.419
and understand what they're reading and build on that.

00:33:09.619 --> 00:33:12.419
And she's done incredible work with it.

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:14.220
I remember back when I was an English teacher,

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:18.220
I was teaching the pre-college class in American Samoa,

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:23.220
and I knew that these students, if they came to the United States to university,

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:26.220
they wouldn't be ready, and so I started having them read things

00:33:26.419 --> 00:33:28.220
that would be a real challenge for them,

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:31.220
and we had deer time, drop everything and read.

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:34.220
And I started giving them Dickens and stuff that was above,

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:36.220
and they had to have a dictionary, and they would read,

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:38.220
and then afterwards we would talk about it,

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:40.220
and they would moan, groan, gripe, and complain.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.019
Oh, Mr. Jim, I don't understand what I'm reading.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.019
I can't get this.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.019
Just read it.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.019
If you don't know a word, get the dictionary out.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.019
We'll talk about it afterwards.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.019
This is deer time.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.019
No talking.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.019
And I did that day after day, and the tension kind of built,

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.019
and built in one wonderful day.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.019
Pai, sitting in that corner of the classroom,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.019
it was silent as anything, and she said,

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.019
Mr. Jim, Mr. Jim, I read the whole page,

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.019
and I understood the whole thing.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.019
That's a teacher moment.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.019
I want to say to you tonight,

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.019
I might steal a couple extra minutes,

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.019
because we have to scratch the surface on this.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.019
We need Christians in the pews,

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.019
on the streets, in the community,

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.019
who have a high level of comprehension.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.019
We don't need just first grade level of comprehension,

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.019
even third or fifth grade.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.019
We need to be high school.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.019
We need to be college.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.019
We need to be post graduates.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:44.820
We need people who are PhDs in the love of Christ,

00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:47.820
where your understanding is increasing.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.820
We will never fully comprehend this side of heaven,

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:55.820
the height, the depth, the breadth,

00:34:56.019 --> 00:34:59.820
the length of the love of Christ.

00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:02.820
But we could keep going up.

00:35:03.019 --> 00:35:05.820
And the more you comprehend it,

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:08.619
oh, the more you'll share it.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.619
You'll just long for people.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.619
Even if we don't take the kindergartner

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.619
and expect them to be reading on university level,

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.619
we're fine with Bob.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.619
Bob is big.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.619
And somehow they have a hard time with the Bs and Ps,

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.619
so they mess that up.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.619
Pop is pig.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.619
And we have to teach him the B and the P sound.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.619
You get some funny things that come out.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.619
I remember the radio announcer back then,

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.619
it was some years ago,

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:35.419
but he would always say,

00:35:35.619 --> 00:35:37.419
President Push.

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:40.419
I said, what was President Push we heard about day after day?

00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:42.419
It was the Bs and Ps.

00:35:42.619 --> 00:35:44.419
But you don't go to the kindergartner

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:48.419
and expect them to have law degrees or medical degrees

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:50.419
and be able to read things at that level.

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:53.419
Oh, but you want them to be able to start reading

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:57.419
and add to it more and more.

00:35:57.619 --> 00:36:00.419
If you really want to begin just a little bit

00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:03.419
to understand these four dimensions,

00:36:03.419 --> 00:36:08.220
go back to Ephesians chapter 2

00:36:08.419 --> 00:36:14.220
and start looking.

00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.220
There are four dimensions given.

00:36:16.419 --> 00:36:19.220
I'm not going to do them in the order that they say in that verse.

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:21.220
They say breadth, length, depth, and height.

00:36:21.419 --> 00:36:23.220
Let's start with the depth.

00:36:23.419 --> 00:36:26.220
This will be very easy because we already read Romans chapter 1

00:36:26.419 --> 00:36:28.220
and pulled out all those things.

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.220
But look in Ephesians chapter 2.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.019
And you hath he quickened made alive

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.019
who were dead in trespasses and sin,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.019
wherein in time past

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.019
ye walked according to the course of this world.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.019
See, all three enemies.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.019
There's the world.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.019
According to the prince and the power of the air.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.019
There's the devil.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.019
And the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.019
among whom also we had all our conversation

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.019
in time past in the lust of our flesh.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.019
Oh, look at those three enemies.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.019
Look at the hopeless soul

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.820
who's dead, dead in their trespasses and sins.

00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:05.820
The Calvinists like to take this passage and distort it

00:37:06.019 --> 00:37:09.820
and say that the person has no involvement whatsoever

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:12.820
in responding, so the implication is

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:15.820
why go out and give a track and try to lead them to the Lord.

00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:18.820
No, they're dead like Adam and Eve were dead when they were cast away.

00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:20.820
They were dead in their spirit.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:22.820
And when you're dead in your spirit,

00:37:23.019 --> 00:37:25.820
the three enemies, the internal, the external, the infernal enemy

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:27.820
have their way with you

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:29.820
and keep you apart from God

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:33.820
and you're in the depth and you're helpless.

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:35.820
Oh, but that there would be people who would come

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:37.820
and convey the love of Christ

00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:40.820
and that the Holy Spirit can work from the outside

00:37:41.019 --> 00:37:42.820
and you could be quickened and made alive again.

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:44.820
I want you to think, Christian,

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:47.820
just for a few moments tonight about these dimensions.

00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:50.820
Think about how deep he reached.

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.820
Think of the depths of his love.

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:55.820
He who was seated in the heavenly places.

00:37:56.019 --> 00:37:56.820
He in the Godhead.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.619
He who is complete said,

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.619
I'll go to a sin-cursed earth.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.619
I'll walk those dusty roads.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.619
I'll walk among those men who are sinful

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.619
and receive everything they throw at me.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.619
A wine-bibber and a drunkard

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.619
and the piercing and the crucifixion.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.619
The lies, the false witness.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.619
I'll go among them.

00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:28.419
You will begin to comprehend the love of Christ

00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:32.419
when you start to think of how deep he reached

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:35.419
to pull you up.

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:37.419
I can only scratch the surface.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:39.419
My time is really up in one minute,

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:41.419
but I'm going to steal five more.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.419
Amen.

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:45.419
Oh, he reached deep.

00:38:45.619 --> 00:38:46.419
Now think about the heights.

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:47.419
Just keep reading.

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:50.419
I can't not read verse 4.

00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:51.419
My goodness.

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:53.419
But God, hallelujah,

00:38:53.419 --> 00:38:55.219
is rich in mercy for his great love

00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:57.219
with where he loved us.

00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:59.219
Even when we were dead in sins,

00:38:59.419 --> 00:39:01.219
hath quickened us together with Christ.

00:39:01.419 --> 00:39:03.219
For by grace are you saved.

00:39:03.419 --> 00:39:07.219
Now see the height in verse 6.

00:39:07.419 --> 00:39:10.219
And hath raised us up together

00:39:10.419 --> 00:39:14.219
and made us to sit together in heavenly places.

00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:17.219
That moment that he reached down

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:21.219
and you who were dead in trespasses and sins,

00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:22.219
he quickened.

00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:26.020
He lifted you as high as you can go.

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:27.020
Amen.

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:30.020
He brought you to be seated in heavenly places.

00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:31.020
If you want to ponder that,

00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:33.020
go to Isaiah chapter 6

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:35.020
and look at the throne.

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:36.020
Look at them saying,

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:38.020
Holy, holy, holy.

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:41.020
And see how high that is and say,

00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:43.020
I'm seated there already

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:45.020
in my position.

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:46.020
Hallelujah.

00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:47.020
Go to Revelation chapter 1

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.020
and see Christ revealed in his glory.

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.020
Not in his robe.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.820
Not in his dusty sandals

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.820
that they have to clean his feet.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.820
But see him in Revelation chapter 1

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.820
and then go to Revelation chapter 4

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.820
and chapter 5

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.820
and see that glorious,

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:02.820
exalted,

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.340
Seen and realized the love of Christ

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.620
has such height that He brought me up to that.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.740
I was meant to go to the deepest, farthest place

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.220
separated eternally from God.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.980
Oh, but Christian who is saved,

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.700
who shall separate us from the love of God?

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.860
You start to grow in your comprehension

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.620
of the depth of His love

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.380
and how low it reached

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.020
and how high it brought you.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.420
Oh, and now think of the length of it.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.340
Look still in verse 6, now into verse 7,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.580
that in the ages to come,

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.780
He might show the exceeding riches of His grace

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:48.180
and His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.180
Oh, the love of Christ is long.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.500
I've had people stand before an altar

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.020
and say, I do,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.780
as I married them, but they didn't.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.860
It lasted a while, but they didn't.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.660
I've had in my own life experience

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.660
a biological mother who just left,

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.540
tore me up as a child.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.220
That's the one who's supposed to love you

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.660
all the way through.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.900
That's not a self-pity party.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.780
That's the love of Christ.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.100
Amen.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.700
But there is love in this world,

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.540
even love that we might think

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.220
ought to be most reflective of that love,

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.900
but it's not.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.860
You could have a friend that you've poured yourself into

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.140
in friendship and loving devotion

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.660
to this person as a friend,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.860
and then something happens

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.740
and the relationship is broken,

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.220
never to be repaired.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.580
Not so with the love of Christ.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.620
It's long that in the ages to come,

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.180
that throughout eternity,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.100
He's lifted you so high,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.380
and that love of Christ lasts forever.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.060
We shall forever in heaven

00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.140
be the envy of angels

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.380
because of our redemption

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.340
and our exalted position.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.540
Have we made it to sixth grade yet?

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.940
Can we get our comprehension level?

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.020
Maybe let's get up to high school.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.020
And how about the breadth?

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.100
See, I really, really appreciate this church.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.700
I'm not just buttering anybody up.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.020
I really appreciate what this church has done for me

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.180
over the last few years

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.020
that we've been partnering together.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.700
The faithful support, the prayers,

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.780
the encouragement, the huge gifts,

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.700
the belief in what God is doing

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.980
through such people as us.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.140
I really appreciate Jennifer coming out

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.540
on the missions trip

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.420
and seeing our work firsthand

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.260
and being there.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.300
And the truth is,

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.220
I would like to take you as a church

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.660
and hug you.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.660
I'd like to embrace you.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.020
I'd like to reach around all of you.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.020
And some of you are like, uh-uh.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.300
And then we see how sweaty you are right now too.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.740
That's a double uh-uh.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.060
I thought I heard Scooby.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.820
That's what I thought I heard.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.900
But church, I don't have that embrace.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.300
But you keep reading in Ephesians 2,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.220
and that wall of partition was removed.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.900
And His embrace reached to the worst.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.780
Even with vile affections

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.820
that burned in their lust

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.780
one toward another,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.340
working that which is inseemly.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.340
His embrace reached every single one of them.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.100
Those who worship the creature

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.380
more than the Creator.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.100
If they just but turned

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.700
and received His love.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.220
Oh, what a reach.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.260
To the uttermost parts of the earth.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.580
And then He went to the other side.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.020
And He took the Hebrew.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.580
He took the one who they thought

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.700
they were just in the pocket of the divine,

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.820
judging everyone else,

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.180
but they were lost too.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.740
And He said in those verses,

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.740
it's the same thing,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.580
that if thou shalt confess

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.580
with thy mouth and believe

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.540
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.740
For whosoever,

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.180
whosoever,

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.780
what an embrace.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.260
His arms, the breadth,

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.060
we would say width,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.140
of His love is so great.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.860
What if we said right here tonight,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.900
oh Lord,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.460
I will grab onto the love of Christ

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.540
with such confidence

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.580
that it cannot be shaken.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.860
And when I doubt myself

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.380
and I doubt my circumstances

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.020
and I doubt this and I doubt that,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.860
I will not doubt the love of Christ.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.140
I will go to the mountaintop

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.540
of Romans chapter eight.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.179
What if we said tonight,

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.300
Pastor in just a second,

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.339
I'm gonna just ask you to come

00:44:23.339 --> 00:44:25.540
and take the whole invitation.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.779
What if tonight,

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.779
the Holy Spirit spoke to you

00:44:29.779 --> 00:44:31.420
and someone would say,

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.980
oh, Holy Spirit of God,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.059
constrain me from this

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:39.460
or to do that.

00:44:40.339 --> 00:44:43.660
We need missionaries in the Samoan islands,

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.619
but there are just not enough people

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:47.420
who are so constrained

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.980
by the Spirit of God,

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.980
by the love of Christ to go.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.860
I'm convinced of that.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.899
I'm not saying it's one of you,

00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:54.740
could be.

00:44:55.899 --> 00:44:58.100
What if you would say tonight,

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:58.940
oh Father,

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.779
oh Spirit of God,

00:45:00.779 --> 00:45:04.460
increase my comprehension

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.580
for all the education.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.339
Some of you may have an education

00:45:07.339 --> 00:45:09.619
in advanced degrees and professions

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:11.779
and you may be very knowledgeable

00:45:11.779 --> 00:45:13.980
in law and medicine and engineering

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.220
and this or that.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.179
But you would say,

00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:20.619
the most important degree I want

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:23.580
is a full comprehension

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.820
to the measure I can

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.460
this side of heaven,

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.980
of the love of Christ

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.580
so that I can be a superb conveyor.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.660
Father, we thank you, Lord,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.660
for your word.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.820
We thank you that you would even allow us

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.300
to be vessels to convey your love.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.140
And I pray, Father,

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.420
that you would do that work

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.380
that only you can do.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.300
In Jesus' name, amen.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.619
Amen, would you stand with me?

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:49.140
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.660
We're gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.100
What a great challenge

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.460
from the word of God.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.460
I'm so thankful for the love of Christ.
