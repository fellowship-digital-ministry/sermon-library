1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,039
when we think about Memorial Day,

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:04,639
we find that throughout the Word of God,

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,680
we have been given the truth

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,039
in how the Lord had instructed his people

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,000
on a number of occasions to set up memorials.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,719
There are several that we could look at,

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,959
we could speak of.

8
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,239
Of course, as we've studied through the book of Joshua

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,680
together over the last seven weeks,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,120
we've had the opportunity to read about the memorials there

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
to commemorate the crossing of the Red Sea,

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,040
one that was in the midst of the,

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,479
excuse me, the Jordan River,

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,400
one that was in the midst of the Jordan River,

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,759
one that was in Gilgal,

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,639
the place in which they encamped that first night

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,840
as they entered into the land of promise.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,799
We could look at victories that were experienced

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,360
by the children of Israel

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,840
and how that when Joshua fought against Amalek

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,479
and Moses, remember, as he held up his hands,

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,560
they were victorious.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,959
And as his hands fell, the battle went the other way

24
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:59,040
and Aaron and Hur helped hold up his hands

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,479
and God tells them to write these things in a book

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,360
for a memorial to remember.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,720
Even as we looked at the end of chapter eight,

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,680
as I mentioned in the beginning of our service today,

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,720
there are some things that they're remembering,

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
commemorating.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,919
I think about the Passover.

32
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,360
It's interesting if you were to read the book of Exodus

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,839
and look at the instruction that's given

34
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,480
with regard to the Passover for the children of Israel,

35
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,680
they were given the command to observe the Passover.

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,599
Of course, the 10th plague is they would be delivered

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,639
from Egyptian bondage and we see the death of the firstborn

38
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,639
and all those things that take place.

39
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,839
But it's interesting to note

40
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:39,959
how that God had given specific direction

41
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,639
with regard to the Passover.

42
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:45,440
Yes, indeed, it would point to Christ, our Passover,

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,800
even as Paul says to the believers in Corinth,

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,199
and we're so grateful for the typology

45
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,199
and the picture of the Passover in the Old Testament,

46
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,639
but they were to observe it annually

47
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,279
and they were due it for a purpose,

48
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:01,360
for a memorial for the generations to come.

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,239
You know, it's a sad thing

50
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,239
when you read throughout the history of Israel

51
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,959
and you read the pages of the Old Testament,

52
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,520
you find that for long periods of time,

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,960
the Passover was not properly observed.

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,360
And you wonder why it was that they served false gods,

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,039
why it was that they got caught up

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,600
in all of the sin that they got caught up in

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,919
and why it was that the judgment of God came upon them.

58
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,880
God had put some things in place for them

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,360
to be mindful, to remember His strong hand of deliverance

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
and what He did for them.

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,000
And when they failed to observe those things,

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,520
you find that they are in a position

63
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
where Jeremiah would say that they had forgot.

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
God, of course, is speaking.

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,160
Jeremiah records where the Lord says,

66
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,440
my people have forgotten me days without number.

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,759
What a sad claim.

68
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,839
This morning, I want to preach a message

69
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,119
that I've simply entitled, Remember.

70
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,720
And if you look in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm gonna take a portion of this passage of scripture

72
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,759
and deal with a few things this morning

73
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,720
that I hope will be a blessing to you.

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
In the midst of chaos and confusion,

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,800
I believe it is important for us to be reminded

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,479
of some biblical truth,

77
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,520
some powerful, life-transforming biblical truth.

78
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,479
There are times in which we see

79
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,759
in the midst of chaos and confusion,

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,279
in the midst of a world

81
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:26,000
that seems to have lost its collective mind,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there are times in which we need to be reminded

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,039
of some biblical truth because we can forget.

84
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,520
We are prone to wander, as the songwriter said,

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,039
but we also understand that as human beings,

86
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,759
we sometimes are guilty of forgetting things.

87
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,520
Sometimes we forget things that are important.

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,240
It's one thing if you forget something at the grocery store

89
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,960
that probably isn't going to be a major issue,

90
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
but there are times in which we forget

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,000
some very important things.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,039
And look at what the Lord says.

93
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,839
Of course, Moses is giving instruction

94
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,399
to the children of Israel as they would prepare

95
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,199
to enter into the land of promise.

96
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,960
In Deuteronomy chapter number six and verse number 10,

97
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
the Bible says this,

98
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,679
and it shall be when the Lord thy God

99
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,399
shall have brought thee into the land

100
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,440
which he sware unto thy fathers,

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,279
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,

102
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,399
to give thee great and goodly cities

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,359
which thou buildest not,

104
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,799
and houses full of all good things

105
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,079
which thou fillest not,

106
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,839
and wells digged which thou diggest not,

107
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,720
vineyards and olive trees which thou plantest not,

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,399
when thou shalt have eaten and be full.

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,880
Now, if you read verses 10 and 11,

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,640
you see that they're enjoying

111
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,959
times of blessing and prosperity.

112
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,880
God has faithfully brought them into the land

113
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,160
that he promised to give them.

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,799
They are now in a place where they're living in houses

115
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,000
that they did not build.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,480
They're being, of course, sustained from wells

117
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,359
and vineyards that they dig not,

118
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,720
neither did they plant,

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,359
and we find that there is a warning

120
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,600
that is given in verse number 12.

121
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,440
The Bible says,

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,399
then beware lest thou forget the Lord

123
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,760
which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt

124
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,559
from the house of bondage.

125
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,320
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and serve him

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,519
and shalt swear by his name.

127
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,920
It's interesting that this warning is given

128
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,959
in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

129
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,119
and you read throughout the book of Deuteronomy

130
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,959
as God is preparing his people for entrance into the land,

131
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,279
and we find that God gave them this warning

132
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,880
of beware lest thou forget the Lord,

133
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,559
but then he also gave them instruction

134
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,679
on some things to do

135
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,799
to help them prevent forgetting.

136
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,160
Set up these memorials.

137
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,679
Have these things in place.

138
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,519
Why?

139
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,200
So that you'll always be mindful of what I've done for you.

140
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,559
As we think about the truth here in the Old Testament

141
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,399
for the children of Israel,

142
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,079
I want you to look over the book of 2 Peter,

143
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,440
and I want you to consider what Peter says

144
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
to those that he's writing to here

145
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,079
in 2 Peter chapter number one,

146
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,079
and we find that Peter has written these two epistles.

147
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,559
He was a man that was a disciple

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
that we can learn much from.

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
We find that just a character, I believe,

150
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,679
in the word of God that we can very much relate to,

151
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,399
and we find that as he's writing this second epistle,

152
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,239
similar to Paul writing 2 Timothy,

153
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:31,119
Peter was keenly aware of the fact that he would soon die,

154
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,079
and he uses this phraseology

155
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,880
that I must put off this my tabernacle,

156
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,519
and speaking about his death that would soon come.

157
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,160
We know that Paul understood that

158
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
as he writes to Timothy in 2 Timothy.

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
In fact, in chapter number four,

160
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,720
he speaks about the time of his departure was at hand,

161
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
and so on and so forth,

162
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,920
and so Peter is writing this epistle

163
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,119
understanding that he would soon be leaving the earth.

164
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,440
He would put off this, his earthly tabernacle,

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,880
and I want you to notice what Peter says

166
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,119
in 2 Peter one in verse number 12.

167
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,920
He says, wherefore, I will not be negligent

168
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,359
to put you always in remembrance of these things.

169
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,640
Now notice this phrase, though you know them

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
and be established in the present truth.

171
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,200
Yea, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle

172
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,119
to stir you up by putting you in remembrance,

173
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,880
knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,

174
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,279
even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.

175
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,920
Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,480
after my decease to have these things

177
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,640
always in remembrance.

178
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,959
If you notice in just these few verses of Scripture,

179
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,000
we find that Peter says in verse number 12

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,799
that I will put you always in remembrance of these things.

181
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,700
He tells them, I understand that you know them.

182
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,040
It's not that I'm giving you new truth,

183
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,119
it's that I'm reminding you of some things

184
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,239
that are important.

185
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,359
He says in verse number 13, putting you in remembrance.

186
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,519
He says in verse number 15

187
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,279
that these things always in remembrance.

188
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,279
Notice what he says in verse 15.

189
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,920
Moreover, I will endeavor that ye,

190
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,619
the people that he's ministering to,

191
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,519
the people that he's delivering this message to,

192
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,480
the people, the recipients of these reminders,

193
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,239
he's saying that I will endeavor that ye may be able

194
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:34,000
after my decease, after I put off this,

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,880
my earthly tabernacle, after I go to be with the Lord,

196
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,760
that through the teaching, through the instruction,

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,159
through the remembrance of these things,

198
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,320
that after my decease,

199
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,239
to have these things always in remembrance.

200
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:52,239
See, I believe that Peter had this just goal, if you will,

201
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,520
that the people that he had been called to minister to

202
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
would continue,

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,479
that they would continue to serve the Lord faithfully.

204
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,719
Remember, the people that Peter is ministering to

205
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,960
in 1 and 2 Peter are people

206
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,200
that are dealing with great hardship,

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,719
people that are living under the Emperor Nero

208
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,359
and all of the persecution

209
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,559
and all of the difficulties that they're dealing with.

210
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,479
And we find that there are people,

211
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,200
if you look at the first epistle,

212
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
that are in need of encouragement,

213
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,840
a people that are in need of instruction.

214
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,479
And Peter says, I'm gonna stir you up

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,520
by putting you in remembrance of these things.

216
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,640
In that vein, I wanna share just four things

217
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,520
with you this morning that you know,

218
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,479
but I wanna remind you of.

219
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,559
Remember, see, in the midst of chaos and confusion,

220
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,400
when things seem to be on their head, so to speak,

221
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,039
and it seems like it's challenging

222
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,400
for us to navigate the waters,

223
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,960
it is good for us to be reminded of some things.

224
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,479
Now, I will readily admit to you

225
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:58,000
that this morning this list could have been 50, 60, 70 things

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,919
and we could have part one, part two, part.

227
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,919
but the reality is I picked four things if you have others the Lord bless you and

228
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,079
You can share them with me

229
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,719
I'd be welcome to receive them

230
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:16,479
But I simply picked four things that I want to remind you of this morning that I hope that we would be

231
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,719
Even as God said to the children of Israel in the book of Deuteronomy beware lest you forget

232
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:27,939
See there are times in which we must be reminded Peter says I want to remind you

233
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:33,979
I'm gonna put you in remembrance of these things number one. The Lord is still on his throne

234
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,139
The Lord is still on his throne. He is what wonderful songs that were sung today

235
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:47,739
What a wonderful special during our offertory to think about the the place and position of our God

236
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:49,619
He is

237
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,899
Almighty he is the Lord God

238
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,279
Omnipotent he reigns

239
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:59,279
He's always been on his throne. No one will ever take him from his throne

240
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,279
He's not gonna vacate his throne

241
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,679
We can rejoice in this truth this morning, and I believe that it's important for us to remember

242
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,399
That God's on his throne

243
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,919
Listen the the powers that be on this world

244
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:19,879
Are in subject to the power of God we must be mindful of that

245
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,639
The reality is that he is the Lord God Almighty notice it turned back to the book of Psalms if you will

246
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,759
We're gonna look at a number of passages of Scripture today

247
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,039
And I hope that they'd be a blessing to you as you look at what's taking place and consider the fact and remember

248
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,639
Today that the Lord is still on his throne. Sometimes we deal with

249
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,879
Difficulties and opposition and it seems as if the enemy might be making progress

250
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,879
It seems as if maybe they're winning but we must be mindful of the truth that God is on his throne

251
00:11:53,039 --> 00:12:00,059
Psalm 11 verse 3 and 4 the Bible says this if the foundations be destroyed. What can the righteous do?

252
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,279
But notice what he says in verse number 4 the Lord is in

253
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:13,159
His holy temple the Lord's throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try

254
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,699
The children of men he's on his throne psalm 45 in verse number 6

255
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,599
Notice the psalmist says here thy throne. Oh God is forever and ever

256
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,419
The scepter of thy kingdom is a right

257
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:34,399
Scepter thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness

258
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,479
Therefore God by God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows

259
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,679
Notice that his throne is forever and ever psalm 47 in verse number 8

260
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,119
The Bible says there the psalmist is declaring God reigneth over the heathen

261
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,079
God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness

262
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:00,839
We're mindful of the account that God gives us in the life of Isaiah as it's recorded for us in Isaiah chapter number 6

263
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,839
And you'll understand that it's in that time in which the King King Uzziah died

264
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,999
In fact Isaiah 6 begins by telling us that in the year that King Uzziah died

265
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:14,079
But I want you to notice the vision of Isaiah

266
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,759
We understand and we're not dealing with the entirety of the passage here in Isaiah 6

267
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,019
We understand the impact that this vision had upon Isaiah

268
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,119
We understand his call and his response and what have you but I want you to notice in verse number 1 of Isaiah 6

269
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,239
The Bible says in the year that King Uzziah died

270
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:38,759
I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple

271
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,479
Above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain

272
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:45,679
He covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain

273
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,359
He did fly and one cried unto another and said holy

274
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:55,959
Holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory

275
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,999
What Isaiah say he saw the Lord in his proper proper place

276
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:06,299
He saw that the Lord was sitting upon his throne. The Lord sitteth upon a throne high and lifted up

277
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:14,719
I'm thankful that our God is still on the throne these thousands of years later after the life of Isaiah after the death of Uzziah

278
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:22,319
That's recorded here. We find that God is still upon his throne in Hebrews 1. We've studied the passage of Scripture. Of course, we're

279
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,999
Making progress to the book of Hebrews. We've taken a couple of weeks off here of recent

280
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,439
but we will get back to the book of Hebrews but in chapter number 1 and verse number 8 the Bible tells us that the

281
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:40,319
Lord says notice here what God says to the Son to the Lord Jesus Christ, but unto the Son he said thy throne

282
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:47,439
Oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom and we understand

283
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,519
Even as we've looked at some of those psalms that we looked at just a moment ago

284
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,279
In the fulfillment of those we find that the Bible

285
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,899
Tells us that our God is in control of all things in 1st Peter 3 in verse number 22

286
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,439
It says who has gone into heaven is on the right hand of God

287
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,479
angels and

288
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,479
authorities and powers

289
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,119
being made subject unto him

290
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,039
in

291
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,279
Recent days Holly and Juliana have read through the book of Job and we've had conversation and discussion

292
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,519
about some of that which Job had experienced during his earthly trial, but one of the

293
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,199
Just precious reminders as you read the book of Job is to understand there

294
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,519
That anything that happened to Job had to be approved by God

295
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,079
the devil

296
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,879
The enemy of God's people the accuser of the brethren. Oh, he has power for sure. His power is limited

297
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,759
We serve the Lord God Almighty and he is sitting upon his throne

298
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,199
Think of the passage of Scripture in the book of Revelation that gives us a wonderful

299
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,279
Vision and insight into what John sees in Revelation chapter number four

300
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,519
I believe very specifically that as you study Revelation chapters 1 through 4 you have the opportunity to see

301
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,439
The the letters that are sent to the seven churches in Asia

302
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:18,719
And how that the Lord is giving those letters and then you come into chapter number four and verse number one and

303
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,759
The Bible says this after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as

304
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,479
It were of a trumpet talking with me

305
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:33,239
Which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter

306
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,519
What a great picture of the rapture of the church at the end of the church age

307
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,359
And of course, we don't know how long that's gonna be we do know that he's coming and we'll deal with that in just a

308
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:43,959
moment

309
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,359
But we find here that the Bible then gives us in Revelation 4 verses 8 through 11

310
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:53,679
Notice these words and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him

311
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:57,959
They were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy

312
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,439
holy holy

313
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,439
Lord God Almighty

314
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,959
Which was and is and is to come he's holy he's omnipotent

315
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,839
He's eternal

316
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,999
The Bible says in verse 9 and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne

317
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,079
Who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty?

318
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,759
elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and

319
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,239
Cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art

320
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:34,319
Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power

321
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,719
For thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure. They are and were

322
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,119
created

323
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,119
In the midst of chaos and confusion

324
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,159
One thing that we must remember is that the Lord is still on his throne

325
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:53,039
Can I tell you number two the Lord is still building his church?

326
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:59,839
He said but the church hasn't been able to assemble I understand but it's God's Church our church

327
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:07,519
and we must understand that even in the time in which we've not been able to assemble that God is still able to work and

328
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:14,359
God is still bringing forth his purpose in his plan. Does it mean that we're not interested in meeting? Absolutely not

329
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,999
I mean I long for the day. I'm looking forward with great

330
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,359
anticipation of next week and even as I've thought and

331
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,239
Considered in recent hours

332
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,679
just the the thought of next Sunday morning being able to see the brethren and worship together the

333
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:34,399
Emotions that many of us will experience in that moment

334
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,359
But we must remember that the Lord is building his church. It's his church

335
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,760
He's the head of it and for that we rejoice

336
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,899
He has promised us that he will build his church. He didn't say I'll build my church and here are the

337
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:57,479
Points of criteria that must be met in order for me to do my work. No, he's building his church and

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,159
We can rejoice in that and we find here that the Bible tells us notice in Matthew chapter number 16

339
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,719
As I give you a moment to turn there

340
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:13,959
I want you to consider with me that as the Lord builds his church that we must understand that he builds his church

341
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,679
According to his plan and he builds it in his time. Oh

342
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,679
There are many

343
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
over the years that have had

344
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:32,200
various meeting seminars and what whatever you want to call them on church growth or church

345
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,639
building ideas and

346
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,519
Certainly God uses people and certainly he's gifted people to be able to do the work of the ministry

347
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,519
But we must never

348
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,219
Think that it's the people that build the church

349
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,799
It's the Lord that builds the church. I'm thankful that he uses people

350
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,399
But it's God that does the work

351
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,760
The Bible tells us in Matthew 16. What a powerful passage of Scripture where the Lord Jesus

352
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Jesus says to His disciples, whom do men say that I am?

353
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,820
Notice in verse 13, when Jesus came into the coast of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples

354
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,740
saying, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

355
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,540
And they said, some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah

356
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,620
or one of the prophets.

357
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,900
He saith unto them, notice, but whom say ye that I am?

358
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:35,920
And Peter answered and said, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

359
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood

360
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,680
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

361
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,400
And I say also unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock, notice what Jesus said,

362
00:20:49,400 --> 00:21:00,060
I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

363
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,620
We find that throughout the history of the church age, you can start reading in the book

364
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,780
of Acts, and you can read church history that's in divine scripture, that's recorded in part

365
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,320
of the complete canon of scripture.

366
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,840
You can read the church history that God has given us in His Word.

367
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,860
You can read church history that's been recorded throughout the centuries, and you can find

368
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,220
there's always been opposition.

369
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,220
The enemy hates, I mean, Satan and the enemy, they hate the church.

370
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,180
But we find that God has always built His church, and we look and we follow, this morning

371
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,320
I was thanking the Lord for those that have faithfully gone on before us, those that were

372
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,100
willing to pay whatever sacrifice was necessary to spend time in prison, and to be burned

373
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
at the stake.

374
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:54,060
I mean, we've read, even last night, if you're reading the devotional book that we distributed

375
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,120
this year for 2020, you read about one that gave his life, he was a martyr, for the furtherance

376
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,260
of the gospel, for the truth of God's Word.

377
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:12,340
And we find that throughout the history of the church, that God has been building His church.

378
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Yes, He uses people, and for that we can rejoice.

379
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,740
We understand in Ephesians chapter number 4, we won't take time to go there, but you

380
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,660
can read through the passage of scripture, and you can find how the Lord has, yes, He

381
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:31,700
is the head of the church, but He's established the church, and the positions, and all of

382
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,420
the order for the church, but we understand, ultimately, that He is the head, and that

383
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,740
He builds His church.

384
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,080
We think about these reminders this morning, as the people of God, I believe that we must

385
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,180
be mindful, we must remember that the Lord is still on His throne, number one.

386
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,780
Number two, that the Lord is still building His church.

387
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,340
Number three, the Lord is still saving sinners.

388
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,380
For this I rejoice.

389
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,500
The reality today is that the gospel still works.

390
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,660
Paul said in Romans 1.16, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power

391
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,960
of God unto salvation, to everyone that believe it, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

392
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,060
And we find that as we understand the truth of the Word of God, that the Lord is still

393
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,020
saving sinners.

394
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:28,260
We've heard even during these days of global pandemic, we've heard during these days in

395
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,580
which the church has not been able to assemble as a corporate body of believers.

396
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,900
We've heard during these days in which many of our outreach ministries have been hindered

397
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,100
or stopped completely, yet we've heard of souls that have been saved, lives that have

398
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,900
been changed.

399
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,440
We've had unique opportunities to be able to share the gospel with those that God had

400
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,940
given us opportunities in days gone by, and perhaps we've prayed for, and we've ministered,

401
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,260
and we've sought to encourage and share Scripture.

402
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,500
And then after a period of time, enduring all of this situation, they come to a place

403
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,620
where now they're ready.

404
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,420
We've had many, several even, that we've prayed for as a local church that have trusted Christ

405
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,660
as their personal Savior in the days of this global pandemic.

406
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,220
I've spoken to pastors and evangelists and missionaries, and they too have reported that

407
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:32,300
even in days in which we've not had the ability to minister as we have in our past, that yet

408
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,700
people are being saved, and that's wonderful.

409
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,220
See, the gospel still works.

410
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,779
Romans chapter number 10, what a joy to think about the power of the gospel.

411
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,740
I've often said, as I have preached over the years, that we have the opportunity to give

412
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,420
the Word of God, and as we give God's Word, we understand that the Holy Spirit of God

413
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,420
will use the Word of God in the life of that individual.

414
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,980
I often pray that God will help those individuals that I speak to, some that do not accept the

415
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,779
Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, but they've heard the truth.

416
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:16,820
I pray often that God would remind them that they would, when they pillow their head at

417
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,940
night, remember the words of Scripture and the truth of God's Word with regard to salvation

418
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
and eternity.

419
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,540
I've prayed for people that I've shared the gospel with that God would allow them to have

420
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,300
another gospel witness come into their life.

421
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,140
May it be through, not so much today, someone that might sit on a plane next to them or

422
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,900
in a metro car next to them that would be faithful to give the gospel the same message

423
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,980
that had already been delivered.

424
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,940
And God works that way.

425
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,260
We can rejoice in that.

426
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,059
Romans 10, in verse number 9, the Bible says that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth

427
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:01,180
the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead,

428
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,220
thou shalt be saved.

429
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,020
For at the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto

430
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,980
salvation.

431
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,500
It says in verse number 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall

432
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,140
be saved.

433
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:25,580
I'm thankful that even though we've had certain aspects of ministry hindered over these days

434
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,500
of global pandemic, and though we've dealt with changes in our routine process of propagating

435
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,339
the gospel and going into our community and distributing tracts and all of those things,

436
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,020
I am glad that people can still trust the Lord as their personal Savior, that Jesus

437
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,020
saves.

438
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,140
We sing the song and we believe the message.

439
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,339
See, today we must be reminded of the truth that the Lord is still saving sinners.

440
00:26:52,339 --> 00:27:03,779
Notice in Hebrews chapter number 7, in verse number 25, the Bible is giving us truth here

441
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,740
and we'll get to this passage here, Lord willing, in another month or so as we go through

442
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,460
the truth, the teaching with regard to the priesthood of Christ and after the order of

443
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,940
Melchizedek, not after that of Aaron.

444
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,940
We find in verse 25, however, of Hebrews 7, the Bible says, wherefore He is able also

445
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,740
to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make

446
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,420
intercession for them.

447
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm thankful that the gospel still works.

448
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,860
I'm thankful in the midst of all of that which we're dealing with, and I don't pretend to

449
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,220
act like it's the worst thing that humans have ever dealt with.

450
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,900
I know far better than that.

451
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,059
But some of that we're dealing with, and there are times in which over these periods of weeks

452
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,500
that we've dealt with some of the changes that we've had to implement, that I've had

453
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,700
conversations with fellow pastors and workers, missionaries, evangelists, I've had conversations

454
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,100
with church members, and I've heard people that have been discouraged.

455
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,860
I've heard people that have been just confused and wondering what's going on and is God really

456
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
at work?

457
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,540
And we can rejoice and answer with absolute certainty that God is still working.

458
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
Why?

459
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,619
Because He's still on His throne.

460
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:28,740
He's still the head of the church, and He's still building His church.

461
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,140
And He's still saving sinners.

462
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,700
Number four, if you're taking notes finally this morning, I want you to remember this

463
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,179
truth.

464
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,580
Be mindful of this truth.

465
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,979
Every day of our lives, we ought to remember the fact that the Lord is still coming.

466
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:52,700
We believe in the blood, the book, of course, and the blessed hope.

467
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,540
We believe in the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

468
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,540
And I'm so thankful that the Bible teaches us that Jesus, in fact, is coming again.

469
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,100
In fact, as you would study the portions of Scripture that deal with the return of the

470
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,660
Lord and, of course, the rapture that would then immediately follow, and begin to study

471
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,380
some of those things that will come to pass and the one world order and the Antichrist

472
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,100
and all of those things, if you were to study all of those things and be mindful of the

473
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,140
Bible prophecy that God has given us and you begin to interpret some of those things that

474
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,660
we see happening around our globe today, you can see that the return of the Lord draweth

475
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660
nigh.

476
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,220
And how exciting it is.

477
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:44,559
I spoke with a preacher friend not many days ago, and as we were chatting, we were speaking

478
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,859
about the soon return of the Lord.

479
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:52,020
Now he's older than I am by probably double almost, I don't know, I'm almost 40 now, so

480
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,540
not too many people that are double my age anymore, but close to at least.

481
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,660
And he said to me, he said, Brother Chris, I just want you to be

482
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,940
aware of the fact that in the 70s, I mean almost anywhere you went, you heard

483
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,380
Bible preaching on the return of the Lord. I wasn't even born in the 70s, yet

484
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,780
alone saved in a church in the 70s, but the reality is that I've read books and

485
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,100
I've heard that testimony from a number of people that there was that era in the

486
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,260
70s where there was a bunch of preaching on the soon return of the Lord. And I'm

487
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:34,180
thankful to report that even as this brother told me, many of those that he

488
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,820
was serving with at that time absolutely believed that it would be in

489
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,580
their lifetime. That's one of the wonderful things about the Bible

490
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,620
doctrine and teaching of the imminent return of Christ is it could happen at

491
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,260
any moment. We find that in John chapter number 14, Jesus gives these precious

492
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,340
words. The first three verses of this chapter, you'll remember that at the end

493
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,420
of chapter 13, he had given them truth with regard to the fact that it was only

494
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,300
a little while that he would be with them because why? He was going to go to

495
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,260
the cross. He would be buried and he would rise in victory and then after

496
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,180
those 40 days, he would ascend back to heaven. We find that in John 14, after he

497
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,900
had shared those truths with his disciples, he says, let not your heart be

498
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,780
troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many

499
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,100
mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

500
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,980
He says, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive

501
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:43,180
you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also. I'm so thankful for that

502
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,620
promise of the Lord in verses two and three. He says, I go to

503
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,420
prepare a place for you. He told us he's going to do it and then he says, and if I

504
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,700
go, he says, I will come again. I'm looking for the soon return of our Lord

505
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,900
and Savior Jesus Christ. We find that the book of First Thessalonians gives us

506
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,220
great truth with regard to the rapture and the process in which Paul

507
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,860
is giving this instruction to the believers in Thessalonica and they

508
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,940
needed to understand some things and there had been a much confusion in that

509
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,540
particular day with regard to the day of the Lord and we find that Paul begins

510
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,780
the passage in verse 13 by telling them, I don't want you to be ignorant of these

511
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,900
things. I want you to be informed. I want you to know these things. I'm speaking to

512
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,340
you by the Word of the Lord. He uses that very phrase in verse number 15. For this

513
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,340
we say unto you, by the Word of the Lord. See, Paul is wanting the believers in

514
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,700
Thessalonica to understand this wasn't just Paul's interpretation or Paul's

515
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,220
belief or his opinion. He's giving them the Word of the Lord and how we ought to

516
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,820
rejoice in that today as well. He says in verse number 16, for the Lord Himself

517
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,900
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the

518
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,540
trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and

519
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,780
remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in

520
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,620
the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. You notice the Bible says in verse

521
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:18,140
16, for the Lord Himself shall descend. He doesn't say He might descend. It's

522
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,700
possible that He's going to return. No, He shall. See, I believe that as you look at

523
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,980
the early church history and you look at the book of Acts in particular, I believe

524
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,300
that one of the things that was such a motivator for the believers in the first

525
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,180
century was the soon return of Christ. See, I think about that passage of

526
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,260
Scripture in Acts chapter number 1 where the ascension of Jesus Christ is

527
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,300
recorded and we find that those disciples, they hear the instruction of

528
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,380
the Lord and they hear that truth of the Great Commission, that we're to be

529
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,100
witnesses after we receive power from the Holy Ghost, that we're to be witnesses

530
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,900
unto Him. And then the Bible tells us in Acts 1 how that they see the Lord ascend

531
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:05,180
up into heaven. In my mind's eye, I could stand there with those disciples along

532
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,380
those, in that very same place, alongside these disciples and I can hear the words

533
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,860
of Jesus as He's speaking to them and reminding them of His mission that He's

534
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,060
leaving them with and then He's taken up out of their sight. And the Bible tells

535
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,260
that they stand there, they're looking, gazing up into heaven. What happens? The

536
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,940
Bible tells us that as they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as He went up,

537
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,700
behold, two men stood by them with white apparel, in white apparel, and here's

538
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,060
what they said, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

539
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:46,420
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like

540
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,380
manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven. Now think about that. They'd

541
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,540
received the truth, the mission from the Lord in verse 8, but ye shall receive

542
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,260
power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. And ye shall be witnesses unto

543
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,340
me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost part of the

544
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,580
earth. And then He's ascended out of their sight. They stand there gazing,

545
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:13,300
these angels come and say He's coming back. We better get busy doing what

546
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,700
He left for us to do. And you read the book of Acts and you see a group of

547
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,660
people that were motivated to do what God told them to do. Why? They didn't know

548
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,700
when He's coming back, but they knew He's coming back. If I tell my children, we

549
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,940
want you to do these things and we'll be back, and I don't tell them when we're

550
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,380
going to be back. I hope that the reminder in the confirmation to them

551
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,140
that we're going to return, that we're going to come back and see what you've

552
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:49,220
done, that it would be a motivator for them to do what we told them to do. I was

553
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,820
a kid once and I remember waiting until the very last minute to do what it was

554
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,460
that maybe I thought I was supposed to do. But I tell you as the people of God,

555
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,740
we don't know when Jesus is coming back. And when He comes, there's not going to

556
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,460
be any time for us to hurry up and do this or the other thing because the

557
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,140
Bible says in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, I mean just like

558
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,060
that, He's coming back. What a joy, what a great promise. In the book of Titus, Paul

559
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:25,220
tells his son in the faith, he uses that terminology for both Titus and Timothy.

560
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,380
In fact, you see that he's writing to Philemon, he mentions that of Onesimus

561
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,940
as well. But here in Titus 2, in verse number 13, he says,

562
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,220
looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and

563
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:46,180
our Savior, Jesus Christ. I'm looking for His soon return. In the book of Hebrews,

564
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,460
we have wonderful truth with regard to the coming of the Lord. I don't know when

565
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,980
we're gonna get to these chapters because it's chapter 9 and 10. We might

566
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,980
have Hebrews part 2, as far as I know. I have no idea what's gonna happen for

567
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:05,620
2021, but I want to remind you in Hebrews 9 and verse 28, the Bible says,

568
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:12,420
so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for

569
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,540
Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation. Notice what

570
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,860
he says in chapter 10 and verse number 37, for yet a little while and He that

571
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:34,740
shall come will come and will not tarry. Listen, Jesus is coming right on time. We

572
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,420
don't know the time, but there's a time that Jesus is coming. And we understand

573
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:47,260
biblically speaking that He will not tarry. We, James, in chapter 5 and verse

574
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,300
number 8, the Bible says, be also patient, establish your hearts for the coming of

575
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,420
the Lord draweth nigh. The coming of the Lord draweth nigh. And, of course, we're familiar with the

576
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:04,020
passage in 2 Peter 3. In fact, I mentioned it just on Wednesday evening

577
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,220
with those scoffers and saying, where is the promise of His coming, you know? They

578
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,460
believe that... the thing that's interesting is that they were aware of

579
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,260
the promise of His coming. But they said, where is the promise of His coming? We

580
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,060
find that as the text of Scripture goes on, we eventually get to verse number

581
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,340
8, and the Bible says there, but beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that

582
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,900
one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years is one day.

583
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,500
2 Peter 3 and verse number 8. See, our God is eternal. He operates outside of

584
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,020
time. We find that He then gives this wonderful truth in verse number 9

585
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,860
of 2 Peter 3. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men

586
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,940
count slackness. But as longsuffering to us were, not willing that any should

587
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,900
perish, but that all should come to repentance. Reminds me of our third point,

588
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,380
the Lord is still saving sinners. But we can rest assured this morning that the

589
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,020
Lord is still going to come. He's coming again. I don't know the hour. I'm not

590
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,820
telling you it's going to be today. I'm not trying to set a time. Many that have

591
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,060
gone before us that have done that have proven themselves to be unwise. But the

592
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:27,860
Bible teaches us the imminent return of Jesus Christ. And this morning, as we are

593
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,860
celebrating Memorial Day as a nation, tomorrow of course the official

594
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,260
observance, there's some things no doubt that we need to remember as Americans.

595
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,580
There are some things no doubt that have not been adequately and properly

596
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:50,340
taught to a new generation about the sacrifice that was made by millions of

597
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:56,140
people for us to enjoy the freedom that we have today. What a blessing that is.

598
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:02,580
And I'm thankful to be American, to live in this nation.

599
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,740
But my citizenship is in heaven.

600
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,460
I'm a child of the King.

601
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Amen?

602
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,020
I've been born again.

603
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,340
We sang the song this morning since I have been redeemed.

604
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,380
I have dual citizenship, American, but heaven is my home.

605
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,600
The songwriter said, this road is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

606
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,220
And oh, how we can relate to the songwriter.

607
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,260
And as the people of God, just as the warning is given in Deuteronomy chapter number 6,

608
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,660
when you're entered into the land that I've promised to give you, when I bring you into

609
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,220
that land, God did it, God worked, God proved His power and He brought the children of Israel

610
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,300
into the land.

611
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,460
And Moses says, beware lest thou forget the Lord.

612
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,040
So there were some things that the children of Israel were instructed to do to establish

613
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,400
memorials so that they would not forget what God did for them.

614
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,840
We find that Peter says, I'll put you in remembrance of some things.

615
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,200
I want you to be mindful of some things.

616
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,720
We understand the Lord's given us the truth as New Testament believers of baptism and

617
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
the Lord's Supper.

618
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,480
In fact, the table that is before me says, this do in remembrance of me.

619
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,480
You can read in 1 Corinthians 11 and you can see how the Lord's table, it's a table

620
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
of remembrance.

621
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,760
It's a memorial to be mindful of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for me to remember what

622
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,760
my salvation cost.

623
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,040
It was free to me, but Jesus died.

624
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,620
Yes, He was buried and He rose in victory and how we rejoice in that truth.

625
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,880
But this morning, as the people of God living in a day of confusion and chaos, and there

626
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,720
are people that are discouraged and confused, I want you to remember that the Lord's still

627
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
on His throne.

628
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,240
I want you to remember that the Lord's still building His church.

629
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,200
I want you to remember the Lord's still saving sinners.

630
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,000
And I want you to remember that the Lord is coming again.

631
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,280
And we remember those things and I, as I admitted in the beginning of the message, there's 50

632
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,080
other things that we could speak about that we need to remember.

633
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Remember those four things.

634
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,400
I believe it'll help us.

635
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,560
It'll help us in a time of chaos and confusion.

636
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,720
Remember, Father, we love You.

637
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,820
We thank You for loving us.

638
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:34,160
We thank You for Your Word.

639
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,800
How we rejoice that You have given us this precious Bible.

640
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,280
The truth that is contained therein is profitable, is life-changing.

641
00:42:45,280 --> 00:43:01,720
And Lord, I pray that as we have reviewed these four items today, I've sought to stir

642
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,880
us up by putting us in remembrance.

643
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,960
I'm so thankful that You're sitting upon Your throne, that You are the Lord God omnipotent,

644
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,600
that You reign, that You are King of kings and Lord of lords, the great I Am.

645
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,680
How we rejoice in that.

646
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,840
We thank You that You're still building Your church.

647
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,400
It's Your church, not my church, not our church.

648
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,480
I'm thankful to belong to the local church.

649
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,560
I'm thankful to be part of the local church.

650
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm thankful for the privilege of being the under-shepherd of this local church.

651
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,680
God, we know that You're the head.

652
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,400
We believe the promise that You gave there in Matthew, I will build my church and the

653
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,400
gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

654
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,240
Oh, how we rejoice that You're still saving sinners.

655
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,080
The gospel's powerful.

656
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,120
What a joy to know that the truth, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall

657
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,120
be saved, is still in operation today.

658
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,120
If there's one that's tuned in that's not sure of heaven, God, we pray that today is

659
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,380
the day of salvation.

660
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,640
They would not allow for another moment to pass by before they place their faith and

661
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,880
trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

662
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,360
Understanding that their works, their good works, cannot get them to heaven, not by works

663
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:29,640
of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy hath He begotten us.

664
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,640
For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift

665
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,960
of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

666
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,640
Our salvation is not based upon our works, it's not based upon our church membership,

667
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,720
our baptism, any other thing.

668
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,920
We're saved if we trust the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, receive the gift of

669
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:58,120
God which is eternal life through the death, burial, and resurrection of our Savior.

670
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,360
We thank You that You're still saving sinners, and then how we rejoice that You're still

671
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,000
coming again.

672
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,440
We readily admit we do not know the day nor hour, but we believe the promises that You've

673
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,480
given us in Your Word, I will come again.

674
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,720
That He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

675
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,560
God, I pray that You'd help us to redeem the time that we'd be busy about the Master's

676
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:35,120
work, that we'd have that same level of urgency that we read of in the book of Acts, because

677
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,920
we believe You're coming, and it could be at any moment.

678
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,520
Lord, as we remember these things this morning, I pray that our hearts have been encouraged

679
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,400
and strengthened.

680
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,440
I pray that You'd give us a joy and a peace at the remembrance of these things.

681
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,560
We pray that You'd work in the time of invitation, that You alone would be glorified, that decisions

682
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,480
would be made here, would be made at the homes of those that have tuned in to watch

683
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
this broadcast.

684
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,760
Lord, that You would work in our hearts and lives, and that You alone would be glorified.

685
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,320
We'll thank You for it, in Christ's name we pray, amen.

686
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,640
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, hear the altars.
