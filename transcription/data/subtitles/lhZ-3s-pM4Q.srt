1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,559
She made it back safely on Monday evening.

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:05,579
And so we thank the Lord for that.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:08,199
And she just has a few more weeks

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,579
and then she'll be done her first year.

5
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:13,680
It's hard to believe, but continue to pray for her,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,560
pray for Kiademe.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,120
She also has just a few weeks left

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,280
until she's finished with her first year.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,120
And it's hard to believe how quickly time goes.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,500
And we're thankful that both Kiademe and Brianne

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,340
are doing well.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,840
Thank you for praying for them.

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,280
First Thessalonians chapter five this evening,

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,360
First Thessalonians chapter number five.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,580
We started in verse number 12 about three months ago now.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,240
And we've been studying through these instructions

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,479
that God gives to the church there in Thessalonica.

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,880
And he begins with, we beseech you.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,400
And then of course he transitions in verse 14.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,319
We exhort you and we find that as we've read through

21
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:54,479
and studied these particular instructions,

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,439
that we would say that the closing section of this book

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,560
is packed with powerful truth.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,000
And I would call it profitable instruction.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,919
We understand that God's word is profitable.

26
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:09,480
We understand that the second Timothy chapter three

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,959
in verse number 16 tells us that all scripture

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,800
is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,720
It tells us what it's profitable for,

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,680
but this is profitable instruction.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
And we find that every New Testament church

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,919
should have a desire to walk worthy and please God.

33
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,599
That of course has been the title for this series

34
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,000
over the last 13 weeks.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400
And this evening as we examine two verses of scripture,

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,599
we've been spending, really in verse 14,

37
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,879
we spent several weeks looking at each phrase.

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,660
And then over the next several weeks,

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,199
we've kind of just dealt with one verse per week.

40
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:46,040
But this evening, verse number 20 and 21

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,580
really tie together and establish a single truth

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,779
that needs to be understood.

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,699
And really, I believe that the scriptures are clear

44
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,360
that we are to be sound in the faith.

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,699
We find that God has desire for his children

46
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:08,500
and for his churches to be sound in the faith.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,479
That word sound means to be healthy.

48
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,779
It means to be free from any mixture of error.

49
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:18,820
You will find the phrase there in the book of Titus

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,619
of being sound in the faith.

51
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,300
You'll find in the book of Titus

52
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,220
and the book of 1 Timothy

53
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,399
and a number of other books as well,

54
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:29,660
where they'll use the word sound doctrine

55
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,339
and that which is free of any error, mixture of error.

56
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:37,139
And so we find that God desires for his people,

57
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,720
his churches to be sound in the faith.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,059
As you read the pastoral epistles,

59
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,979
as you read the letters that are given

60
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,380
to the New Testament churches,

61
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,699
such as this one to the church at Thessalonica,

62
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:52,059
you will know that there is an emphasis placed

63
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:56,539
on the importance of being settled, grounded,

64
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,860
and established in the faith.

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,979
And that's what God wants for his people.

66
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,380
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro.

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,139
He doesn't want every time some new thing comes up

68
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,460
for us to be swaying back and forth

69
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,779
and we're over here and we're over there

70
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:10,660
and we don't know what.

71
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,179
No, he wants us to be settled and grounded

72
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,339
and to have that solid foundation.

73
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:20,539
And so God provided us with his word

74
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,860
and we believe the Bible is the sole authority

75
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,979
for faith and for practice.

76
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:31,539
And so I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

77
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,220
We understand that the church in Thessalonica

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,300
and many of the churches, as we look at the churches

79
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,779
that are written to here in the New Testament,

80
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,339
they did not have the entire Bible

81
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,059
like we have this evening.

82
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,940
And so we understand that God,

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,619
during that foundational period of time

84
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,860
that we often refer to as the early church age,

85
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,179
in the first century, that God had established

86
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,339
that there would be some apostolic sign gifts,

87
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,660
that there would be some truth

88
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,899
with regard to some spiritual gifts

89
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,059
that would be for that era of time.

90
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,779
And we see really that here,

91
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,100
as we look at this portion of scripture,

92
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,339
that he's dealing with part of that,

93
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,139
but we find that it's been preserved for us this evening

94
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,220
and it's applicable for every church

95
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,100
throughout the church age.

96
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,940
We have the whole Bible and we ought to be thankful for that

97
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,179
and here in these two verses of scripture,

98
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,380
I believe that God provides his people

99
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,540
with a simple formula that will enable

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,619
individual believers and churches

101
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,700
to be sound in the faith.

102
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,619
Notice what he says in verse number 20,

103
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:42,540
despise not prophesying, verse 21,

104
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,579
prove all things, hold fast that which is good.

105
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,779
Really, those three statements are going to serve

106
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,260
as our three points for an outline this evening.

107
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,579
And so number one, verse number 20,

108
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,700
despise not prophesying,

109
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
as I've titled the message this evening,

110
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,739
sound in the faith.

111
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:04,299
How can we be sound in the faith?

112
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,260
How could this church, the church in Thessalonica,

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,619
how could they be sound in the faith?

114
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,339
How could any church be sound in the faith?

115
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,140
Maybe we can ask this question as well this evening.

116
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,540
Are there churches that are not sound in the faith?

117
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,739
Obviously, the answer is obvious to that question.

118
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,739
There are an abundance of churches

119
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,540
that are not sound in the faith.

120
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,779
How can we make that statement this evening?

121
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,859
Well, because what they teach and what they practice

122
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:37,700
doesn't align with the book that God gave us, the Bible.

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,140
And I'm so thankful for that little song that we sing,

124
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,100
so often with the children in Sunday school, the B-I-B-L-E.

125
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,700
Yes, that's the book for me.

126
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,459
I stand alone on the word of God, the B-I-B-L-E.

127
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,980
And God's given us the authoritative word,

128
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,980
and that is certainly reason to rejoice.

129
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,980
But we find first this evening, despise not prophesying.

130
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,859
So we have to understand,

131
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,920
as we look at this verse of scripture,

132
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,820
what is it that Paul is referring to?

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,279
What are these prophecies, if you will,

134
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,040
these prophesying that Paul is referring to

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,839
when he says despise not prophesying?

136
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,320
Well, we have to understand this evening

137
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,559
the ministry of prophets.

138
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,959
What is the ministry of prophets?

139
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,600
Well, prior to the New Testament being completed,

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,000
we find that prophets would speak

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,140
direct revelation from God.

142
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,920
Now that the Bible is completed,

143
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,000
we find that there are no longer prophets

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,440
in the sense of speaking direct revelation from God.

145
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,480
For the Bible, the canon of scripture is closed.

146
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,600
Now we could look at a preacher and say,

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
some might use that terminology,

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,279
that they're forth telling, they're giving truth.

149
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,799
But the reality is that that office of a prophet,

150
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:00,119
when Paul was speaking here about despise not prophesying,

151
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,920
we must understand what the New Testament teaches us

152
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,500
about the ministry of prophets.

153
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,140
Understand also this evening that prophets,

154
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,980
apostles and prophets,

155
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,339
were the foundation of the local church.

156
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,619
We understand that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone.

157
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:21,140
The prophets and the apostles are the foundation.

158
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,179
And then we find that Peter refers to,

159
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:24,980
we see in the book of Ephesians as well,

160
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,700
that we are lively stones.

161
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,980
We're like the bricks of the structure of the church,

162
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,019
if we could think about it in that image this evening.

163
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,500
And so look back, if you will, to the book of Ephesians,

164
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,779
and notice what God tells us about prophets.

165
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,459
And it helps us to understand what Paul is dealing with here

166
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,140
in the church in Thessalonica,

167
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,380
when he says despise not prophesying.

168
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,160
It's Ephesians chapter two.

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,100
Look, if you will, with me at verse number 20.

170
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,820
Now, obviously we're jumping at the end

171
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,940
of a text of scripture,

172
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,220
and he's talked already about their new position in Christ,

173
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,820
because these people have been saved by the grace of God.

174
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,899
And he says this in verse number 20,

175
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,100
and are built upon the foundation

176
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,260
of the apostles and prophets,

177
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.

178
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,380
So Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone,

179
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,459
and the apostles and the prophets,

180
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,220
according to verse 20, are the foundation.

181
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,820
If you look back in verse 19,

182
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,020
he talks about our position in Christ

183
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,099
and of the household of God.

184
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,539
And again, seeing in verse 21,

185
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,859
in whom all the building fitly framed together,

186
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:42,859
groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,

187
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,940
in whom you also are builded together

188
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,460
for an habitation of God through the spirit.

189
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,419
And so we find this evening in Ephesians 2.20,

190
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,659
this truth that the apostles and the prophets

191
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,239
are the foundation of the church.

192
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,979
Look in chapter three, if you will, in verse number five,

193
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:03,340
the Bible says this, which in other ages,

194
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,260
he's talking about this mystery,

195
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,900
which in other ages was not made known

196
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,859
unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed

197
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,859
unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit.

198
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,099
And so this is God's revelation, again,

199
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,580
as we would speak about the ministry of prophets

200
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,539
before the completion of the New Testament,

201
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,859
that they would speak direct revelation from God.

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
And so he gives us this truth

203
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,840
in verse number five of chapter three.

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,179
Again, look over in chapter number four, if you will,

205
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,539
in verse number 11, and we really could read down

206
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,260
a few verses, we'll read verses 11 through 14,

207
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,820
and notice the various offices that are spoken of here.

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,739
In Ephesians four, in verse number 11,

209
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,820
it says, and he gave some apostles.

210
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,900
Now, if you look back in the text, in verses seven and eight,

211
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,539
you talk about the gifts that he's given to every man

212
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,380
and understand that he here.

213
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,460
is referring to God, he gave some apostles

214
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,220
and some prophets and some evangelists

215
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
and some pastors and teachers.

216
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,220
So what was the purpose that God gave these offices?

217
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,460
He equipped the church with these offices.

218
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,500
Notice in verse number 12,

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,140
for the perfecting of the saints,

220
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,340
for the work of the ministry,

221
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,820
for the edifying of the body of Christ,

222
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,780
till we all come in the unity of the faith

223
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
and with the knowledge of the Son of God

224
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,060
unto a perfect man,

225
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,900
unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

226
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,860
that we, notice this, henceforth,

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,740
be no more children tossed to and fro

228
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,380
and carried about with every wind of doctrine

229
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,180
by the slight of men and cunning craftiness,

230
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,420
whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

231
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,780
And so understand that false teachers,

232
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,020
they're very subtle in their approach.

233
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,460
Understand that they're lying in wait to deceive.

234
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,040
This is the revelation that God has given us

235
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
with regard to their craftiness.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,580
He says, by the slight of men, every wind of doctrine.

237
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,540
And obviously there were false teachers

238
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,040
that were prevalent in the early church age,

239
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,580
just as there are today.

240
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,220
We find that in the Old Testament, there were false prophets.

241
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,620
We can read of all of those things.

242
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,660
And so we find that we understand

243
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,340
prior to the completion of the New Testament,

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,700
what was the ministry of a prophet?

245
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,140
Well, to give the word of God,

246
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,100
that direct revelation from God.

247
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,940
So here, Paul is saying, despise not prophesying.

248
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,740
There are gonna be some that come in

249
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,220
that are going to speak to you the truth.

250
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,620
Despise not prophesying.

251
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,780
We find that it doesn't end there.

252
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,180
We'll look at verse 21 in just a moment.

253
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,620
But let me just say this,

254
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,460
because as we look at this passage of scripture

255
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,500
and understand that we today are not in the same position

256
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,860
as the church at Thessalonica.

257
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,100
The church in Thessalonica didn't have a whole Bible.

258
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,060
We have a whole Bible.

259
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,180
So what is the ministry of a prophet?

260
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,559
Well, apostles and prophets are no more

261
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,500
in the sense that they were

262
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,620
at the writing of the New Testament.

263
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,260
And so therefore, we find that after the completion

264
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,220
of the New Testament, here's what the New Testament says.

265
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,980
In 1 Corinthians chapter 13, in fact, turn there,

266
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,660
because I want you to see it.

267
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,419
In verses eight through 10, notice what the Bible says,

268
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,540
and it deals with tongues as well

269
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,300
as we read the portion of scripture.

270
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,639
But I want you to see what it says

271
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,540
with regard to prophecies.

272
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,660
In 1 Corinthians chapter 13, in verse number eight,

273
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,020
of course, many of you know, 1 Corinthians 13,

274
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,240
people refer to it as what?

275
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,820
The love chapter, it's about charity.

276
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,900
And he says in verse number eight, charity never faileth.

277
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,900
But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail.

278
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,660
Do you see that?

279
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
It then goes on, it says whether there be tongues,

280
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,700
they shall cease.

281
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,660
Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away,

282
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,380
for we know in part, and we prophesy in part,

283
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,220
but when that which is perfect is come,

284
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,500
then that which is in part shall be done away.

285
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
And we find that as we look here

286
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,900
and we think about Peter, excuse me, James,

287
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,779
talking about in James chapter number one,

288
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,660
the perfect law of liberty,

289
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,940
and that we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

290
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,820
He talks about the one that looks into the mirror

291
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,300
and he uses that illustration

292
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,639
and he looks into the perfect law of liberty.

293
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,620
So when the word of God is complete,

294
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,100
as we see in verse number 10,

295
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,059
they didn't have the complete New Testament

296
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,260
or the complete Bible, we now do.

297
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,940
And so he says that these things that are in part

298
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,820
shall be done away.

299
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,300
Notice in verse number eight,

300
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,860
it says whether there be prophecies,

301
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,460
notice they shall fail.

302
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,360
Now, is that a statement that is absolute?

303
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,980
They shall fail, that's what's going to happen.

304
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,540
What does the word fail mean?

305
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,240
It does not mean that the prophecies

306
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,840
aren't going to come to pass.

307
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
So you think about the Old Testament,

308
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,620
when there's a prophet, if a prophet is known,

309
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,360
whether they're a true prophet or a false prophet

310
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,020
was whether or not their prophecies came to pass, right?

311
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,419
That was a test that was given of Old Testament prophets.

312
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,700
This is not what that word fail mean.

313
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,940
It doesn't mean that somebody made a prophecy

314
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,300
and it did not come to pass, it failed.

315
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,899
No, this word fail means to cause to cease,

316
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,100
to end or to be done away.

317
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,779
So what is he revealing to us?

318
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:34,899
Well, prophecies in the sense of speaking

319
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,820
the direct revelation from God,

320
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,899
as we see prior to the New Testament being completed,

321
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,140
that after the New Testament is completed,

322
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,540
after the Bible is completed, then prophecies shall fail.

323
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
They're going to cease.

324
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,140
We don't need them anymore.

325
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,899
God's given us the Bible.

326
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,220
He's given us the whole canon of Scripture

327
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,860
and therefore no one is speaking

328
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,100
any direct revelation from God.

329
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,100
God has given his complete revelation in his word.

330
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,059
Does that make sense this evening?

331
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,940
So then he says, whether they be tongues, they shall cease.

332
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,300
I just had this conversation

333
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,980
at the dinner table this evening.

334
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,020
Somebody came up with, somebody sent a note to Juliana

335
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,220
about some speaking tongues situation.

336
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,300
We began to talk about it.

337
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,660
And I said, the question that people have to answer

338
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,520
is that the Bible says they shall cease.

339
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
When?

340
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,660
When, when are they gonna cease?

341
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,300
Well, according to the text, as you read through the text,

342
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,980
when that which is perfect is come,

343
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,179
that's when they're going to cease.

344
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,940
So we look here and we find, again, there are people today,

345
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,380
there are groups of churches you can go to

346
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,899
that still would believe in prophecies

347
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,200
and they would believe in speaking in tongues

348
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,580
and yet they don't follow the biblical pattern

349
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,380
or the biblical instruction that's been given.

350
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,660
And we find here this evening that God is very clear

351
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,940
in his word, as we can go Scripture with Scripture,

352
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,540
comparing Scripture with Scripture,

353
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,260
what it is that they had the responsibility of receiving

354
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,300
and how for every church throughout the church age,

355
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,559
how we would deal with this.

356
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,899
Again, they did not have a complete Bible,

357
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,820
so therefore God was still giving his word

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,380
through prophecies, through prophesying,

359
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,020
as we would see in this text of Scripture.

360
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,100
Therefore, as we look at ourselves today

361
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,380
as a New Testament church

362
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,380
and looking at having the complete canon of Scripture,

363
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,380
we do not need any office of a prophet.

364
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,100
There's no longer prophesying in that sense.

365
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Absolutely, it is true today that God still uses evangelists

366
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,339
and pastors to preach his word.

367
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,540
That's why Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4,

368
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,739
preach the word.

369
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:52,020
That's why we find that as you look at the entirety

370
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,260
of Ephesians 4, verse number 11,

371
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,179
he talks about apostles, prophets, evangelists,

372
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,860
pastors and teachers.

373
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,700
And we see again that the foundation of the church

374
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,940
was laid Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone,

375
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,779
the foundation, the apostles and the prophets.

376
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,200
And so we find that the first thing that is given

377
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,619
to the church in Thessalonica is despise not prophesying.

378
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,779
If I could look at that and try to apply it

379
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,279
for us this evening,

380
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,980
I would say that when the word of God is being preached,

381
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,839
we ought not despise it.

382
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,980
We ought to accept the truth of God's word.

383
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,920
And in fact, we ought to desire to hear the word of God

384
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
being proclaimed.

385
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,580
We ought to make sure that we're in a place

386
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,140
where the word of God is being proclaimed.

387
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,179
We don't go somewhere, we don't go find a church

388
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,559
based on wanting to know what kind of ministries

389
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,179
or programs do you have and what do you have for this

390
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,179
and what do you have for that

391
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,619
and where do you take the teenagers during the summer

392
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,020
and this, that and the other thing.

393
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,420
And there's a lot of people that that's what they look for

394
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,059
in finding a church.

395
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,899
And they don't really have as a primary factor

396
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,980
how the preaching is handled.

397
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,940
But I would say that first and foremost,

398
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,020
we better be concerned with the preaching of God's word

399
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,020
and we should despise not the preaching,

400
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,980
despise not prophesying is what he says

401
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,660
to the church in Thessalonica.

402
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,739
Now notice as we move on verse 21,

403
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,020
number two, if you're taking notes,

404
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,779
he says prove all things, prove all things.

405
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,339
What does it mean to prove?

406
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,580
It means to test or to examine.

407
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,400
It means to scrutinize.

408
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,340
It means to determine if a thing is genuine.

409
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,099
All right, so that's what the word means, prove.

410
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,619
So here he says prove all things.

411
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:47,419
So I want you to think about the church in Thessalonica

412
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,820
and I want you to think about this despise not prophesying.

413
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,099
But there are false prophets, there are false teachers.

414
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,940
So when somebody is coming and they say,

415
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,140
I have a prophecy from the Lord, I'm gonna prophesy.

416
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,179
All right, despise not prophesying

417
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,179
but coupled together prove all things.

418
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,500
And so how is it that we today

419
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,179
are going to prove all things?

420
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,059
How is it that they could prove all things?

421
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,580
Well, we find that they obviously

422
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,700
had the apostolic authority of Paul and Peter and John

423
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,859
and so on and so forth.

424
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,380
But we noticed something in the church at Berea.

425
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,739
So look over at Acts chapter 17, if you will.

426
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:31,220
And we often reference the Bereans.

427
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,140
And we talk about the behavior of the Bereans

428
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,140
when it came to Paul going there and preaching the word.

429
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,299
Now we find that here Paul was only there

430
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,460
for a very short time.

431
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,559
In fact, he went to Berea because

432
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,179
of being run out of Thessalonica.

433
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,780
And that's where the chapter begins in Thessalonica

434
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,059
and then he's run out of there

435
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,059
because of all of the turmoil and opposition.

436
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,460
It says in verse number 10.

437
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,520
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas

438
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,920
by night unto Berea, who coming thither

439
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,800
went into the synagogue of the Jews.

440
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Isn't that awesome?

441
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,240
Paul was so concerned, everywhere he went

442
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,480
to preach the truth of the gospel, to let it be known,

443
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,200
and so he finds himself being carried over to Berea

444
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
because of the opposition in Thessalonica,

445
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,680
and he goes into the synagogue of the Jews,

446
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,080
and he goes in to teach and to preach.

447
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,380
We find that in verse number two,

448
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,280
it says this was his manner,

449
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,080
and he reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

450
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,320
and so look in verse number 11,

451
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
the Bible says these, those in Berea,

452
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,780
these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,

453
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,000
in that they received the word,

454
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,920
notice what it says, with all readiness of mind.

455
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,160
But notice, and searched the scriptures daily

456
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,000
for what purpose, whether those things were so.

457
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,640
So Paul comes and he's reasoning with them

458
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
out of the scriptures, this is his manner

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
according to verses two and three,

460
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,280
when he gets to Thessalonica,

461
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,680
so we could easily assume, and I think properly assume,

462
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,040
that when he gets into Thessalonica,

463
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,480
he does the same thing.

464
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,160
And so in verse number three of the text,

465
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,240
it says, opening and alleging that Christ must needs

466
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,560
have suffered and risen again from the dead,

467
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,080
and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.

468
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
And so I believe that Paul went to Berea

469
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,200
with the same message, and so they received the word

470
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,640
with all readiness of mind.

471
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,160
They weren't despising prophecies, prophesying,

472
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,320
and so they received the word with all readiness of mind,

473
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,680
but then it says they searched the scriptures daily

474
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,520
whether these things were so.

475
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
How do we prove all things?

476
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,920
How could the church in Thessalonica prove all things?

477
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,480
Well, they did have the Old Testament,

478
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,560
and they were able to go,

479
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,260
and they were able to prove all things.

480
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,500
Of course, the apostolic authority,

481
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
as I mentioned a moment ago,

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,340
but then I want you to think about

483
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,900
the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

484
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,100
Now, again, we have the whole canon of scripture,

485
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,620
and what a blessing that is,

486
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,900
but we understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

487
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,080
The Bible tells us in the Gospel of John

488
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,300
that he will guide us into all truth,

489
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,460
lead us into all truth.

490
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,100
That's a ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

491
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,060
and I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit,

492
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,220
at the moment of salvation, indwells every believer.

493
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Those that were saved in Thessalonica

494
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,900
when they got saved,

495
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,800
they got the Holy Spirit just like we do.

496
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,900
So the Holy Spirit of God lives within them.

497
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,780
Have you ever heard something or read something

498
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,340
and just something didn't sit right with you,

499
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,460
and you didn't really know what it was?

500
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,980
Is the Holy Spirit not,

501
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,420
the Holy Spirit was not confirming what you were hearing.

502
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,820
Has that ever happened?

503
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,200
You start reading the wrong book,

504
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,220
you start listening to the wrong person on YouTube

505
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,340
or wherever it might be,

506
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,220
and all of a sudden something's being said,

507
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,340
there's some kind of, and you're like,

508
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,220
eh, something's not right here.

509
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,160
The Holy Spirit's giving you this uneasy feeling

510
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,260
that there's just not something right.

511
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,900
And then you go to the Scriptures and you trust the Lord

512
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,280
and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth

513
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,460
as he promises to do so.

514
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,100
Again, John 14 and verse number 26,

515
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,060
the Bible says this in that portion of Scripture,

516
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,300
"'But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,

517
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,000
"'whom the Father will send in my name,

518
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,540
"'he shall teach you all things

519
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,980
"'and bring all things to your remembrance,

520
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,420
"'whatsoever I have said unto you.'"

521
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,820
And then in chapter 15, excuse me,

522
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,100
chapter 16 and verse number 13,

523
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,060
the Bible says this,

524
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,980
"'Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come,

525
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,460
"'he will guide you into all truth,

526
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,940
"'for he shall not speak of himself,

527
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,600
"'but whatsoever he shall hear,

528
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,640
"'that shall he speak,

529
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,820
"'and he will show you things to come.'"

530
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,660
And so we have those promises from Jesus

531
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,300
with regard to the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

532
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,600
And so as the people of God today,

533
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,740
when we look at this admonition,

534
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,460
this really, if you think about it,

535
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,500
as I mentioned already,

536
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,500
this formula for how an individual believer or a church

537
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,600
could be sound in the faith,

538
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,280
we are to prove all things.

539
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,020
Go to the Bible and ask the Holy Spirit

540
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,220
to commune with your spirit.

541
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,260
Look over at 1 John chapter four,

542
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,220
and I'm gonna read all of the verses

543
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,100
where I've actually turned there.

544
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,540
I just referenced John 14 and 16,

545
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,040
but look at 1 John chapter four, if you will.

546
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,940
In 1 John chapter number four,

547
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,340
notice how we begin this chapter.

548
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,340
It says, "'Beloved, believe not every spirit.'"

549
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,220
But what's the admonition?

550
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,220
"'But try the spirits, whether they are of God.'"

551
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

552
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,780
Did God know that there would be false teachers

553
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,700
and false prophets?

554
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,540
Sure He did.

555
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,840
So what did He do?

556
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,660
Well, He gave warning and instruction to His people

557
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,660
on how they are to try the spirits and prove all things.

558
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,360
And so He tells them in verse number two,

559
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,740
"'Hereby know ye the Spirit of God,

560
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,360
"'every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ

561
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,000
"'has come in the flesh is of God.

562
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,960
"'And every spirit that confesseth not

563
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,080
"'that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.

564
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,680
"'And this is that spirit of antichrist,

565
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,740
"'whereof ye have heard that it should come,

566
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,120
"'and even now already is it in the world.'"

567
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,800
Now, we know that one day during the tribulation

568
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,240
that the antichrist is going to show up,

569
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,160
but the spirit of antichrist is already working.

570
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,800
We see that, we know here it's already in the world.

571
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,720
And then He says, "'Ye are of God, little children,

572
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,560
"'and have overcome them, because greater is he

573
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,980
"'that is in you than he that is in the world.

574
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,080
"'They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world,

575
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,860
"'and the world heareth them.

576
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,500
"'We are of God.

577
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,480
"'He that knoweth God heareth us,

578
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,600
"'he that is not of God heareth not us.

579
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,180
"'Hereby know we the spirit of truth

580
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,080
"'and the spirit of error.'"

581
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,040
This simple statement in verse number 21,

582
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,360
prove all things, it reminds us of the importance

583
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,360
of knowing the word of God and walking in the spirit.

584
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,640
Listen, there's a lot of stuff out there today.

585
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,920
There's a lot of preachers on the internet.

586
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,440
I'm not gonna suggest that every one of them is wrong,

587
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
because there's some good ones out there.

588
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
But I'm telling you, prove all things.

589
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
That's what the Bible tells us

590
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,080
as part of the formula.

591
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,160
Listen, there's a lot of books out there,

592
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,840
a lot of books that you can get your hands on,

593
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,960
and sometimes those books have false teaching in them.

594
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
There might be a couple of good things,

595
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,840
but then there's some bad things in them,

596
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
and you gotta be really careful to prove all things.

597
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,640
What does the Bible say?

598
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,520
We gotta know the word.

599
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,100
And so Paul says, if we're going to be sound in the faith,

600
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,520
and that's the goal, then we must despise not prophesying,

601
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,120
prove all things, and then notice how he ends verse 21,

602
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,080
hold fast that which is good.

603
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,720
Now, when we see that word hold fast,

604
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,920
it means to keep secure, or to keep possession of.

605
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,880
And you think about keeping possession,

606
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,800
keeping firm possession of something.

607
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,880
He says, hold fast that which is good.

608
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,880
So once you have received, and once you have proven,

609
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,460
then hold fast.

610
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,160
I've had people ask me before, are you open-minded?

611
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Well, I can only be as open-minded

612
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
as God's word allows me to be, amen?

613
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,240
Listen, I'm not open-minded

614
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,080
that there's another way to heaven, amen?

615
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,120
And people can say, oh, you're closed-minded,

616
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,560
you're narrow, you're this, you're that.

617
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Listen, the Bible says that Jesus is the only way,

618
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,200
does it not?

619
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,480
And so once we have received the word,

620
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,060
and once we have proved, then we hold fast.

621
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
You know, so many people today are saying,

622
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,500
we should change, we need to change this and change that,

623
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,960
and become more accommodating, and try to,

624
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,240
listen, we gotta hold fast to the truth.

625
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,440
What truth of God's word are you willing to let go of?

626
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,440
I don't wanna let go of any of it,

627
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,640
because God gave it to us

628
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,080
so that we could walk worthy and please him, amen?

629
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,440
And so we find this evening that he says,

630
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,840
hold fast to keep firm possession of, to keep it secure,

631
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,800
that when you have received the word,

632
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,940
they received it through prophets

633
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,440
that would speak direct revelation of God,

634
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,119
we receive it today through our own personal Bible study,

635
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,000
through preaching, as God has given the responsibility

636
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,080
of evangelists and pastors to preach the word,

637
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,160
we receive it, then we prove it,

638
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,460
go home and search the scriptures,

639
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,440
and then we hold fast, we hold fast.

640
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
It's funny as you look at the,

641
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,480
it's really the word funny

642
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,520
is probably not the appropriate word,

643
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,600
it's of great interest when you talk to folks that wanna,

644
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,080
why aren't you more open-minded

645
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,280
about this than to the other thing?

646
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,960
And you begin to share with them truth,

647
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
and you show them,

648
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,880
here's why I've come to the position that I've come to.

649
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,440
And you can go to verse, after verse,

650
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,119
after verse, after verse,

651
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,540
I mean, that's proving all things.

652
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,640
It's having a biblical foundation.

653
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,679
And it's so imperative that we as the people of God

654
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:56,860
are biblically based.

655
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,619
We notice that this truth that he says, hold fast.

656
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:06,039
that which is good." Notice what he says. I want you to see two passages in

657
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,959
closing this evening. Look back in Philippians chapter 4 if you will, and I

658
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:14,659
want you to see what Paul says to the church at Philippi. In Philippians

659
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:18,219
chapter 4, and then we're gonna look at what Paul says to Timothy, his own

660
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:23,219
son of the faith, and 2nd Timothy. So we'll notice here in Philippians 4

661
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:30,259
what he says to the church at Philippi. Notice in verse number 9 of Philippians

662
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:40,339
4, "...those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen

663
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:49,019
in me do, and the God of peace shall be with you." So Paul is saying to this

664
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,619
church in Philippi that there are some things that you've heard from me. Yes, you

665
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,339
have learned them, you've received them, you've heard them, you've

666
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:02,379
seen them in me. You need to do them, and he talks about the God of peace being

667
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:08,019
with them. This is giving us the idea, the understanding, that when we hold fast

668
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,899
that which is good, it's not just that we have a head knowledge of this is what

669
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:18,939
we believe. No, we also practice what we believe, that we're to be doers of the

670
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:24,859
Word. Amen? Listen, the Bible has been given to us, yes, to help us to

671
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:29,019
establish truth, that which is right, that which is wrong, that which is good,

672
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,899
that which is evil, to understand the plan of God. God's given us so many

673
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,899
wonderful truths in His Word, but understand that He's not given it to us

674
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:42,379
just so that we can have some superior level of knowledge. He's given it to us

675
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:46,819
so that it would impact our behavior, so that it would change the way that we live.

676
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:51,259
And so we find this evening that Paul is mentioning there to the church at

677
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,219
Philippi, but now I want you to see what he says to Timothy in 2nd Timothy

678
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:59,539
chapter 2. Notice what he says in 2nd Timothy chapter 2, and then we'll be

679
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:04,739
done this evening, but notice here, it's a great verse of Scripture that we've

680
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:12,819
often used with regard to the work, the ministry of discipleship. In 2nd Timothy

681
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:18,339
chapter 2, he says, Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ

682
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:26,419
Jesus. Notice verse 2, In the things that thou hast heard of me among many

683
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:35,539
witnesses, the same. Commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach

684
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:42,099
others also. This verse of Scripture gives us the truth of generational

685
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:48,220
influence. It shows to us not only Paul being the one teaching Timothy, but then

686
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:53,379
Timothy investing in others, faithful men that would be able to teach others. We

687
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:57,739
see multiple generations that are covered in verse number 2 of 2nd

688
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:02,059
Timothy chapter 2, but I want you to see this connection here. He says, The

689
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:05,819
things. Do you see it? And the things. That's what he says to begin the verse,

690
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,779
That thou hast heard of me. Now, the things, that's a simple

691
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:17,259
statement that includes a whole lot of teaching, okay? The things that thou hast

692
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:22,059
heard of me among many witnesses. Paul had instructed Timothy. We find the

693
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:27,940
writings that God gives Paul to write to Timothy. Obviously, all Scripture is given

694
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,440
by inspiration of God, but we find that then he says, Notice these words. You see

695
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,860
the things, but then notice this, the same. Do you see them? He says, In the things

696
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:46,000
that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same. Commit thou to

697
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. So when he says the same,

698
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,000
what is he referring to? Would it be a stretch for us to say, The same things

699
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,119
that you learned of me, that's what you're to teach others. That's what he's

700
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:04,199
saying. The same, right? Why? Well, because when we receive the Word and we prove

701
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:12,479
the Word, we hold fast. We hold firm and we teach that same truth to a future

702
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:18,000
generation. We teach that same truth to our children and to our grandchildren

703
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,559
and beyond. Why? Because it is the truth that changes lives. It is this book. God

704
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,720
told us, as we think about it, he says, Thy Word is truth, right? Sanctify them by

705
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,919
thy Word. Thy Word is truth. We find that he tells, Jude gives this charge, that

706
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:42,239
we're to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the

707
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,600
saints. Not that we look for something new. No, we've received already. We have

708
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:56,440
proven and then we hold fast. And when we take that simple formula that's given to

709
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,320
the church in Thessalonica in chapter 5, verses 20 and 21, three statements,

710
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:09,479
despise not prophesying, prove all things, hold fast that which is good, then we are

711
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:18,279
on the way to being sound in the faith. And God wants his individual children and he wants

712
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:28,880
his churches to be sound in the faith. He's given us his Word. He's given us his spirit.

713
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,279
He's equipped the church with pastors and evangelists and given them a charge to preach

714
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:42,919
the Word. And as we receive the Word and we prove through the Word, then we hold fast.

715
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:47,839
Look, I'm thankful that I don't have to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

716
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,519
Amen? It's easy. Listen, I used to, going home from Bible college, I used to listen

717
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,239
to a certain person on the radio the summer of my freshman year in Bible college. And

718
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:04,119
I listened to this fella on the radio try to sharpen myself. He would take calls,

719
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:11,000
Harold Camping, any of you remember him back in the day? And he set dates for the return of Christ

720
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and all kinds of crazy stuff. But I'd listen to him. And here's why I would listen to him,

721
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
because I would try to sharpen myself and he'd begin to give answers. And I'd say,

722
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,919
that's wrong because of this. The Bible says this. I'm driving down the highway and I'm

723
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:28,399
trying to recall verses of scripture that I'm trying to, why? Because I'm trying to be sharp

724
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,279
to understand what does the Bible teach? And sometimes he would deal with certain things

725
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:39,359
and I'd go and have to look it up. And why? I'm trying to prove. And I was trying to do that so

726
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,600
that I could be equipped, so that I could be in a position of being able to defend, earnestly

727
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,399
contend for the faith. We need to be very careful this evening, not looking for anything new.

728
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,839
God's given us all that we need. There are people out there running around trying to find some new

729
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,040
revelation, while at the same time they're not even doing what God has revealed to them in His

730
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,160
Word. What a shame. What a sad situation. This evening, he says, despise not prophesying,

731
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:19,600
prove all things, hold fast that which is good. What a great formula to be sound in the faith.

732
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,760
Let's pray. Lord, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the Word. I pray that

733
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,959
you'd help us to be strengthened. Lord, help us to be settled and grounded. Help us, Lord, to

734
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:34,959
be firm in our position. Help us to be biblical. Bless our time of prayer. We'll thank you for it

735
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:38,799
in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's start in the back with the prayer updates for our

736
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,519
missionaries. Brother Kim, Sermon Lord in China, anyone need a...
