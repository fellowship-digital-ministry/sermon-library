WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.559
She made it back safely on Monday evening.

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:05.579
And so we thank the Lord for that.

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:08.199
And she just has a few more weeks

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.579
and then she'll be done her first year.

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.680
It's hard to believe, but continue to pray for her,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.560
pray for Kiademe.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.120
She also has just a few weeks left

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.280
until she's finished with her first year.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.120
And it's hard to believe how quickly time goes.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.500
And we're thankful that both Kiademe and Brianne

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.340
are doing well.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.840
Thank you for praying for them.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.280
First Thessalonians chapter five this evening,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.360
First Thessalonians chapter number five.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.580
We started in verse number 12 about three months ago now.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.240
And we've been studying through these instructions

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.479
that God gives to the church there in Thessalonica.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.880
And he begins with, we beseech you.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.400
And then of course he transitions in verse 14.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.319
We exhort you and we find that as we've read through

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:54.479
and studied these particular instructions,

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.439
that we would say that the closing section of this book

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.560
is packed with powerful truth.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.000
And I would call it profitable instruction.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.919
We understand that God's word is profitable.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.480
We understand that the second Timothy chapter three

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.959
in verse number 16 tells us that all scripture

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.800
is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.720
It tells us what it's profitable for,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.680
but this is profitable instruction.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
And we find that every New Testament church

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.919
should have a desire to walk worthy and please God.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.599
That of course has been the title for this series

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.000
over the last 13 weeks.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400
And this evening as we examine two verses of scripture,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.599
we've been spending, really in verse 14,

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.879
we spent several weeks looking at each phrase.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.660
And then over the next several weeks,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.199
we've kind of just dealt with one verse per week.

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:46.040
But this evening, verse number 20 and 21

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.580
really tie together and establish a single truth

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.779
that needs to be understood.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.699
And really, I believe that the scriptures are clear

00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.360
that we are to be sound in the faith.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.699
We find that God has desire for his children

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:08.500
and for his churches to be sound in the faith.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.479
That word sound means to be healthy.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.779
It means to be free from any mixture of error.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.820
You will find the phrase there in the book of Titus

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.619
of being sound in the faith.

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.300
You'll find in the book of Titus

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.220
and the book of 1 Timothy

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.399
and a number of other books as well,

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.660
where they'll use the word sound doctrine

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.339
and that which is free of any error, mixture of error.

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.139
And so we find that God desires for his people,

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.720
his churches to be sound in the faith.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.059
As you read the pastoral epistles,

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.979
as you read the letters that are given

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.380
to the New Testament churches,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.699
such as this one to the church at Thessalonica,

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.059
you will know that there is an emphasis placed

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.539
on the importance of being settled, grounded,

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.860
and established in the faith.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.979
And that's what God wants for his people.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.380
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.139
He doesn't want every time some new thing comes up

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.460
for us to be swaying back and forth

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.779
and we're over here and we're over there

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:10.660
and we don't know what.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.179
No, he wants us to be settled and grounded

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.339
and to have that solid foundation.

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.539
And so God provided us with his word

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.860
and we believe the Bible is the sole authority

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.979
for faith and for practice.

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.539
And so I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.220
We understand that the church in Thessalonica

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.300
and many of the churches, as we look at the churches

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.779
that are written to here in the New Testament,

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.339
they did not have the entire Bible

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.059
like we have this evening.

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.940
And so we understand that God,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.619
during that foundational period of time

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.860
that we often refer to as the early church age,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.179
in the first century, that God had established

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.339
that there would be some apostolic sign gifts,

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.660
that there would be some truth

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.899
with regard to some spiritual gifts

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.059
that would be for that era of time.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.779
And we see really that here,

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.100
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.339
that he's dealing with part of that,

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.139
but we find that it's been preserved for us this evening

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.220
and it's applicable for every church

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.100
throughout the church age.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.940
We have the whole Bible and we ought to be thankful for that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.179
and here in these two verses of scripture,

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:27.380
I believe that God provides his people

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.540
with a simple formula that will enable

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.619
individual believers and churches

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:36.700
to be sound in the faith.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.619
Notice what he says in verse number 20,

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:42.540
despise not prophesying, verse 21,

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:47.579
prove all things, hold fast that which is good.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.779
Really, those three statements are going to serve

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.260
as our three points for an outline this evening.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.579
And so number one, verse number 20,

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.700
despise not prophesying,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.100
as I've titled the message this evening,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.739
sound in the faith.

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:04.299
How can we be sound in the faith?

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.260
How could this church, the church in Thessalonica,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.619
how could they be sound in the faith?

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.339
How could any church be sound in the faith?

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.140
Maybe we can ask this question as well this evening.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.540
Are there churches that are not sound in the faith?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.739
Obviously, the answer is obvious to that question.

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.739
There are an abundance of churches

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.540
that are not sound in the faith.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.779
How can we make that statement this evening?

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.859
Well, because what they teach and what they practice

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:37.700
doesn't align with the book that God gave us, the Bible.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.140
And I'm so thankful for that little song that we sing,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.100
so often with the children in Sunday school, the B-I-B-L-E.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.700
Yes, that's the book for me.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.459
I stand alone on the word of God, the B-I-B-L-E.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.980
And God's given us the authoritative word,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.980
and that is certainly reason to rejoice.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.980
But we find first this evening, despise not prophesying.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.859
So we have to understand,

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:04.920
as we look at this verse of scripture,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.820
what is it that Paul is referring to?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.279
What are these prophecies, if you will,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.040
these prophesying that Paul is referring to

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.839
when he says despise not prophesying?

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.320
Well, we have to understand this evening

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.559
the ministry of prophets.

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:22.959
What is the ministry of prophets?

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.600
Well, prior to the New Testament being completed,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.000
we find that prophets would speak

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.140
direct revelation from God.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.920
Now that the Bible is completed,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.000
we find that there are no longer prophets

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.440
in the sense of speaking direct revelation from God.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.480
For the Bible, the canon of scripture is closed.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.600
Now we could look at a preacher and say,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.040
some might use that terminology,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.279
that they're forth telling, they're giving truth.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.799
But the reality is that that office of a prophet,

00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:00.119
when Paul was speaking here about despise not prophesying,

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.920
we must understand what the New Testament teaches us

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.500
about the ministry of prophets.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.140
Understand also this evening that prophets,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.980
apostles and prophets,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.339
were the foundation of the local church.

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.619
We understand that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone.

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:21.140
The prophets and the apostles are the foundation.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.179
And then we find that Peter refers to,

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:24.980
we see in the book of Ephesians as well,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.700
that we are lively stones.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.980
We're like the bricks of the structure of the church,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.019
if we could think about it in that image this evening.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.500
And so look back, if you will, to the book of Ephesians,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.779
and notice what God tells us about prophets.

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.459
And it helps us to understand what Paul is dealing with here

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:45.140
in the church in Thessalonica,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.380
when he says despise not prophesying.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.160
It's Ephesians chapter two.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.100
Look, if you will, with me at verse number 20.

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:56.820
Now, obviously we're jumping at the end

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.940
of a text of scripture,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.220
and he's talked already about their new position in Christ,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.820
because these people have been saved by the grace of God.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.899
And he says this in verse number 20,

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.100
and are built upon the foundation

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.260
of the apostles and prophets,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.

00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:22.380
So Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.459
and the apostles and the prophets,

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:28.220
according to verse 20, are the foundation.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.820
If you look back in verse 19,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.020
he talks about our position in Christ

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.099
and of the household of God.

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.539
And again, seeing in verse 21,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.859
in whom all the building fitly framed together,

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:42.859
groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:44.940
in whom you also are builded together

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.460
for an habitation of God through the spirit.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.419
And so we find this evening in Ephesians 2.20,

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:54.659
this truth that the apostles and the prophets

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.239
are the foundation of the church.

00:08:57.239 --> 00:08:59.979
Look in chapter three, if you will, in verse number five,

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:03.340
the Bible says this, which in other ages,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.260
he's talking about this mystery,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.900
which in other ages was not made known

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.859
unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed

00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:16.859
unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.099
And so this is God's revelation, again,

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:23.580
as we would speak about the ministry of prophets

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.539
before the completion of the New Testament,

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:29.859
that they would speak direct revelation from God.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.900
And so he gives us this truth

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.840
in verse number five of chapter three.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.179
Again, look over in chapter number four, if you will,

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:39.539
in verse number 11, and we really could read down

00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:42.260
a few verses, we'll read verses 11 through 14,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.820
and notice the various offices that are spoken of here.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.739
In Ephesians four, in verse number 11,

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.820
it says, and he gave some apostles.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.900
Now, if you look back in the text, in verses seven and eight,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.539
you talk about the gifts that he's given to every man

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.380
and understand that he here.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.460
is referring to God, he gave some apostles

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.220
and some prophets and some evangelists

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.220
and some pastors and teachers.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.220
So what was the purpose that God gave these offices?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.460
He equipped the church with these offices.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.500
Notice in verse number 12,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.140
for the perfecting of the saints,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.340
for the work of the ministry,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.820
for the edifying of the body of Christ,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.780
till we all come in the unity of the faith

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.700
and with the knowledge of the Son of God

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.060
unto a perfect man,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.900
unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.860
that we, notice this, henceforth,

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.740
be no more children tossed to and fro

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.380
and carried about with every wind of doctrine

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.180
by the slight of men and cunning craftiness,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.420
whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.780
And so understand that false teachers,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.020
they're very subtle in their approach.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.460
Understand that they're lying in wait to deceive.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.040
This is the revelation that God has given us

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.000
with regard to their craftiness.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.580
He says, by the slight of men, every wind of doctrine.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.540
And obviously there were false teachers

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.040
that were prevalent in the early church age,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.580
just as there are today.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.220
We find that in the Old Testament, there were false prophets.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.620
We can read of all of those things.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.660
And so we find that we understand

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.340
prior to the completion of the New Testament,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.700
what was the ministry of a prophet?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.140
Well, to give the word of God,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.100
that direct revelation from God.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.940
So here, Paul is saying, despise not prophesying.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.740
There are gonna be some that come in

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.220
that are going to speak to you the truth.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.620
Despise not prophesying.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.780
We find that it doesn't end there.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.180
We'll look at verse 21 in just a moment.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.620
But let me just say this,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.460
because as we look at this passage of scripture

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.500
and understand that we today are not in the same position

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.860
as the church at Thessalonica.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.100
The church in Thessalonica didn't have a whole Bible.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.060
We have a whole Bible.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.180
So what is the ministry of a prophet?

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.559
Well, apostles and prophets are no more

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:10.500
in the sense that they were

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.620
at the writing of the New Testament.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.260
And so therefore, we find that after the completion

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.220
of the New Testament, here's what the New Testament says.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.980
In 1 Corinthians chapter 13, in fact, turn there,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.660
because I want you to see it.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.419
In verses eight through 10, notice what the Bible says,

00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:28.540
and it deals with tongues as well

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.300
as we read the portion of scripture.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.639
But I want you to see what it says

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.540
with regard to prophecies.

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:38.660
In 1 Corinthians chapter 13, in verse number eight,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.020
of course, many of you know, 1 Corinthians 13,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.240
people refer to it as what?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.820
The love chapter, it's about charity.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.900
And he says in verse number eight, charity never faileth.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.900
But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail.

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:56.660
Do you see that?

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.660
It then goes on, it says whether there be tongues,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.700
they shall cease.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.660
Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.380
for we know in part, and we prophesy in part,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.220
but when that which is perfect is come,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.500
then that which is in part shall be done away.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.460
And we find that as we look here

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.900
and we think about Peter, excuse me, James,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.779
talking about in James chapter number one,

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:22.660
the perfect law of liberty,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.940
and that we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.820
He talks about the one that looks into the mirror

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.300
and he uses that illustration

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.639
and he looks into the perfect law of liberty.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.620
So when the word of God is complete,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.100
as we see in verse number 10,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.059
they didn't have the complete New Testament

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:39.260
or the complete Bible, we now do.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.940
And so he says that these things that are in part

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.820
shall be done away.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.300
Notice in verse number eight,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.860
it says whether there be prophecies,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.460
notice they shall fail.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.360
Now, is that a statement that is absolute?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.980
They shall fail, that's what's going to happen.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.540
What does the word fail mean?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.240
It does not mean that the prophecies

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.840
aren't going to come to pass.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.160
So you think about the Old Testament,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.620
when there's a prophet, if a prophet is known,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.360
whether they're a true prophet or a false prophet

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.020
was whether or not their prophecies came to pass, right?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.419
That was a test that was given of Old Testament prophets.

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.700
This is not what that word fail mean.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.940
It doesn't mean that somebody made a prophecy

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.300
and it did not come to pass, it failed.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.899
No, this word fail means to cause to cease,

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.100
to end or to be done away.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.779
So what is he revealing to us?

00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:34.899
Well, prophecies in the sense of speaking

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:36.820
the direct revelation from God,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.899
as we see prior to the New Testament being completed,

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:42.140
that after the New Testament is completed,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.540
after the Bible is completed, then prophecies shall fail.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.540
They're going to cease.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.140
We don't need them anymore.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.899
God's given us the Bible.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:53.220
He's given us the whole canon of Scripture

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.860
and therefore no one is speaking

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.100
any direct revelation from God.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.100
God has given his complete revelation in his word.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.059
Does that make sense this evening?

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:06.940
So then he says, whether they be tongues, they shall cease.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.300
I just had this conversation

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.980
at the dinner table this evening.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.020
Somebody came up with, somebody sent a note to Juliana

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.220
about some speaking tongues situation.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.300
We began to talk about it.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.660
And I said, the question that people have to answer

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.520
is that the Bible says they shall cease.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.260
When?

00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:27.660
When, when are they gonna cease?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.300
Well, according to the text, as you read through the text,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.980
when that which is perfect is come,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.179
that's when they're going to cease.

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:38.940
So we look here and we find, again, there are people today,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.380
there are groups of churches you can go to

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.899
that still would believe in prophecies

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:46.200
and they would believe in speaking in tongues

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.580
and yet they don't follow the biblical pattern

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.380
or the biblical instruction that's been given.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.660
And we find here this evening that God is very clear

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.940
in his word, as we can go Scripture with Scripture,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.540
comparing Scripture with Scripture,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.260
what it is that they had the responsibility of receiving

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.300
and how for every church throughout the church age,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.559
how we would deal with this.

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:10.899
Again, they did not have a complete Bible,

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:13.820
so therefore God was still giving his word

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.380
through prophecies, through prophesying,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.020
as we would see in this text of Scripture.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.100
Therefore, as we look at ourselves today

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.380
as a New Testament church

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.380
and looking at having the complete canon of Scripture,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.380
we do not need any office of a prophet.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.100
There's no longer prophesying in that sense.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.100
Absolutely, it is true today that God still uses evangelists

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.339
and pastors to preach his word.

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:47.540
That's why Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.739
preach the word.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:52.020
That's why we find that as you look at the entirety

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.260
of Ephesians 4, verse number 11,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.179
he talks about apostles, prophets, evangelists,

00:16:58.179 --> 00:16:59.860
pastors and teachers.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.700
And we see again that the foundation of the church

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.940
was laid Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.779
the foundation, the apostles and the prophets.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:13.200
And so we find that the first thing that is given

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.619
to the church in Thessalonica is despise not prophesying.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.779
If I could look at that and try to apply it

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:21.279
for us this evening,

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.980
I would say that when the word of God is being preached,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.839
we ought not despise it.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.980
We ought to accept the truth of God's word.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.920
And in fact, we ought to desire to hear the word of God

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.760
being proclaimed.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.580
We ought to make sure that we're in a place

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.140
where the word of God is being proclaimed.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.179
We don't go somewhere, we don't go find a church

00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:45.559
based on wanting to know what kind of ministries

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:48.179
or programs do you have and what do you have for this

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:49.179
and what do you have for that

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:51.619
and where do you take the teenagers during the summer

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:53.020
and this, that and the other thing.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.420
And there's a lot of people that that's what they look for

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.059
in finding a church.

00:17:58.059 --> 00:18:01.899
And they don't really have as a primary factor

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:06.980
how the preaching is handled.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.940
But I would say that first and foremost,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.020
we better be concerned with the preaching of God's word

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.020
and we should despise not the preaching,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.980
despise not prophesying is what he says

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.660
to the church in Thessalonica.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.739
Now notice as we move on verse 21,

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:22.020
number two, if you're taking notes,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.779
he says prove all things, prove all things.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.339
What does it mean to prove?

00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:30.580
It means to test or to examine.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.400
It means to scrutinize.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.340
It means to determine if a thing is genuine.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.099
All right, so that's what the word means, prove.

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:44.619
So here he says prove all things.

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:47.419
So I want you to think about the church in Thessalonica

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:50.820
and I want you to think about this despise not prophesying.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.099
But there are false prophets, there are false teachers.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.940
So when somebody is coming and they say,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.140
I have a prophecy from the Lord, I'm gonna prophesy.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.179
All right, despise not prophesying

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:07.179
but coupled together prove all things.

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:10.500
And so how is it that we today

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.179
are going to prove all things?

00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:15.059
How is it that they could prove all things?

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:17.580
Well, we find that they obviously

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.700
had the apostolic authority of Paul and Peter and John

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.859
and so on and so forth.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:25.380
But we noticed something in the church at Berea.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.739
So look over at Acts chapter 17, if you will.

00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:31.220
And we often reference the Bereans.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.140
And we talk about the behavior of the Bereans

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.140
when it came to Paul going there and preaching the word.

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:44.299
Now we find that here Paul was only there

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:46.460
for a very short time.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.559
In fact, he went to Berea because

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:52.179
of being run out of Thessalonica.

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:54.780
And that's where the chapter begins in Thessalonica

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.059
and then he's run out of there

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:59.059
because of all of the turmoil and opposition.

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:00.460
It says in verse number 10.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.520
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.920
by night unto Berea, who coming thither

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.800
went into the synagogue of the Jews.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800
Isn't that awesome?

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.240
Paul was so concerned, everywhere he went

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.480
to preach the truth of the gospel, to let it be known,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.200
and so he finds himself being carried over to Berea

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.520
because of the opposition in Thessalonica,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.680
and he goes into the synagogue of the Jews,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.080
and he goes in to teach and to preach.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.380
We find that in verse number two,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.280
it says this was his manner,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.080
and he reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.320
and so look in verse number 11,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.320
the Bible says these, those in Berea,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.780
these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.000
in that they received the word,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.920
notice what it says, with all readiness of mind.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.160
But notice, and searched the scriptures daily

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.000
for what purpose, whether those things were so.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.640
So Paul comes and he's reasoning with them

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.560
out of the scriptures, this is his manner

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.040
according to verses two and three,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.280
when he gets to Thessalonica,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.680
so we could easily assume, and I think properly assume,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.040
that when he gets into Thessalonica,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.480
he does the same thing.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.160
And so in verse number three of the text,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.240
it says, opening and alleging that Christ must needs

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.560
have suffered and risen again from the dead,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.080
and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.080
And so I believe that Paul went to Berea

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.200
with the same message, and so they received the word

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.640
with all readiness of mind.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.160
They weren't despising prophecies, prophesying,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.320
and so they received the word with all readiness of mind,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.680
but then it says they searched the scriptures daily

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.520
whether these things were so.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.800
How do we prove all things?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.920
How could the church in Thessalonica prove all things?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.480
Well, they did have the Old Testament,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.560
and they were able to go,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.260
and they were able to prove all things.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.500
Of course, the apostolic authority,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.000
as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.340
but then I want you to think about

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.900
the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.100
Now, again, we have the whole canon of scripture,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.620
and what a blessing that is,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.900
but we understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.080
The Bible tells us in the Gospel of John

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.300
that he will guide us into all truth,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.460
lead us into all truth.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.100
That's a ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.060
and I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.220
at the moment of salvation, indwells every believer.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.220
Those that were saved in Thessalonica

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.900
when they got saved,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.800
they got the Holy Spirit just like we do.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.900
So the Holy Spirit of God lives within them.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.780
Have you ever heard something or read something

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.340
and just something didn't sit right with you,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.460
and you didn't really know what it was?

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.980
Is the Holy Spirit not,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.420
the Holy Spirit was not confirming what you were hearing.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.820
Has that ever happened?

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.200
You start reading the wrong book,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.220
you start listening to the wrong person on YouTube

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.340
or wherever it might be,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.220
and all of a sudden something's being said,

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.340
there's some kind of, and you're like,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.220
eh, something's not right here.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.160
The Holy Spirit's giving you this uneasy feeling

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.260
that there's just not something right.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.900
And then you go to the Scriptures and you trust the Lord

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.280
and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.460
as he promises to do so.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.100
Again, John 14 and verse number 26,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.060
the Bible says this in that portion of Scripture,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.300
"'But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.000
"'whom the Father will send in my name,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.540
"'he shall teach you all things

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.980
"'and bring all things to your remembrance,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.420
"'whatsoever I have said unto you.'"

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.820
And then in chapter 15, excuse me,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.100
chapter 16 and verse number 13,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.060
the Bible says this,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.980
"'Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come,

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.460
"'he will guide you into all truth,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.940
"'for he shall not speak of himself,

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.600
"'but whatsoever he shall hear,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.640
"'that shall he speak,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.820
"'and he will show you things to come.'"

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.660
And so we have those promises from Jesus

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.300
with regard to the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.600
And so as the people of God today,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.740
when we look at this admonition,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.460
this really, if you think about it,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.500
as I mentioned already,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.500
this formula for how an individual believer or a church

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.600
could be sound in the faith,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.280
we are to prove all things.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.020
Go to the Bible and ask the Holy Spirit

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.220
to commune with your spirit.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.260
Look over at 1 John chapter four,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.220
and I'm gonna read all of the verses

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.100
where I've actually turned there.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.540
I just referenced John 14 and 16,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.040
but look at 1 John chapter four, if you will.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.940
In 1 John chapter number four,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.340
notice how we begin this chapter.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.340
It says, "'Beloved, believe not every spirit.'"

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.220
But what's the admonition?

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.220
"'But try the spirits, whether they are of God.'"

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.420
Because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.780
Did God know that there would be false teachers

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.700
and false prophets?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.540
Sure He did.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.840
So what did He do?

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.660
Well, He gave warning and instruction to His people

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.660
on how they are to try the spirits and prove all things.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.360
And so He tells them in verse number two,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.740
"'Hereby know ye the Spirit of God,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.360
"'every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.000
"'has come in the flesh is of God.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.960
"'And every spirit that confesseth not

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.080
"'that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.680
"'And this is that spirit of antichrist,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.740
"'whereof ye have heard that it should come,

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.120
"'and even now already is it in the world.'"

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.800
Now, we know that one day during the tribulation

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.240
that the antichrist is going to show up,

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.160
but the spirit of antichrist is already working.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.800
We see that, we know here it's already in the world.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.720
And then He says, "'Ye are of God, little children,

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.560
"'and have overcome them, because greater is he

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.980
"'that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.080
"'They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.860
"'and the world heareth them.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.500
"'We are of God.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.480
"'He that knoweth God heareth us,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.600
"'he that is not of God heareth not us.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.180
"'Hereby know we the spirit of truth

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.080
"'and the spirit of error.'"

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.040
This simple statement in verse number 21,

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.360
prove all things, it reminds us of the importance

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.360
of knowing the word of God and walking in the spirit.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.640
Listen, there's a lot of stuff out there today.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.920
There's a lot of preachers on the internet.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.440
I'm not gonna suggest that every one of them is wrong,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.600
because there's some good ones out there.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.880
But I'm telling you, prove all things.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.880
That's what the Bible tells us

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.080
as part of the formula.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.160
Listen, there's a lot of books out there,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.840
a lot of books that you can get your hands on,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.960
and sometimes those books have false teaching in them.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.200
There might be a couple of good things,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.840
but then there's some bad things in them,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.640
and you gotta be really careful to prove all things.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.640
What does the Bible say?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.520
We gotta know the word.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.100
And so Paul says, if we're going to be sound in the faith,

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.520
and that's the goal, then we must despise not prophesying,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.120
prove all things, and then notice how he ends verse 21,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.080
hold fast that which is good.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.720
Now, when we see that word hold fast,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.920
it means to keep secure, or to keep possession of.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.880
And you think about keeping possession,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.800
keeping firm possession of something.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.880
He says, hold fast that which is good.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.880
So once you have received, and once you have proven,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.460
then hold fast.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.160
I've had people ask me before, are you open-minded?

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.120
Well, I can only be as open-minded

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.160
as God's word allows me to be, amen?

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.240
Listen, I'm not open-minded

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.080
that there's another way to heaven, amen?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.120
And people can say, oh, you're closed-minded,

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.560
you're narrow, you're this, you're that.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.720
Listen, the Bible says that Jesus is the only way,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.200
does it not?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.480
And so once we have received the word,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.060
and once we have proved, then we hold fast.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.760
You know, so many people today are saying,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.500
we should change, we need to change this and change that,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.960
and become more accommodating, and try to,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.240
listen, we gotta hold fast to the truth.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.440
What truth of God's word are you willing to let go of?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.440
I don't wanna let go of any of it,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.640
because God gave it to us

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.080
so that we could walk worthy and please him, amen?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.440
And so we find this evening that he says,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.840
hold fast to keep firm possession of, to keep it secure,

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.800
that when you have received the word,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.940
they received it through prophets

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.440
that would speak direct revelation of God,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.119
we receive it today through our own personal Bible study,

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:07.000
through preaching, as God has given the responsibility

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.080
of evangelists and pastors to preach the word,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.160
we receive it, then we prove it,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.460
go home and search the scriptures,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.440
and then we hold fast, we hold fast.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.440
It's funny as you look at the,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.480
it's really the word funny

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.520
is probably not the appropriate word,

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.600
it's of great interest when you talk to folks that wanna,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.080
why aren't you more open-minded

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.280
about this than to the other thing?

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.960
And you begin to share with them truth,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.160
and you show them,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.880
here's why I've come to the position that I've come to.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.440
And you can go to verse, after verse,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.119
after verse, after verse,

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:46.540
I mean, that's proving all things.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.640
It's having a biblical foundation.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.679
And it's so imperative that we as the people of God

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:56.860
are biblically based.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.619
We notice that this truth that he says, hold fast.

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:06.039
that which is good." Notice what he says. I want you to see two passages in

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:09.959
closing this evening. Look back in Philippians chapter 4 if you will, and I

00:30:09.959 --> 00:30:14.659
want you to see what Paul says to the church at Philippi. In Philippians

00:30:14.659 --> 00:30:18.219
chapter 4, and then we're gonna look at what Paul says to Timothy, his own

00:30:18.219 --> 00:30:23.219
son of the faith, and 2nd Timothy. So we'll notice here in Philippians 4

00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:30.259
what he says to the church at Philippi. Notice in verse number 9 of Philippians

00:30:30.259 --> 00:30:40.339
4, "...those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:49.019
in me do, and the God of peace shall be with you." So Paul is saying to this

00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:53.619
church in Philippi that there are some things that you've heard from me. Yes, you

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:57.339
have learned them, you've received them, you've heard them, you've

00:30:57.339 --> 00:31:02.379
seen them in me. You need to do them, and he talks about the God of peace being

00:31:02.379 --> 00:31:08.019
with them. This is giving us the idea, the understanding, that when we hold fast

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:12.899
that which is good, it's not just that we have a head knowledge of this is what

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:18.939
we believe. No, we also practice what we believe, that we're to be doers of the

00:31:18.939 --> 00:31:24.859
Word. Amen? Listen, the Bible has been given to us, yes, to help us to

00:31:24.859 --> 00:31:29.019
establish truth, that which is right, that which is wrong, that which is good,

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:33.899
that which is evil, to understand the plan of God. God's given us so many

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.899
wonderful truths in His Word, but understand that He's not given it to us

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:42.379
just so that we can have some superior level of knowledge. He's given it to us

00:31:42.379 --> 00:31:46.819
so that it would impact our behavior, so that it would change the way that we live.

00:31:46.819 --> 00:31:51.259
And so we find this evening that Paul is mentioning there to the church at

00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:54.219
Philippi, but now I want you to see what he says to Timothy in 2nd Timothy

00:31:54.219 --> 00:31:59.539
chapter 2. Notice what he says in 2nd Timothy chapter 2, and then we'll be

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:04.739
done this evening, but notice here, it's a great verse of Scripture that we've

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:12.819
often used with regard to the work, the ministry of discipleship. In 2nd Timothy

00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:18.339
chapter 2, he says, Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ

00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:26.419
Jesus. Notice verse 2, In the things that thou hast heard of me among many

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:35.539
witnesses, the same. Commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach

00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:42.099
others also. This verse of Scripture gives us the truth of generational

00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:48.220
influence. It shows to us not only Paul being the one teaching Timothy, but then

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:53.379
Timothy investing in others, faithful men that would be able to teach others. We

00:32:53.379 --> 00:32:57.739
see multiple generations that are covered in verse number 2 of 2nd

00:32:57.739 --> 00:33:02.059
Timothy chapter 2, but I want you to see this connection here. He says, The

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:05.819
things. Do you see it? And the things. That's what he says to begin the verse,

00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:11.779
That thou hast heard of me. Now, the things, that's a simple

00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:17.259
statement that includes a whole lot of teaching, okay? The things that thou hast

00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:22.059
heard of me among many witnesses. Paul had instructed Timothy. We find the

00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:27.940
writings that God gives Paul to write to Timothy. Obviously, all Scripture is given

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.440
by inspiration of God, but we find that then he says, Notice these words. You see

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:39.860
the things, but then notice this, the same. Do you see them? He says, In the things

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:46.000
that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same. Commit thou to

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.679
faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. So when he says the same,

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:54.000
what is he referring to? Would it be a stretch for us to say, The same things

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.119
that you learned of me, that's what you're to teach others. That's what he's

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:04.199
saying. The same, right? Why? Well, because when we receive the Word and we prove

00:34:04.199 --> 00:34:12.479
the Word, we hold fast. We hold firm and we teach that same truth to a future

00:34:12.479 --> 00:34:18.000
generation. We teach that same truth to our children and to our grandchildren

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.559
and beyond. Why? Because it is the truth that changes lives. It is this book. God

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:30.720
told us, as we think about it, he says, Thy Word is truth, right? Sanctify them by

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:36.919
thy Word. Thy Word is truth. We find that he tells, Jude gives this charge, that

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:42.239
we're to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:48.600
saints. Not that we look for something new. No, we've received already. We have

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:56.440
proven and then we hold fast. And when we take that simple formula that's given to

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.320
the church in Thessalonica in chapter 5, verses 20 and 21, three statements,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:09.479
despise not prophesying, prove all things, hold fast that which is good, then we are

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:18.279
on the way to being sound in the faith. And God wants his individual children and he wants

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:28.880
his churches to be sound in the faith. He's given us his Word. He's given us his spirit.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.279
He's equipped the church with pastors and evangelists and given them a charge to preach

00:35:34.279 --> 00:35:42.919
the Word. And as we receive the Word and we prove through the Word, then we hold fast.

00:35:42.919 --> 00:35:47.839
Look, I'm thankful that I don't have to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:53.519
Amen? It's easy. Listen, I used to, going home from Bible college, I used to listen

00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:59.239
to a certain person on the radio the summer of my freshman year in Bible college. And

00:35:59.239 --> 00:36:04.119
I listened to this fella on the radio try to sharpen myself. He would take calls,

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:11.000
Harold Camping, any of you remember him back in the day? And he set dates for the return of Christ

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
and all kinds of crazy stuff. But I'd listen to him. And here's why I would listen to him,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.600
because I would try to sharpen myself and he'd begin to give answers. And I'd say,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.919
that's wrong because of this. The Bible says this. I'm driving down the highway and I'm

00:36:23.919 --> 00:36:28.399
trying to recall verses of scripture that I'm trying to, why? Because I'm trying to be sharp

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.279
to understand what does the Bible teach? And sometimes he would deal with certain things

00:36:33.279 --> 00:36:39.359
and I'd go and have to look it up. And why? I'm trying to prove. And I was trying to do that so

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:45.600
that I could be equipped, so that I could be in a position of being able to defend, earnestly

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:52.399
contend for the faith. We need to be very careful this evening, not looking for anything new.

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:57.839
God's given us all that we need. There are people out there running around trying to find some new

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:03.040
revelation, while at the same time they're not even doing what God has revealed to them in His

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:10.160
Word. What a shame. What a sad situation. This evening, he says, despise not prophesying,

00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:19.600
prove all things, hold fast that which is good. What a great formula to be sound in the faith.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.760
Let's pray. Lord, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the Word. I pray that

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.959
you'd help us to be strengthened. Lord, help us to be settled and grounded. Help us, Lord, to

00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:34.959
be firm in our position. Help us to be biblical. Bless our time of prayer. We'll thank you for it

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:38.799
in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's start in the back with the prayer updates for our

00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:41.519
missionaries. Brother Kim, Sermon Lord in China, anyone need a...
