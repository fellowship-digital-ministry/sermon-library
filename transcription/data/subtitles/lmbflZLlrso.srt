1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
feeling well today, and so you pray for Norma Jean,

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,800
and then pray for Miss Mauna as well.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,639
I don't know, she's normally here,

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,039
and so she's not here this evening.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,800
We'll follow up and see if she's doing well,

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,840
but I would like for you to pray for Miss Mauna as well,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,879
and we're thankful to the Lord for the privilege of prayer.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,040
The book of Ephesians this evening,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,719
Ephesians chapter number six,

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,659
and we have now for a number of weeks here

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,520
on Wednesday evenings have had the opportunity

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,959
to study this subject matter of doing what we ought to do.

13
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,139
Doing what we ought to do,

14
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,360
and as we've had this opportunity

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,479
to study these passages of scripture in the New Testament

16
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,040
that speak about the things that we ought to do,

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,319
we understand that God has given us this truth,

18
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,439
and we ought to apply it in our lives.

19
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,240
Knowing what we ought to do

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,119
doesn't immediately make it the case

21
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,759
that we do what we ought to do,

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,439
and so as we study through these things,

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,639
we wanna be challenged and allow the Lord

24
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,440
to have his will and way in our lives.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,720
I find it fascinating and insightful

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,379
to read Paul's request for prayer

27
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:14,779
as it's recorded here in Ephesians chapter number six.

28
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:18,239
Previously in this book as he's writing to this church

29
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,860
that God allowed him to have an opportunity

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,160
to minister to these precious souls for a number of years,

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,040
and the ministry there and the opportunity

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,639
to be able to influence them,

33
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,559
and he encouraged them previously in the book of Ephesians

34
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:38,239
by revealing to them how he was praying for them,

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,099
and he doesn't just simply say I'm praying for you,

36
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,160
but he explains to them on two separate occasions

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,239
here in the book of Ephesians

38
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,019
how specifically he is praying for them,

39
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,839
and I'm sure that was of great encouragement

40
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:57,000
to the believers when they received this letter

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,199
and they understood how the apostle Paul

42
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,819
was praying for them.

43
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,000
Now as we come to the last part of the chapter of the book

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,199
in Ephesians six verses 19 and 20,

45
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:10,039
Paul makes a request for prayer,

46
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,600
and again, it's fascinating and insightful

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,360
as you read his request that is given

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,759
to the believers at Ephesus.

49
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,119
Notice in verse 19, he says, and for me.

50
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,520
Now he mentions in verse 18 about prayer

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,899
and the subject is dealing with praying for all the saints,

52
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:27,779
but then in verse 19, he says, and for me,

53
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:31,139
and so he's gonna deal with the specific prayer request

54
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,259
that he is submitting, if you will,

55
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,300
to the believers at the church at Ephesus.

56
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,619
Notice as we think about this

57
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,740
that there are times in which we submit prayer requests.

58
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,300
We have a prayer bulletin weekly,

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,039
and Holly updates that,

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,139
and sometimes you give a prayer request

61
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,220
verbally in the service

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,740
as we have the concluding part of our service for prayer,

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,100
and you say would you pray for so on and so forth,

64
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,740
and whatever that request is,

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,619
you can make the request in writing,

66
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,039
you can send an email,

67
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,500
you can send a text, and you give that request,

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,100
and we understand, and now Paul,

69
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,259
as he's writing to these believers in Ephesus

70
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:10,059
here in Ephesians 6, he says, and for me in verse 19,

71
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,339
so he's going to give them

72
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,179
a specific personal request for prayer,

73
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,619
that utterance may be given unto me

74
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,679
that I may open my mouth boldly

75
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:26,779
to make known the mystery of the gospel.

76
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:30,160
So in verse number 19, he gives the truth

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,320
with regard to what he's asking prayer for,

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,039
and he says that utterance may be given unto me,

79
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,360
and then notice that I may open my mouth boldly,

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,279
but not just to say anything,

81
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,639
not just to have boldness to speak

82
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,600
on whatever platform that he's desiring,

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,119
whatever soapbox, if you will,

84
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
that he's desiring to speak on,

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,000
whatever cause it is that he's trying to promote,

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,759
no, that I may open my mouth boldly

87
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,399
for what purpose to make known

88
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,279
the mystery of the gospel.

89
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,279
Notice in verse 20, for which I am an ambassador in bonds,

90
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,360
that therein I may speak boldly,

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
and then here's the statement, as I ought to speak.

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
And so we find that the apostle Paul

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,200
has this understanding that he ought

94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,239
to speak the gospel with boldness.

95
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,959
I've titled the message tonight,

96
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,160
if you're taking notes,

97
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,420
that we ought to proclaim the gospel.

98
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,540
We ought to proclaim the gospel.

99
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,239
As I consider just the opening thoughts

100
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:44,140
of Paul making this request to these believers in Ephesus

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,320
and the way in which I stated

102
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,040
that it's both fascinating and insightful

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,600
to read how Paul is praying for them,

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,480
but also how he requests prayer,

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,640
it leads me to a place of being mindful

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,279
of the fact that we ought to analyze our prayer list.

107
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,480
We ought to analyze what it is that we're praying for.

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,480
What significance of things are we praying for?

109
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,299
What plane, if you will,

110
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:15,440
are there more temporally focused or eternally focused?

111
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
And as we analyze our prayer list,

112
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,279
and also not only analyzing our prayer list,

113
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,720
but reviewing what we request prayer for,

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,399
we find that there really is anything

115
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,880
that Paul could have submitted here

116
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,440
to the church at Ephesus for prayer,

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,579
but he asks specifically that he would be given,

118
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,600
that they would pray that he would be given this boldness

119
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,320
to be able to speak the gospel.

120
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,160
Why?

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,640
Because he knows that he ought to be speaking the gospel.

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,239
Now, this is always an interesting passage of scripture

123
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,760
to me here in Ephesians 6, verses 19 and 20,

124
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,239
because honestly, as I read the New Testament,

125
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:55,040
and as I analyze the life of the Apostle Paul,

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,839
he is a man that is probably the most active proclaimer

127
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,040
of the gospel in the New Testament.

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
He's the one that's traveling from place to place

129
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,279
on these missionary journeys,

130
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,359
and he's proclaiming the gospel,

131
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,799
he's making known Christ,

132
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:14,160
he's sent over to Athens in order to get some rest,

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,779
if you will, because of all the things

134
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,500
that have transpired, and there, as he sees a city

135
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,899
that's wholly given to idolatry, what does he do?

136
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,760
He's stirred, and he goes,

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,739
and he seeks to make Christ known to them,

138
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,380
and we find that Paul was extremely active.

139
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,779
In fact, think about what Paul says in Acts chapter number 20

140
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,420
as he's writing or speaking to these leaders

141
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,140
of the church at Ephesus.

142
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,339
In Acts chapter number 20,

143
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,859
he's had the leaders of the church at Ephesus

144
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:47,179
meet him as he's on his way to Jerusalem,

145
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,059
and as they meet there in Acts chapter number 20,

146
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,179
he imparts to them some important things.

147
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,100
We won't look at the entirety.

148
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,859
We're gonna zero in on one particular statement

149
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:01,339
that he makes with regard to the subject this evening

150
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,540
of we ought to proclaim the gospel,

151
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,779
and notice what he says in verse number 31.

152
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,980
Therefore, watch and remember,

153
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,880
and so there's something that Paul did

154
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,359
that he's calling to their remembrance

155
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:17,519
that by the space of three years,

156
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,519
I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

157
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,079
So Paul, as we look in Acts chapter 20,

158
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,320
his testimony is such, especially with the testimony

159
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,760
that he has with the believers in Ephesus,

160
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,760
that he ceased not to warn for a period of three years.

161
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,559
What is the warning?

162
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,959
Well, it's giving the gospel.

163
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,200
He's warning them about judgment to come

164
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,440
and about the need to trust Christ,

165
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,119
and he says that he was doing it with tears.

166
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:55,100
Notice he says night and day with tears.

167
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,000
So the apostle Paul had an understanding.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,380
His understanding was that he ought

169
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,320
to speak boldly the gospel.

170
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,959
Why is it, what is it that he understood about God

171
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,480
and about God's plan that led him to having this belief

172
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,119
that he ought to speak the gospel,

173
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:20,480
to proclaim the gospel with boldness?

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,519
Well, let me give you just a couple of thoughts

175
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,339
this evening.

176
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,920
If you're taking notes, number one,

177
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,279
I believe the apostle Paul understood the command of Christ,

178
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,239
the command of Christ.

179
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,559
You say, yeah, we know this.

180
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:34,000
We can rehearse the great commission.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Can I say this?

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,280
And with all sincerity,

183
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,719
knowing the great commission isn't the same

184
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,280
as fulfilling the great commission, amen?

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,880
Knowing, again, what I said,

186
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,479
as we've looked at this series here on Wednesday night,

187
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:50,340
knowing what we ought to do doesn't mean

188
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,440
we're actually doing what we ought to do.

189
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,880
And so the ability for us to quote the great commission,

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,039
to know the places within God's word

191
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,559
where the great commission is contained

192
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,559
does not mean that we personally are actively speaking,

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,840
proclaiming the gospel as we ought to be.

194
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,260
We find that there's, of course, the gospel,

195
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,880
the great commission is given in each book of the gospels,

196
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

197
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,419
It's given in the book of Acts as well.

198
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,200
Probably the simplest form,

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,200
the one that is most widely memorized is Mark 16 and 15,

200
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,840
and we're to preach the gospel to every creature.

201
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,640
And we understand that.

202
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,239
We understand this evening the importance

203
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,140
of that portion of scripture and the simplicity

204
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,599
with regard to what Jesus says there.

205
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:48,320
And of course, he says it in different ways

206
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
in each of the gospels as is recorded for us,

207
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,960
but he says that we're to go into all the world

208
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,340
and preach the gospel to every creature.

209
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,119
Now, going into all the world starts

210
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,840
by just going across the street.

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,340
Is it not true?

212
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,080
I was speaking with someone yesterday

213
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,820
that was a freshman there at the college.

214
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,460
In fact, as we were in the hotel

215
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,420
and I was down and had some breakfast

216
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,820
and there weren't too many people down there

217
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,700
and a young man comes and he asked

218
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,840
if the seat was available and he sat there

219
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,520
and he opened his Bible and so I kind of assumed

220
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,340
that maybe he was preparing to go to the college

221
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,900
because he sat down and opened his Bible

222
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,420
and he was of that age and I inquired

223
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,600
and sure enough he's going to be studying

224
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,080
and he began to ask me questions and what have you

225
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,400
and I was sharing with him and I can't give you

226
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,820
all the details, it would take too long,

227
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,280
but the reality is one of the statements

228
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,560
that I made to him is that where we have

229
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
the privilege of ministering here in Northern Virginia

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,360
that literally the world is in our backyard

231
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,740
and we see that, we understand that,

232
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,000
we see how that the opportunities are before us

233
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,800
and truly sharing the gospel, proclaiming the gospel

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,720
begins by simply taking that step

235
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,400
and engaging with an individual.

236
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,080
You don't have to cross an ocean,

237
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,180
you don't have to get on an airplane or a boat

238
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,280
in order to go and proclaim the gospel to someone.

239
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Acts 1.8, but you shall receive power

240
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,560
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you

241
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,120
and you shall be witnesses unto me

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,960
both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

243
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
the uttermost part of the earth

244
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
and remember the disciple said this,

245
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,300
we are his witnesses.

246
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,480
We have it, that portion of Acts 5

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,520
is on the wall above our track rack

248
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,200
to remind us that we are his witnesses

249
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
and if we have the truth and I believe we do,

250
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,780
listen, if I didn't think it was true,

251
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,640
I'd just go do something different, right,

252
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,200
but I believe it's true and we have it

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,160
and therefore we ought to give it.

254
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,200
I want you to consider the life of Paul though

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,240
when we consider the command of Christ,

256
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,840
notice if you will over in Acts 26.

257
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
Notice what he's saying here,

258
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,680
he's standing before King Agrippa

259
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,280
in this closing section of the book of Acts,

260
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,540
we find that Paul has given his testimony

261
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,120
before several leaders and here he's standing

262
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,960
before Agrippa and others that are there,

263
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,520
Festus is going to tell him that he's crazy,

264
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,980
he's mad because he's there in the audience as well,

265
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,960
but notice in Acts 26 and verse 15,

266
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,720
the Apostle Paul is rehearsing his conversion testimony

267
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,260
and his experience of coming to Christ

268
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,120
as we read of it in Acts chapter nine

269
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
and I'm gonna pick it up in verse 15,

270
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,440
he says and I said, who art thou Lord?

271
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,760
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.

272
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,640
But then notice verse 16, but rise and stand upon thy feet

273
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,040
for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose,

274
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,960
to make thee a minister and a witness

275
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,720
both of these things which thou hast seen

276
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,200
and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee,

277
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,640
delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles

278
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,800
unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes

279
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,720
and to turn them from darkness to light

280
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,400
and from the power of Satan unto God

281
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,260
that they may receive forgiveness of sins

282
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,400
and inheritance among them,

283
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,440
which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

284
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,120
Isn't that a great mission that God communicated

285
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,880
to the Apostle Paul at this time in his life,

286
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,920
he saw, he's just converted, he says, who art thou Lord?

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,680
What wilt thou have me to do?

288
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,480
And we find that Jesus gives him this revelation,

289
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
he tells him that he's gonna send him

290
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
as a witness of these things.

291
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
He tells them that as he goes and he preaches,

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
it's going to be so that their eyes,

293
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
that they could be turned from darkness to light,

294
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,220
from the power of Satan unto God,

295
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,000
that they may receive forgiveness of sins.

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,080
This is what we get to do when we proclaim the gospel,

297
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,920
this is what we're doing,

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
we're giving somebody the greatest news.

299
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
I understand that sometimes they don't receive it that way,

300
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,040
but Paul understood this,

301
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
he understood the command of Christ.

302
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
I want you to notice, I stopped reading in verse 18,

303
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
but I want you to look at what it says in Acts 26,

304
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,840
in verse 19, look at what Paul says,

305
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,080
whereupon, O King Agrippa, notice what he says,

306
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Paul considered this thought and this practice

308
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,280
of proclaiming the gospel a matter of obedience,

309
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,640
obedience to Christ, and he says to Agrippa,

310
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.

311
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,280
He says it this way to the church in Corinth

312
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,400
in 1 Corinthians chapter nine,

313
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,320
he's speaking to them about the privilege

314
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,800
that he has to be involved in the gospel ministry,

315
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,040
and he says this in 1 Corinthians nine in verse 16,

316
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,160
for though I preach the gospel,

317
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
I have nothing to glory of,

318
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,560
for necessity is laid upon me, yea,

319
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,920
woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.

320
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,280
And he says in verse 23, and this I do for the gospel's sake

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,680
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

322
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,080
I think about the apostle Paul

323
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,040
and a man that surrendered and yielded

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,960
to proclaiming the gospel,

325
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,040
but yet a man that when he submits a request for prayer

326
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,720
to the church at Ephesus,

327
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,480
what is it that he requests prayer for?

328
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,720
That he would have boldness,

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,800
that he would open his mouth to speak with boldness

330
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,240
as he ought to speak.

331
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Wow.

332
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
He understood the command of Christ.

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Not only do I believe that the apostle Paul

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,040
understood the command of Christ,

335
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,880
number two, I believe that the apostle Paul

336
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,720
understood the certainty of eternity.

337
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
See, for us this evening,

338
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
if we're going to come to this place

339
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,800
that we would preach and proclaim the gospel as we ought to,

340
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,440
that we would say as the apostle Paul

341
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
that I may open my mouth boldly

342
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,440
to make known the mystery of the gospel,

343
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,000
that I would speak as I ought to speak,

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,400
that we understand the command of Christ,

345
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,960
but we also must understand the certainty of eternity.

346
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,040
The wise man said in Ecclesiastes 12 in verse number five

347
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
that man goes to his long home.

348
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
I shared with someone recently,

349
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,080
and I said, listen, no matter how many years we live

350
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
here upon this earth,

351
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,200
it's really only that long in light of eternity.

352
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,400
We sometimes think about, oh man, 70, 80, 90, 100 years,

353
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,400
it's such a long time, not compared to eternity.

354
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,320
It's just that long.

355
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
What is your life?

356
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,920
It's but a vapor that appears for a little time

357
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,120
and then vanisheth away.

358
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
It's like a shadow.

359
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,240
How long does your shadow stick around?

360
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
Not long, not long.

361
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
And so we find that the wise man,

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
he says that man goes to his long home.

363
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,560
Hebrews nine in verse 17 says,

364
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,120
as is appointed unto man wants to die, but what?

365
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,960
After this, the judgment.

366
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,240
So we believe this evening in the certainty of eternity,

367
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
do we not?

368
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,080
Every single person that I come into contact with,

369
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,480
every single person that you come into contact with

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,000
is going to have an eternity somewhere.

371
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,840
We believe that.

372
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,400
Biblically, we believe that.

373
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
The Bible teaches us,

374
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,320
and we'll look at it from our perspective

375
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,440
with regard to save people first

376
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,680
in 2 Corinthians chapter number five.

377
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,480
See, Paul understood this.

378
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
Why is it that he says,

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,560
as I have an opportunity to submit a request for prayer

380
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,280
to these believers at Ephesus,

381
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,520
what is it that I'm gonna ask them to pray for me?

382
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,960
Well, he says that I would speak as I ought to speak

383
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
the gospel with boldness.

384
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
This evening, he understood the command of Christ,

385
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,680
but he understood the certainty of eternity.

386
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,440
Notice in 2 Corinthians chapter number five,

387
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,400
he begins the chapter by saying, for we know.

388
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,320
There's some things that we know, amen,

389
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
because God has revealed them to us.

390
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,600
There's a lot of people that you can talk to

391
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,720
that you can go around this room and say,

392
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,480
well, nothing can be certain.

393
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,760
No, no, no, there are some things that can be certain.

394
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,520
There are some things that we know,

395
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,120
and we can be assured of, and we can have confidence in,

396
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,400
and we can stand on them, and we can speak with authority,

397
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
not because we are the authority,

398
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,240
but because God is the authority.

399
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
And we find that in 2 Corinthians five,

400
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
he begins in verse number one, for we know.

401
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
Notice as we skip through the passage,

402
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
look at verse number four, he says,

403
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,480
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan,

404
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,920
being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed,

405
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,200
but clothed upon that mortality

406
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,960
might be swallowed up of life.

407
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I love 2 Corinthians five four,

408
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,760
and the verbiage that God uses

409
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,640
in how mortality will be swallowed up of life.

410
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,680
It's like the verse of scripture, no doubt,

411
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,320
had an impact and an influence on D.L. Moody

412
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,440
when he said, when you read that I'm dead,

413
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,480
just remember that I'm more alive than I've ever been.

414
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
Why?

415
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Because mortality will be swallowed up of life.

416
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,600
He says in verse number eight, for we are confident,

417
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,280
I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body

418
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,120
and to be present with the Lord.

419
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,520
He tells them in 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

420
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,600
that I'm giving you this by the word of the Lord.

421
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,559
He's teaching them about the rapture,

422
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,440
and he's teaching them about the certainty of the rapture

423
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,480
and the eternity that we'll have,

424
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,000
those that are saved by the grace of God

425
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
that we will have with our Savior,

426
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,520
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

427
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,559
Aren't those wonderful words?

428
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,960
In fact, they're followed up with these words,

429
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,520
wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

430
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,080
And so Paul had an understanding of the command of.

431
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,080
And by the way, that's the priority, the order that I'm giving you these thoughts this evening,

432
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:12,080
not that the list that I'll provide you with tonight is an exhaustive list on why we ought to proclaim the gospel,

433
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,080
but three thoughts on why we ought to proclaim the gospel.

434
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,080
But our number one motivation ought to be to obey Christ.

435
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,080
That we could stand before someone like Paul stood before Agrippa and say,

436
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,080
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.

437
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,080
No, I didn't have a heavenly vision like Paul did, and neither did you,

438
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,080
but I had a revelation that's recorded in God's word that I have a personal responsibility,

439
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
and so do you, to proclaim the gospel.

440
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:53,080
And by the way, Paul is bound at this point, he's going to go and have to appeal to Caesar and all that's taking place,

441
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,080
and Caesar said, what have you, because of what? Because he's preached the gospel.

442
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
But he says, I've not been disobedient to the command of Christ.

443
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,080
But then we see the certainty of eternity that everyone that we know is going to spend forever somewhere.

444
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,080
So we find for the believer the confidence that we have in heaven, Revelation chapter 20.

445
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,080
We're familiar with the passage of scripture, it's a sad portion of scripture.

446
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I do not enjoy reading the last of several verses of Revelation chapter 20.

447
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll just read verses 14 and 15 this evening,

448
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,080
but it's a sad section of God's word that describes for us the great white throne judgment.

449
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,080
The Bible says in verse 14, in death and hell, we're cast in the lake of fire, this is the second death.

450
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,080
And whosoever is not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

451
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080
We have to come to a place where we truly believe what God says in his word,

452
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:59,080
and allow it to impact our behavior with regard to the subject of proclaiming the gospel.

453
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:09,080
See, mankind, humanity, they have one of two destinations for eternity.

454
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Heaven or the lake of fire.

455
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
We believe that this evening.

456
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
The Bible plainly teaches that.

457
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:24,080
The Bible does not teach, as some denominations teach, as some organizations teach,

458
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
that there's some holding place, there's some in-between place,

459
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,080
that if you weren't quite good enough, you can kind of spend some time there

460
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,080
so that you can be refined enough to be able to go to heaven,

461
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,080
or so that your loved ones might be able to pray or really to pay for you to be able to...

462
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,080
No, that's not what the Bible teaches.

463
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:55,080
The Bible's very plain that there's just one of two eternal destinations for humanity.

464
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:04,080
And when we truly understand the command of Christ, we ought to proclaim the gospel.

465
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,080
When we understand the certainty of eternity, we ought to proclaim the gospel.

466
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Number three, when we understand the condition of humanity.

467
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
The condition of humanity.

468
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
What do I mean by that?

469
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
You mean, pastor, that the society today is real bad?

470
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Listen, mankind's been real bad for 6,000 years.

471
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,080
I mean, listen, if you go back, I understand that oftentimes we will say something like this.

472
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
It's never been as bad as it is today.

473
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,080
And the problem with that statement is we really don't know history.

474
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Because the reality is that the world was so bad

475
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,080
that God destroyed it with a flood in Genesis chapter 6.

476
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Sodom and Gomorrah were so wicked that God rained fire and brimstone upon them.

477
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,080
There are periods of time throughout Israel's history, as you can read,

478
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,080
just in the historical content that God gives us in the Bible of great periods of wickedness,

479
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,080
of offering their children to false gods on altars.

480
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,080
I mean, just wickedness.

481
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,080
I understand that because of the era in which we're living

482
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,080
and because of the availability to news and so on and so forth,

483
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
that it just seems like it's just worse than it's ever been.

484
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,080
And certainly things are getting worse and worse.

485
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,080
But it didn't just happen in this generation that mankind became depraved.

486
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Amen?

487
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,080
We believe that mankind is born sinners.

488
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
And that's the condition of humanity.

489
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
The condition of humanity.

490
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Romans 3 and verse number 10, as it is written,

491
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,080
there's none righteous, no, not one, for all have sinned

492
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
and come short of the glory of God.

493
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Verse 10 and verse 23, we are familiar with these verses of Scripture.

494
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,080
In fact, if we were to ask this evening, can you quote some of these verses,

495
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
many of us could quote these verses.

496
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
We know them, we're familiar with them, we believe them.

497
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
But the reality is that at some point the belief of those verses

498
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,080
have to impact the behavior of God's people.

499
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Romans 5 and verse number 12, a verse that we're familiar with

500
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,080
with regard to the entrance of sin into the world

501
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,080
and how sin passes from one generation to the next.

502
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
It says,

503
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,

504
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,080
and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

505
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,080
So we find this evening that there's this condition of humanity.

506
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Notice how Paul explains it to the believers in Ephesus and Ephesians,

507
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080
chapter number 2, as Paul is giving to them this truth

508
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
with regard to the condition of humanity.

509
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,080
And for us to be able to recognize that we were in the same boat,

510
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,080
we were in the same condition, and now we're simply saved by the grace of God.

511
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,080
In Ephesians chapter 2, in verse number 1, Paul says this,

512
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,080
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins,

513
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,080
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,

514
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,080
according to the prince of the power of the air,

515
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,080
the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

516
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,080
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past.

517
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
How many of us? We all had our conversation in times past.

518
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
This was our condition.

519
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
And so it says,

520
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,080
In the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,

521
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,080
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

522
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,080
As we begin to think about the truth of Ephesians chapter 6

523
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
and the request that Paul makes,

524
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,080
and in this request revealing to us what we ought to be doing,

525
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,080
because no doubt if Paul understood that he ought to be proclaiming the gospel,

526
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:19,080
then every child of God ought to recognize that we too should be proclaiming the gospel.

527
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
How is it that we proclaim the gospel?

528
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Well, it's varied.

529
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,080
As a church, we have organized times of being able to go out and share the gospel.

530
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,080
And why is it that we have organized times of being able to share the gospel?

531
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Why is it as a church that we have these Saturday mornings

532
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
and we go out and we use maps and we try to reach our community?

533
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Well, we want to with purpose and on purpose and systematically and strategically,

534
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,080
we want to reach our community with the gospel.

535
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,080
We want to be in a place where this is, as we often use the analogy,

536
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,080
our church is a beacon of hope, is a light in this community.

537
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
By the way, there's a lot of hurting people in our community.

538
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,080
There are people every day that are dealing with disease,

539
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,080
they're dealing with divorce, they're dealing with just various levels of dispute

540
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:25,080
and the number of calls that our law enforcement receive on domestic violence

541
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,080
is so regular in our society, in our community.

542
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,080
The number of attempts in our community of suicide is alarming.

543
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,080
You say, no, not in Fairfax County. Absolutely in Fairfax County.

544
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,080
A lot of people that can make things look pretty nice on the outside,

545
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,080
but the reality is that they need Christ.

546
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,080
And God's placed us here as a light.

547
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,080
We know that the enemy seeks to deceive and to keep blinded,

548
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,080
but God's people need to have this understanding that Paul has

549
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
as he communicates to the believers in Ephesus,

550
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
and we this evening need to come to the place where we say,

551
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
you know what, I ought to proclaim the gospel.

552
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,080
As a church, we want to systematically and strategically share the gospel.

553
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,080
We have gospel tracts available in our tract rack.

554
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Every time that you come in and go out of our sanctuary,

555
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,080
the opportunity to take gospel tracts so that you can have a place

556
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,080
and being able to share the gospel with someone.

557
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,080
There are unique ways. We dealt with it on Sunday nights just a few months ago

558
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
with regard to how to share our personal testimonies

559
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
and the opportunities that God gives.

560
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,080
And we've got to be purposed in it because we understand these truths.

561
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
We understand that we've been given a command.

562
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
We've been given a command.

563
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,080
When a command is given, there's really only two options,

564
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
obedience or disobedience.

565
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
There's really no middle ground.

566
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,720
God. We understand the certainty of eternity, that every person that we come in contact

567
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,040
with is going to spend forever in one of two places. And the condition of humanity reveals

568
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,480
to us that most of those that we come in contact with, because of understanding the statistics,

569
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,640
they've never even heard the gospel, that means most people are still lost and therefore

570
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,680
on their way to the Christless eternity in the lake of fire. And as we understand these

571
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,640
truths, see, I said this to someone recently, I said, you know, I have zero desire, I don't

572
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:45,480
want to see anyone go to the lake of fire. Listen, if we truly understand tonight, these

573
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:54,400
three simple truths, how could we look at anyone and not have a desire to share with

574
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,560
them truth? Why? Because they're not going to believe us? It's okay. Jesus said just

575
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,680
shake off the dust and go to the next person. Our job is not for whether or not they believe

576
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:15,880
us. Our job is not for how they view us. Ron and I were knocking doors and we were in the

577
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,200
neighborhood over there where Magnus and Alexis live and we're knocking doors and so we purposefully

578
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,080
knocked on Alexis's door. Why? Because man, at least somebody's going to be nice to us this

579
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,120
morning. Amen. And we knocked on her door and she answered and she sure enough, she was gracious and

580
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,600
nice. And she said to Ron and I, she said, now did you guys go to this house over here? And she kind

581
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,920
of told us what house she was talking to. She's like, because I've really been trying to work on

582
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,920
that. And I said, well, no, we haven't gotten there yet, but that's going to kind of be our last stop

583
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,520
and where we parked and where we started the kind of that's where we're going to end. And we go over

584
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:55,600
there and Ron, if you remember, that was kind of the worst door of the day. But it doesn't mean we

585
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:05,080
don't continue to go because our job is not on how they respond. Our job is on whether we proclaim

586
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:12,400
the gospel. That individual can kind of slam the door in our face and kind of throw up his hands

587
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:19,120
as he did. Like, I can't believe you're here from the church. But one day he's going to stand before

588
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:28,840
God. But one day I'm going to stand before God. And according to the book of Ezekiel, the watchman

589
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:36,920
doesn't give an account for whether the people respond to the warning. He gives an account on

590
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,800
whether he gave the warning. And I believe that's what Paul is referencing in Ephesians chapter,

591
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,320
or excuse me, Acts chapter 20. When he's talking to those leaders of the church at Ephesus,

592
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:58,960
he makes at least two, maybe more, but obviously two direct comments that correspond to the truth

593
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,440
from the book of Ezekiel with being a watchman. Paul knew the Old Testament. He was aware of the

594
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,280
truth that God had communicated, and he knows that the watchman, if he does not warn, then he's

595
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:22,560
responsible. But if the watchman warns, he's not responsible for the response of those warned. So

596
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:30,280
Paul says, what am I doing? I'm warning every man night and day with tears for a space of three

597
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:37,320
years. But yet when he writes to the church at Ephesus, he says, would you pray for me that

598
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,440
utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the

599
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:52,480
gospel for which I am an ambassador and bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

600
00:33:52,760 --> 00:34:01,160
This evening, I don't think any one of us, any one of you would disagree that we ought to proclaim

601
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:08,920
the gospel. It's our duty. Very practically, if we don't tell, if we don't proclaim the gospel,

602
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:19,160
who's going to? We can't, we can't, look, the false teachers, the false world religions,

603
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm thankful that there are some other churches, even here in Fairfax County,

604
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,680
that preach the gospel. Many of those churches, the pastors are friends, and I thank the Lord

605
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,960
for them. But you know what the statistics would tell us here in Fairfax County? The last time I

606
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,720
looked at the population of our county, coupled with the number of churches in our county that

607
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,040
preach the gospel that I'm aware of. Now, I understand there may be some that are preaching

608
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,840
the gospel that I don't know, I'm not aware of the church and what have you, but that I'm aware

609
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:00,040
of doing some research, the ones that are preaching the gospel, that if every church in our county

610
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:07,760
reached 10,000 people a year, the churches that I know of that are proclaiming the gospel, it would

611
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,640
take us about 11 years to reach everybody in our county one time. You know what the reality is?

612
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,200
We're not reaching 10,000 people every year, and most of those other churches aren't reaching

613
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,160
10,000 people every year either. But 10,000 people a year, it still takes 11, you know how many people

614
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:36,160
in our county are going to die in 11 years? If we don't tell them, who will? We ought to proclaim

615
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,120
the gospel. Number one, there's a command. Number two, there's the certainty of eternity. And number

616
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,840
three, there's the condition of humanity. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. Thank you for

617
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,880
loving us. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to be your representatives, your ambassadors. I

618
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:08,760
pray God that you would use us, help us to have a renewed commitment to obey this great commission

619
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,800
that you've given to us. Help us to speak with boldness, help us to proclaim the gospel. We

620
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,600
thank you for the privilege of prayer. I pray that you would bless the remainder of our service,

621
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,880
for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
