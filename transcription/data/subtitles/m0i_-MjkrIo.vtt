WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.659
1 Timothy chapter number 2 and I'll be looking just at verse number 1 this morning and next

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:12.000
week we have a missionary that'll be with us and then we'll continue through this portion

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of Scripture.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.319
But I want to focus our attention simply this morning on verse number 1, 1 Timothy 2 and

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.319
verse number 1.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.959
The memory verse for the month of February is 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 8.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:27.319
It's only the fourth of the month but someone came to me this morning and said, I got it

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.479
memorized, can I quote it to you and that was an encouragement to me and so thank the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.479
Lord for that.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.319
1 Timothy 2, 8 will be the memory verse for the month of February.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.400
But this morning we'll look at 1 Timothy 2 and verse number 1.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.319
Notice what the Bible says, I exhort therefore that first of all supplications, prayers,

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.840
intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.759
I understand there's not a period there but I want to focus our attention this morning

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.659
on verse number 1.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.479
The subject of prayer is addressed regularly in the Bible.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.519
In fact, these are some estimates with regard to the number of references of the subject

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.440
of prayer in our Bibles.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.680
It's estimated that there are 650 prayers that are recorded throughout God's Word.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.480
It is estimated that there are 450 answers to prayer that are recorded in God's Word.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.639
As you study through the Gospels, it is estimated that there are 25 different times in which

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.319
you read of Jesus praying in the Gospels.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:36.080
And so we find that prayer is a subject matter that is often addressed throughout the Bible.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.580
As believers, we have been invited to bring our petitions to the Lord.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.319
By the way, we ought not take that invitation lightly that God has invited us to enter directly

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.720
into His presence.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.760
The opportunity that we have, as it says in Hebrews 4, that we can come boldly under the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.040
throne of grace, when He says to Jeremiah, call unto me.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
What a great invitation.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.239
Have you ever had someone say this to you, hey, if you need any help, let me know.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.120
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.360
And maybe when they said it because you knew them, you thought, they really don't want

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.039
me to call them, they're just being kind.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.399
You ever thought that?

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:18.639
And no doubt we've probably had that kind of an experience where maybe we thought, well,

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.759
that was just a kind gesture, they felt like they had to say it, but they really don't

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.960
want me to call them for help.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.960
When Jesus, when God said, call unto me, you're not going to cause Him to be overwhelmed

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960
or overtired.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.919
He wants us to bring our petitions to Him.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.639
He's invited us.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:45.559
And we better never take it lightly that God has extended to His children an invitation

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.160
to prayer.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.479
Not only have we been invited to pray, but we've been instructed throughout the Scriptures,

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.080
we've been instructed to be people of prayer.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.199
We understand that as we study through the Bible that we have been given numerous promises

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.520
regarding the subject of prayer, and what a blessing to understand this morning that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.240
our God is able to answer, that He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.839
we ask or think, and that helps us to be aware of the impact of prayer.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.279
We see that there's been an invitation that's been extended, we find that we've been instructed

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:29.679
to be people of prayer, but then God reveals to us in His Word the impact of prayer.

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:34.559
It's amazing, there are times in the Scriptures that you'll read lengthy prayers, you'll read

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:40.380
of really, maybe we could call it an eloquent kind of a prayer, but at other times you simply

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.720
read a prayer that's just, Lord, help.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.240
Just help, Lord.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.240
You find that at times you read very quickly a prayer that is uttered by a servant of the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.279
Lord and you have the opportunity to see how God works and what God does, and we see the

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.960
impact of prayer as you study the Bible.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.479
This morning, I'm so thankful that we have a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.479
I hope that this morning you have experienced in your life as I've experienced in my life

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.240
where God answers prayer.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.600
By the way, it's so encouraging.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.519
It builds our faith when God answers prayer, and when we pray specifically, we have the

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:27.559
opportunity to see specifically what God is able to do.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:33.339
When you pray just general prayers, you do not have that same benefit of increasing your

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:38.660
faith and impacting you in the area of your prayer life because you pray generally and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.799
maybe you can't see specifically how God has answered.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.640
This morning, our God hears and answers.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.040
He hears the specific cries of His people.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.459
He's never bothered when you enter into His presence.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:53.000
He never says, okay, your time is up.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.839
No, the God of the universe, the God that is omnipotent, that is omniscient, that is

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:05.720
immutable, the one who is King of kings and Lord of lords, He says, call unto me and I

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.160
will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
God said this.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
I believe it was John R. Rice.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
He said this, all of our problems are prayer problems.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.679
That's a good statement.

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:23.679
All of our problems are prayer problems.

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:31.440
It is sad to consider this morning how often prayer is neglected in the lives of His people.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.880
I think if we'd be honest this morning, there are times in which we've neglected to pray.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.679
We've not taken the admonition that we find in the book of James where the Bible says

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.040
any sick, let them pray.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.679
We're not taking the admonition from this, the exhortation from this verse of Scripture

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:49.799
that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks, that prayer

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:55.720
is not that priority, if you will, that we do not see in our lives this consistency in

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.720
our prayer lives.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.559
Let me say this this morning.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:06.679
We should not need a tragedy in our lives to drive us to our knees.

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:10.160
We should not need a tragedy in our lives to drive us to our knees.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:20.799
Unfortunately, if we're not careful, we can neglect prayer until that tragedy occurs and

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:25.720
then all of a sudden we fall on our knees and we get in the presence of God.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.000
But it should not require for you and for me to have a tragedy in order to cause us

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.160
to pray.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.959
No, we should be people of prayer.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.799
Our lives should be marked by prayer.

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:43.559
I believe this morning that prayer is essential in the life of a believer.

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.920
The little blurb that Holly put in the bulletin, to be a Christian without prayer is no more

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.480
possible than to be alive without breathing.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.640
I like that quote.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640
Why?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640
Because prayer is essential.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.760
If we're believers, we ought to be in communion with our Father.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.899
If we've been told in the Scriptures that He is our Father and we are His children,

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:07.100
we ought to be in communion with our Father.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.399
We find this morning that if we would agree that prayer is essential, that I would say

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:17.579
this, that structure in our prayer lives is the key to consistency.

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:21.820
A key to consistency is that there's structure in our prayer lives.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.980
That's why I've titled the message this morning from this single verse of Scripture,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.420
structure in your prayer life.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.100
Structure in your prayer life.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.739
As we begin to think about the subject of prayer, we understand this morning that we

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:36.179
are to pray believing.

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:37.179
We're to pray in faith.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:42.820
We're to pray believing that God hears us, believing that God is able, believing that

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.420
He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.040
We are to pray in faith.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.899
We serve the omniscient God.

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:56.660
We find, I read just this past week about the great prayer of Hezekiah and all that

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.619
was against him with the armies that had gathered and Rabshakeh saying all of the things

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:07.500
that he was saying with regard to all of the victories that had been experienced by their

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.500
army.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.959
But Hezekiah believed that the God who spoke the world into existence was able.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:21.779
He believed that God could do something about his circumstances and he prayed in faith.

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:24.220
He prayed believing.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.859
We find that we're also to pray with confidence.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:33.700
Listen, I pray in confidence that my God hears me, that He promised to do so.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.820
Have you ever spoken to someone and you said, are you listening to me?

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.299
They're distracted, maybe they're on that wonderful device that we call a smartphone

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:47.380
and you think, man, they're distracted, they're not hearing me and we want to make sure that

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:53.820
we have a measure of confidence that the person that we're speaking to is hearing us.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.020
And I tell you this morning that we can pray in confidence.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:02.580
We can pray confidently knowing that our God hears us.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.479
I think about the passage of Scripture with the situation with Elijah and all of the worshippers

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:12.940
of Baal and as they're crying out and cutting themselves and all that they're doing to try

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:19.099
to get the attention of their false god to send fire.

00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:20.099
He didn't hear, why?

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:21.099
Because he can't.

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.659
He's a false god.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:26.940
In fact, the idols are described throughout the Scriptures, the Psalms, a couple of different

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.979
Psalms deal with it, where they have ears but they hear not.

00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:35.179
They have, and we deal with all of those subjects and we find this morning that our God hears

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:36.179
us.

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:41.219
We're to pray, I believe this morning, not only in faith, believing that God can, not

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:45.419
only with confidence that He hears us, but we ought to pray with expectancy.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.859
We ought to pray expecting that God's going to answer.

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:52.500
We ought to pray expecting, listen, it should not be a surprise in your life and in my life

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:54.659
when God answers prayer.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:10:00.020
We should pray expectantly with this measure of expectancy.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:06.460
understand this morning that we are not to pray with vain repetitions.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.300
We are not to pray with vain repetitions.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.060
We find that we are not to pray for recognition.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.440
Those that were praying as Jesus was ministering, the religious leaders of the day that would

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.620
pray with the idea of having recognition from those that would hear their voices as they

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.280
would stand and pray with some eloquent speech and what have you.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.280
God said they have their reward.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.040
What was their reward?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.240
Really it was the applause of man, the recognition of man.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.440
But he told us when we pray that we are to go in our closet.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440
Pray in secret.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440
Why?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Because our Father hears us.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.640
We are not to pray for recognition.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.840
It's not that someone would say, oh man that was such a wonderful prayer.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.880
It's not the idea.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.080
Praying to our God.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.280
Prayer should be as easy as it is for you to talk to anybody else.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.080
It's communing with our Father.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.580
We need to have some structure in our prayer lives.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.920
As we look at this single verse of Scripture this morning, I notice just a couple of thoughts.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.080
Number one, notice there's a priority on prayer, a priority on prayer.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.120
The Bible says, I exhort therefore.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.120
Now consider the context of the book of 1 Timothy.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.200
We've studied through the first 20 verses of chapter number 1 and we come now to chapter

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200
number 2.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200
So the chapter divisions are there for our ease of reading and getting to the passage.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.920
But Paul says to Timothy, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, I exhort therefore

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.780
that first of all, and he's going to deal with the subject of prayer.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.680
He places a priority, an emphasis on the subject of prayer.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.920
And we find this morning that when we understand the context of the book and what's going on

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.600
and the battle that they're facing, that Timothy is facing as he's there in Ephesus with all

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.800
of the false teaching that's prevalent.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:00.400
And those that have gone and dealt with these false teachers explaining their false teaching

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.360
and their desiring to be teachers of the law, but they don't understand the law, they don't

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.280
understand what they say, they're not qualified, they've, they've swerved, they've turned to

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.320
ving jangling.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.880
We mentioned last week how that these two names specifically that they have put away

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.140
concerning the faith, literally to thrust away.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:25.500
And these false teachings are beginning to invade the church at Ephesus, and Paul as

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:32.940
he continues to exhort and to encourage his son in the faith to continue to war a good

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:40.620
warfare as we dealt with last Sunday morning, he places an emphasis on the subject of prayer.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.820
Can I tell you this morning that you cannot war a good warfare, that you are not going

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.780
to continue if you neglect prayer.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.540
Prayer is vital, prayer is essential, and if we're going to continue, if we're going

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.540
to war a good warfare, if we're gonna deal in these last days with all of the things

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.380
that we're gonna deal with as we look in chapter number three of 2 Timothy, it'll be months

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.420
from now before we get to that passage and dissect it specifically.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:17.900
But if we're gonna deal with those things in our world today, we must be people of prayer.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.180
It is absolutely vital.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.100
We see in the early church, in the book of Acts, what's amazing about the church of,

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.220
there as you see as you go through the book of Acts and see what happens in the first

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.380
century, they're people of prayer.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.300
Peter was arrested and he's thrown in prison, and guess what the church did?

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.660
They had an all-night prayer meeting.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.460
You know it used to be common even in our America, the church would have all-night prayer

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.580
meetings.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.900
Now we have once a week on a Wednesday a prayer meeting and a third of the church shows up.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.140
I'm just being honest.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.300
We've not put an emphasis on prayer.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.020
We've neglected prayer.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:08.460
And this morning as we begin to think about the priority that is placed on prayer, we

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.100
see that he says, first of all, listen, if you're gonna engage in this world, if you're

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:21.100
going to interact and you're going to be engaged in this world, you better be prayed up.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:28.100
Several years ago, they've not had the opportunity to sing it recently, but Juliana, Brianna,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.860
and Holly sang a song about a wall of prayer.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.100
And thinking about how we engage in prayer, listen, there needs to be a priority placed

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.100
on prayer.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.340
And we find that this morning, what place, I would ask myself and I'd ask you to ask

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.220
yourself this morning, what place does prayer have in your life?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.020
What place does prayer have in my life?

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.620
I wonder this morning, does my schedule or does your schedule reveal that we've placed

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.500
a priority on prayer?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.980
Now understand when I phrase the question that way, I'm not simply meaning that we should

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.260
have some schedule where we schedule, no, we ought to be praying all the time.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.460
But listen, if you don't plan to pray, you're not going to pray.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.460
How many of you have experienced that in your life?

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:18.140
I'm telling you, your day is going to get away from you in a moment if you don't plan

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.580
to pray.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.980
Things are going to come up, this is going to happen, those mothers that have young children,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.900
man, those kids are going to be, listen, sometimes we've got to wake up earlier in the morning

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.980
so that we can spend some time in prayer.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.060
Someone's like, pastor, you must be an early person, you love the mornings, no, actually

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.460
I'd rather stay up late at night.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.340
I'm just being honest, naturally, I'm a night owl.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.740
But guess what happens when you stay up too late?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.820
You can't get up in the morning.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:50.100
Something so simple that I said so many years ago, if you want to wake up early, you got

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.180
to go to bed early.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.900
It's a simple thing, but you know what?

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.540
If you get up too late, your day is just gone by, man.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.740
This happens, and that happens, and this distraction, and that distraction, and before you know

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.180
it, you say, I haven't even prayed yet, I haven't spent time with the Lord.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.900
I don't agree with a whole lot of things that Luther did or said, there are some things

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.980
that I agree with, but Luther said of himself that on his busiest of days, he got up earlier

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.180
in the morning so that he could spend more time with God in prayer.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.480
Wow.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.320
Most of us have the idea that if I have a super busy day, I'm going to get up early

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.840
so I can get a head start on it, I'm going to get all the things done.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.720
Mueller said, I'm going to reference something from Mueller, another reference in Mueller's

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:42.280
life, but Mueller had the idea that, listen, I'm not going to do anything, anything until

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.080
I've had a good season of interaction, prayer, communion with my Father.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.400
Now, if you know anything about Mueller, how many of you have read something about Mueller?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.440
Man, he's got an amazing testimony of so many answers to prayer, and so many amazing

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440
things.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440
Why?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440
He spent time with God.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.560
He planned it.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.680
We understand that Paul gives the admonition to the church in Thessalonica that we're to

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.520
pray without ceasing.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.560
It does not mean that you can be every moment of every day in a season of prayer, but it

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.920
does mean that we ought to be able to pray at any moment, that we have that communion

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:21.520
with our Father, and we begin to understand that we are to be people of prayer, and that

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.120
we are to engage every day of our lives, we are to be people of prayer.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.680
So often, you don't need to turn there, but I think about it in the life of Nehemiah when

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.120
you think about the subject of the idea of pray without ceasing.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.840
In Nehemiah chapter number one, we find that Nehemiah receives a report with regard to

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.000
Jerusalem.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
The report is not a good report, and it causes Nehemiah to seek the face of God, and he spends

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.600
time in prayer.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.280
Part of that prayer is recorded for us in Nehemiah chapter number one, where he's praying,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.080
he's seeking the face of God, he's calling out to the Lord, he's praying for the forgiveness

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.000
of sin, and all of these things.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
We come to the second chapter of the book of Nehemiah, and we find that Nehemiah is

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.240
now going to stand before the king.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.480
Why is he standing before the king?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.360
Well, because he's the king's cupbearer, and he's going to stand before the king, and as

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.420
he stands before the king, the king recognizes and sees that there's something different

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.840
about his countenance.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.680
Well, no doubt the events that had been reported to him that are given to us in Nehemiah one

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.400
had affected him, and therefore it was visible.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.320
Have you ever seen somebody say, man, something was just said to that person, they're dealing

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.040
with some bad news, something, and you can see it on their countenance.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.640
So the king, Artaxerxes, he recognizes, he says, hey, this is nothing but sorrow of

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.480
heart.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.280
And then the king says this in verse number four of Nehemiah two, for what dost thou make

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280
request?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.600
And then the Bible says this, so I prayed.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.679
Can I tell you in that moment, Nehemiah didn't have an hour to go seek the face of God.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.480
I believe, because in the very next verse it says, then, and I said unto the king, you

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.160
know what I think Nehemiah did?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.000
One of those Lord help me kind of prayers.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.400
He had spent time in prayer in Nehemiah chapter number one, but then Nehemiah chapter number

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.000
two, it's just a, so I prayed.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.160
See that ought to be in our lives.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.080
Something comes up in your life, something happens, I got a phone call last week about

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.040
something, it doesn't matter what it was about, and I said, listen, can I just pray

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040
with you right now?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.880
We just prayed on the phone.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.119
That we're constantly in that communion, that at any moment, for any reason, and we find

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:49.500
this morning, I ask myself the question, what place does prayer have in my life?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:55.559
We find that Paul is saying to Timothy, listen, in this life, as you're dealing with all that

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:59.160
you're dealing with, when you're seeking to fulfill the race that God's called you to

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160
fulfill.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160
When you're seeking to fulfill the ministry.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.160


00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.680
that He's called you to, He's equipped you, but He's given you this wonderful opportunity

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.920
to pray, to pray.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.040
I wonder this morning, do we have a time, do we have a place?

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.440
Think about Abraham, if you will.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:25.400
Abraham in Genesis 19, I'm going to reference just in passing, very quickly, three references,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.960
but in Genesis chapter 19, I want you to see what the Bible says about Abraham.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:38.520
In Genesis 19 and verse 27, the Bible says this, and Abraham got up early in the morning.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.760
He got up when?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760
Early in the morning.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:49.680
Notice what it says, to the place where he stood before the Lord.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.440
Abraham had a time, Abraham had a place.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.200
He got up early, he got up early, and he went to the place where he stood before the

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200
Lord.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.480
I want you to think about Daniel, and Daniel chapter number 6.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.360
We know about Daniel, and we understand the writing that was given with regard to the

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.480
enemies of Daniel that wanted him to be cast into the den of lions and all that took place

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.800
with Darius and so on and so forth, but we find that when they could find nothing against

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.560
Daniel concerning the laws of the land and what have you, they realized that what they

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:29.120
could do is have the king write this decree that if anyone asked a request of anyone other

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.880
than the king, they'd be cast into the den of lions.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.360
So the Bible tells us in Daniel 6 and verse number 10, now when Daniel knew that the writing

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.380
was signed, praise the Lord, I'm thankful that God included that.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.180
Every word of God is pure.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.900
I'm thankful that God included that.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.900
Why?

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.340
Because some of us, somebody might be like, well he didn't know it was written.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.340
No, no.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:22:03.080
He knew what the stakes were, but there was such an understanding of the need of prayer

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.020
that even though he knew that the writing was signed, what did he do?

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.660
He went to the place and he prayed.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.740
He was not fearful.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.660
He was going to commune with his father.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.420
The Bible says that he knew that the writing was signed.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.140
He went into his house and his window was being opened.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.580
He didn't shut him.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:29.140
Listen, I like the courage of Daniel.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.660
By the way, he got cast into the den of lions, but God took care of him.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.380
That's the God that we serve.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.180
By the way, Darius, he had an understanding that God could take care of him.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.420
Darius did everything he could to deliver Daniel from having to go to the den of lions,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.700
but Darius failed because Darius was just a human king, but the king of kings, he protected

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.700
his servant.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.560
And the Bible says that he opened, he goes in, his window's being opened, the chamber

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.660
toward Jerusalem.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.700
He kneeled down upon his knees three times a day and prayed, noticed and gave thanks

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.700
before his God.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:08.180
And then it says, as he did aforetime, he was a man of prayer, he was a man of prayer.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:13.660
Jesus had a place in John 18.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:19.660
The Bible tells us, and of course leading up to the arrest and the eventual crucifixion

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.660
of our Savior, followed by his glorious resurrection.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.300
The Bible says in John 18 in verse number 1, when Jesus had spoken these words, he went

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.260
forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.260
and his disciples.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:42.100
And then Judas, notice also which betrayed him, notice what it says, he knew the place.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.420
He knew the place.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420
Why?

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.820
For Jesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:56.820
When Jesus was in Jerusalem, his place was in the garden, it's where he prayed.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:02.220
And so we ask ourselves this morning, what priority, what place does prayer have in your

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.260
life and in my life?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:10.380
Because we find as we come to 1 Timothy chapter 2 in verse number 1, that Paul says, I exhort

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:18.540
therefore that first of all, notice he says, supplications, prayers, intercessions and

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.020
giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.180
We see number 1 this morning, a priority on prayer.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.740
We see number 2 this morning, a pattern for prayer.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.980
I titled the message, Structure in Your Prayer Life.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.580
There's a pattern that is given to us in chapter number 2, verse number 1, with regard to elements,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.180
if you will, of prayer.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:45.480
We find that it begins with supplications, supplications simply in treaty, humble and

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.900
earnest prayer in worship, a petition or a request.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.900
Can I say this?

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.860
Most of us are pretty good with supplications.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.500
It's almost as if God, we have a whole list of things that we want from you, it's like

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.100
a grocery list.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.580
Supplications is something that just kind of comes easy for us.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.580
But then it says prayers.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.260
Now this is kind of interesting, this is from 1820, Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary on what

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.260
prayer means.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.460
I love the definition that he gives, it's a lengthy definition.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.020
And here's what it says, asking with earnestness, that's the short part of it.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:25.460
It says it's a solemn address to God consisting of five things.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:32.540
The first thing that he mentions that it consists of is adoration, or an expression

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:38.900
of our sense of God's glorious perfectness.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.340
That's how the 1828 Noah Webster's dictionary begins to explain prayer.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.340
What is prayer?

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.340
It's adoration.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.380
We serve a great God, we dealt with it all year last year, great is the Lord and greatly

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.380
to be praised.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.780
Listen, we're to adore him, we're to stand in awe of who he is.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.900
Had a brief conversation with someone yesterday from our church, and as we're talking we're

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.540
just kind of, honestly just worshiping the Lord on how great he is.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.420
And how just he transcends us.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.060
It's amazing how great our God is, and when we pray, we begin, it consists of, number

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.540
one, adoration.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.020
Number two, confession of our sins.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.020
Confession of our sins.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.580
You know when you got saved and when I got saved, I didn't stop sinning, and neither

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580
did you.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.500
It'd be pretty nice if we did, but we didn't.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.180
It'd be really nice if the flesh was eradicated at the moment that we got saved, but no, it

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.440
did not, it was not eradicated.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440
But you know what?

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.340
We're no longer bound, we're no longer enslaved, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory,

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:47.540
we can, the Bible says, that we can walk in the spirit and not fulfill the lust of the

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540
flesh.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.180
It didn't say that the flesh isn't going to have its lusts and its desires, it just simply

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:58.900
says that if we walk in the spirit, we will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.420
Confession, you know what confession means?

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.460
It means to say the same thing, to acknowledge that it was wicked, that it was ungodly.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.140
You know how sometimes confession works for some of us?

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.260
God, if I sin, no, no, no, start over.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:19.460
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when you sinned, how you sinned, what was

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.140
the offense before a holy God?

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.940
That's confession.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:29.060
It's not this broad paintbrush of if I did, no, we did, we're sinners.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.580
I'm thankful to be saved by grace, I'm thankful to be heaven bound, amen?

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:40.060
But he says the second part, Webster in his dictionary, defining prayer, the second aspect

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.140
is confession of sins, but then number three, supplication for mercy and forgiveness.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.940
I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.940
I'm so thankful this morning that our God, the Bible says it this way, he is ready to

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.740
forgive, he is ready to pardon.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.060
First John chapter one, verse number nine, if we confess our sins, what, he is faithful

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.500
and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.320
The Bible tells us in chapter number two of the book of First John, that when we sin,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.000
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.160
Listen, I preached a whole message on the fact that Jesus is our advocate.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.440
I love the idea of that passage of scripture in First John chapter number two, because

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.740
we sin, you sin, I sin, but we have an advocate with the Father.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.600
The best way that we could describe an advocate today is a defense attorney.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.640
And so often today, you know what defense attorneys are trying to do?

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.540
They're trying to argue for the innocence of their client.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.860
They make up whatever stories they want to make up, they fabricate whatever they're trying

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.700
to fabricate to try to argue for the innocence of their clients.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.340
You know what your advocate, you know what my advocate does?

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.740
Tim, he says, he's guilty.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.220
He's guilty, but I paid for it.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:00.980
Wow, it's amazing when you understand what our advocate does.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.220
We're not innocent, we're guilty.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:12.060
And the old accuser comes, begins to try to accuse you because of some sin in your

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060
life.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.740
We have an advocate with the Father.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:21.140
He says, yes, he's guilty, but I paid for it, hallelujah.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.500
What a joy.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:30.260
Supplication for mercy and forgiveness, I'm thankful that our God is rich in mercy.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.260
What a joy.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:39.940
The number four aspect of the definition of prayer is intercession for blessings on others.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.900
This idea of intercessory prayer, so important.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:51.460
Sometimes what happens in our prayer life is it consists so much of just me and my life.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.500
But you know, we ought to be engaged in intercessory prayer.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.220
We're praying for one another.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.220
Brethren pray for us.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.140
That's what Paul said at the end of the book of 1 Thessalonians.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.140
He didn't just say it there.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.140


00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.220
other places as well. You know, what a joy it is to know that we can intercede for someone

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:11.480
else, that we can be those intercessors. We find that the fifth part that Webster indicates

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:19.120
with regard to defining the word prayer is thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, to give thanks.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.440
We adore who he is and then we thank him for the things that he does. If you read Psalm

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.800
chapter number 50 and you read about praise, you find that in Psalm 150, and you read

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.980
about praise in Psalm 150, you'll find that there's very clearly communicated in Psalm

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:42.360
150 that we're to praise God for who he is and for what he does. Our God is a great

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.760
God and he is to be adored. When we learn to praise him because of who he is, we'll

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.600
never lack reason to rejoice. For he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.680
king of kings, lord of lords. He's the Lord God omnipotent. He reigns, he rules, his way

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.720
is perfect, and it always is going to be. The third aspect in 1 Timothy chapter number

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:13.080
2, he says, first of all, supplications. That's the easy way to describe a petition or request.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.200
It's humble and earnest prayer and worship. He says prayers. And then he says intercessions.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:24.880
Prayer or solicitation to one party in favor of another. Well in the context of understanding

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.080
this subject of prayer, we find that what it is is that we're seeking the face of God

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.640
on behalf of a brother or sister in Christ, or maybe if we're praying for a lost person

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.360
we're seeking the face of God on the behalf of a lost person to be saved, but we find

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.680
this ministry of intercession, this intercessory prayer. We find that Moses is a great example

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.440
of an intercessor. We won't take the time, but you could go back and you can read various

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.480
aspects in the Pentateuch of where Moses is serving as an intercessor. He seeks the face

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.720
of God. A very familiar one is in Numbers chapter 14, after they're ready to stone

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.960
Joshua and Caleb and all that takes place and God's judgment is pronounced, and Moses

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:14.040
goes before the Lord. And he prays as an intercessor. He prays that God would forgive them. And

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:20.520
we find that Moses serves as an intercessor. You know, you can pray for yourself, but you

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:27.640
can pray for others. I'm thankful that people pray for me. I got a text last night from

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.400
a man that no one here knows. I barely know him. He's a pastor in the state of Virginia.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.040
I know him just a little bit. I don't see him that often. He sent me a text last night

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.920
and said, just want you to know I'm praying for you. It's an encouragement. Almost every

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.640
Sunday morning I pray for all of you. I pray for our church every Sunday morning by name.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.760
I go through this auditorium and kind of know where each person sits. That's why when you

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.720
move your seat, it messes me up. Amen? Josh and Aaron are way out of place this morning.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:01.720
Amen? But I know where people sit and I pray for you. But after I pray for you, I have

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.800
a whole list of preachers all around this country that I pray for. I pray that as they

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.680
get in the sacred desk, that God would use them. I don't send all of them a text message

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.200
and let them know I'm praying for them, but every once in a while, God, I'm pressed upon

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:20.040
my heart to let somebody know that I was praying for them. And what a blessing to think about

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.360
the fact that not only do I have the opportunity to pray for them, but I know that many of

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:30.520
them are praying for me. What a blessing. The ministry of intercessory prayer. He says

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.040
giving of thanks at the end of verse number one. Giving of thanks. Expressing gratitude.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.520
Philippians 4 says this, in Philippians 4 and verse number 6, a verse that many of us

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:50.440
are familiar with, the Bible says, be careful for nothing, but in everything. Remember I

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:57.720
told you the quote from John R. Rice? All of our problems are prayer problems. In everything,

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:06.000
by prayer and supplication with what? With thanksgiving. With thanksgiving, let your

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.560
request be made known unto God. We find that there's structure given to us in this verse

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:22.120
of scripture with regard to our prayer life. We see the priority, but we see a pattern.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:29.800
Now personally, I find that beginning my time of prayer with adoration and thanksgiving

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:37.400
helps immensely. As I enter into the time of prayer with God on a daily basis, when

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:44.280
I begin with that adoration and that thanksgiving, man it's a spirit of worship. Begin to just

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:50.880
fill your mind with who God is. And begin to really be overwhelmed at standing in awe

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.960
of who he is. Listen, my prayer life is not what it ought to be, but I'm trying to be

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.560
transparent this morning that when you start there, it's going to help you a whole lot.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.680
If you just start with a whole list of God, I need this today and I need that today and

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.520
would you help me with this today and so on and so forth, and then just kind of, no, no,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:12.440
I want to get into his presence. I want to worship him. I want to adore him. And when

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:19.960
I do, guess what? Not only is he pleased, but it helps me. It'll help you. And we find,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.480
I've mentioned this from this pulpit on many times over the years, that the hardest discipline

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:31.680
that I find in a Christian life is the discipline of prayer. Prayer is spiritual warfare. It's

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:41.120
spiritual battle. Your mind can wander in a moment. I like to pray out loud. If you

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.080
came in here, Dean popped in here on a Sunday morning one morning early, and I was up here

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.920
on the platform praying out loud, he probably thought I was crazy. I like to pray out loud.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.440
Why? Because it keeps me from being distracted. When I pray silently, I can get distracted

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:04.040
in a moment. I'm just being honest. So easy. You know what else? When you pray out loud,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:10.120
it kind of helps you not fall asleep. You ever fall asleep praying? The disciples did.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.600
Listen, if you did, you're in good company because the disciples did. I'm not saying

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.360
that it's, I'm not commending you for it, I'm just saying it's a human thing. You pray

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:28.480
out loud. I said this years ago, and I did it. I've only done it twice. I recorded myself

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:39.160
praying. And then I listened to it. You know why I did that? To help me. Because sometimes

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160
we can be scattered. You know what I found? There are some times that I repeated myself

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:49.480
multiple times in the time that I prayed. It was, it was instructive for me. It was

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.600
not the easiest thing to do. One of the hardest things is to listen to myself preach. I hate

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.640
it. Oh man, I should have said that different. I should have used this word instead of that

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.800
word. But it helped me when I listened to myself pray. I would encourage you, maybe

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.160
try it. Most of you have a smart phone that has a little recording device on it. All you

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.800
have to do is put that thing on and turn it on and just pray. Listen to it. See how

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:23.800
much you're praying, adoring God. See how much you're praying for others versus praying

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:31.440
for yourself. See, this morning, it's a time of worship. It's a time of communion with

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:37.440
my Heavenly Father that I get to enter into His presence. What a joy. That I'll never

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.640
be neglected. I mentioned that I was going to share this account that is given of George

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:55.200
Mueller. He's a great man of prayer. The account goes this way. It's an incident from the life

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.320
of George Mueller that was related by a man by the name of Mr. Inglis. This man, Mr. Inglis,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.200
heard the story firsthand from a captain of a ship. The captain of the ship was the

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:13.360
man who prayed with George Mueller, or really that George Mueller prayed with him. And as

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.440
they were taking a journey, this man, Mr. Inglis, heard this firsthand report and he's

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:23.960
recounting what he heard. And he says this, when I first came to America 31 years ago,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.320
I crossed the Atlantic with the captain of a steamer who was one of the most devoted

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:35.040
men I ever knew. And when we were off the banks of Newfoundland, he said to me, Mr.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.280
Inglis, the last time I crossed here, five weeks ago, one of the most extraordinary things

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:49.280
happened which has completely revolutionized the whole of my Christian life. He said up

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:56.960
to that time, I was one of your ordinary Christians. I'm not sure all that he meant by that, but

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.799
I would believe that he meant that he did pray and he read his Bible and so on and

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:08.679
so forth. But he says we had a man of God on board, George Mueller of Bristol. I'd been

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:13.920
on the bridge for 22 hours and never left it. I was startled by someone tapping me on

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.280
the shoulder. It was George Mueller. Captain, he said, I have to, I've come to tell you

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.920
that I must be in Quebec on Sunday afternoon. This was Wednesday. And his response to Mueller

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:36.720
was it is impossible. It is impossible. Very well, if your ship can't take me, this is

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.960
what George Mueller said, God will find some other means of locomotion to take me. I find

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:48.880
that to be amazing. Man of faith. He said this, I have never broken an engagement in

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.200
57 years. God gave me this engagement and I don't intend that God's going to let me

00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:00.600
break it is basically what he's communicating. He says I would willingly help you. How can

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:00.840
I?

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840
I am helpless."

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.080
That's what the captain says back to George Mueller.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.960
"'Let me go down to the chart room and pray.'

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.200
I looked at that man of God and I thought to myself, what lunatic asylum could that

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.920
man have come from?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.200
I never heard such a thing."

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.200
Why would you pray about this?

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.680
That's really kind of the thought.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.720
Again, he said that up to that point he would consider himself just an ordinary Christian,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:31.240
but this event completely revolutionized the whole of his Christian life.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:38.440
The account goes on to say that Mr. Mueller said, "'I do not know how dense the fog

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.440
is.'"

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.880
There was an issue with transporting because of the fog.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.640
He said, "'I do not know how dense the fog is.'

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:52.200
"'No,' he replied, "'my eye is not on the density of the fog, but on the loving

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.800
God who controls every circumstance in my life.'"

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:01.200
You know, sometimes our focus is just in the wrong place, just in the wrong place.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.760
We look at the problem instead of the God who is greater than the problem.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760
Amen?

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:13.200
Mueller said, "'No, no, you're looking at the fog, but I'm looking at God.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.280
Your eyes, your focus is on the wrong place.'"

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.480
And the account goes on to say that he got down on his knees and he prayed.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:27.320
What this man described as one of the simplest prayers, and he muttered to himself, that

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.080
would suit a children's class where the children were not more than eight or nine years old.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.920
By the way, we could learn some things from the prayers of some young kids.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.660
Do you know that your prayer and my prayer is not to impress God?

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:47.720
We can impress God, but if we're not careful, it's almost like we're trying to impress

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.700
God in how we pray.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.520
He said it was like an eight or nine year old prayed.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.200
That's how simple it was.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.880
Here's what he prayed, something like this, "'Oh Lord, if it is consistent with I will,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.680
please remove this fog in five minutes.'"

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.560
That's pretty specific.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.960
He says, "'You know the engagement you made for me in Quebec, and I believe it is your

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.960
will.'"

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.440
That's what he prayed.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.480
So then when he finished, the captain was going to pray.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.120
You know what George Mueller said to this captain?

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.880
He put his hand on his shoulder and he said, "'You don't need to pray.'"

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.880
Here's what George Mueller said according to this captain.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.080
He said, "'First, you do not believe that God will.'"

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.760
You don't believe that God will, so don't pray.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760
How are we to pray?

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.020
I said it by way of introduction, believing in faith.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.500
He said, "'You don't believe that God will pray.'"

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.440
Number two, here's what George Mueller said, "'I believe God's already answered.'"

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.040
So there's no need to pray.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.580
And there's no need whatsoever for you to pray about it.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.480
And I looked at him and George Mueller said, "'Captain, I have known my Lord for 47 years

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.680
and there's never been a single day that I have failed to gain an audience with the

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.040
King.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.160
Get up, captain, and open the door.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:22.120
You will find that the fog is gone.'"

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:28.160
Captain said, "'I got up, I opened the door, and the fog was gone.'"

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.000
And he made it to Quebec for his appointment that had been made.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.200
Why don't I share that account with you?

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.040
Well, it had a profound impact in that captain's life.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:44.240
He says his own testimony is that it completely revolutionized the whole of his Christian

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.920
life.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:51.400
I'm not sure this morning how your prayer life is.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.640
I would venture to say this morning that for every single one of us, our prayer life could

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.000
use some help.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.400
I don't care if your prayer life is better now than it's ever been, it could still use

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400
some help.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.000
It's not a criticism to say it that way.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.560
Just simply saying that we ought to be growing.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.360
We ought not get stagnant.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.720
We ought not flounder around.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.160
We understand that this portion of Scripture, I could have gone through verse number eight

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.600
this morning and just dealt with all of it.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.800
I was really leaning that way in the beginning of last week, but God just really stopped

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.840
me on verse number one.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840
There's a priority.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840
There's a pattern.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.160
If you're going to have structure in your prayer life, I'm going to have structure in

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160
my prayer life.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.480
I believe that having structure is a key to consistency in your prayer life.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.680
We just need to be people of prayer.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.560
Listen, you're not going to impress God with how eloquent you wax in your prayer time.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.360
You're just not.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.120
God knows your heart anyway.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.960
He knows my heart.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.800
Sometimes I go to God and say, God, I just, I know as kids I try to be careful with using

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.680
this word, but sometimes, I'm just stupid, God.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.080
I can't figure this stuff out.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080
God just help me.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.200
He said that if any man lacked wisdom that you'd give.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.000
God, I need wisdom.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.120
God knows that, and it's good for us to know that because if we don't know it, we're not

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.320
going to ask for it.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.440
This morning, how's my prayer life?

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.080
How's your prayer life?

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.440
Take some time this morning in our time of invitation to really just examine yourself

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.320
and ask God to help us in the area of our prayer lives.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.720
We don't see prayer answered in our lives.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.240
Our God is able.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.840
He's extended that invitation.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:39.440
He's given us instruction, and we see throughout the Bible the impact of prayer this morning.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440
How's our prayer life?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440
Let's pray.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.200
Lord, I ask that you'd work in these moments.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.840
I pray that you'd move in ways that only you could.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:46:00.880
I pray that this morning you've taken this truth from this verse of Scripture that you'd

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.920
impact the lives of your people.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.160
God help us to be people of prayer.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.120
Help us to have structure in our prayer lives.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:17.400
Help us, Lord, to never be guilty of neglecting prayer, that it would be our first response

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.840
and not our last resort.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:31.920
And God, we'd see you work in amazing ways because you're able.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:38.640
You're the omnipotent God who has all power, who spoke everything into existence.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.680
You said, is anything too hard for me?

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.800
Lord, there's nothing that's too hard for you.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:54.880
And I pray that you'd help us this morning to truly examine our prayer lives, that, Lord,

00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.480
we'd have structure and we'd have emphasis, or excuse me, consistency in our prayer lives.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.640
We'll give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.640
we pray.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.880
Would you stand with me?

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.880
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.280
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano this morning, and I'm going to ask you to

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.960
just be honest with the Lord, just do business with God.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.880
If you're not saved, I didn't preach on salvation this morning, but if you're not saved, I'll

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.800
take a Bible and show you, you'll know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.160
But let's do business with God this morning as we examine our prayer lives.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.640
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
