1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020
meeting is just a place on a calendar. Just because we hold a revival meeting

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,279
doesn't mean that God is going to change us or that there's going to be revival.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,459
But I do believe that revival meetings are important because they mark a time

4
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:27,219
in our lives where we can say to the Lord, speak to me. Where we give God the

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:32,139
opportunity because we are opening the Word and we are looking at Scripture and

6
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:38,540
we can say, please use this time to work in my life. The other thing I would say

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,540
about revival is this. I spend a lot of my time looking at the world and

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,259
critiquing the world and finding all that there is in the world that is going

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,419
wrong and being done wrong and doing wrong and all of that. I'm a fundamental

10
00:00:56,419 --> 00:01:02,180
Baptist preacher. I can see the wrong in anything and bring it out. But you know,

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,580
a time like this in our lives, these meetings are less about us examining the

12
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,459
world and more about making sure that we give God the opportunity to examine us.

13
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:23,059
Because the truth is, revival doesn't start in the world. It doesn't start in

14
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:29,059
the halls of Congress. It doesn't start in the White House. It starts in me.

15
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:36,699
And so I pray with that spirit and with that understanding, you'll look to this

16
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:44,819
message tonight and just allow God to speak into your life. I am saying very

17
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,540
clearly at the beginning of this message that I'm asking God to do the same thing

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,819
in my life. I'm not scolding you. I'm not trying to be harsh in my preaching. I'm

19
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,620
trying to be honest with myself and allow the Holy Spirit to have time to

20
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,500
look at me. And my prayer is that you'll do the same thing. Having said that,

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,339
turn with me to Hosea chapter 7. Now Hosea hangs around with Daniel. And if

22
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:23,179
you find Daniel and go one more, you'll find Hosea. Hosea chapter 7. And we're

23
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:33,179
going to begin our reading in verse 8. Hosea 7 and verse 8. And there the

24
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:44,380
scripture says this. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people. Ephraim

25
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:52,580
is a cake not turned. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it

26
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:02,820
not. Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. And the

27
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,699
pride of Israel testifieth to his face, and they do not return to the Lord their

28
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:17,779
God, nor seek him for all this. Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart.

29
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:25,179
They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. When they shall go, I will spread my net

30
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:32,539
upon them. I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven. I will chastise them

31
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:40,419
as their congregation hath heard. Woe unto them, for they have fled from me.

32
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:47,300
Destruction unto them, because they have transgressed against me, though I have

33
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,619
redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. And they have not cried unto

34
00:03:54,619 --> 00:04:02,020
me with their heart. When they howl upon their beds, they assemble themselves for

35
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:11,220
corn and wine, and they rebel against me. Let's pray and ask God's help. Father,

36
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,979
we're so grateful for this time that you've given us tonight. I thank you, Lord,

37
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:21,859
for these that have gathered and sang, and just the blessing the music is. I

38
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:26,899
thank you for those that are listening by the way of livestream. And Lord, we

39
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,779
understand this is not how we would have chosen to do this meeting or to meet

40
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:36,820
together, but it is what you've allowed, it's what you've given us, and so we're

41
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,059
grateful for that. And we pray that, Lord, you would use these moments in our life

42
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:52,339
and use your word and speak to us. Lord, we are so quick to complain, we are so

43
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:59,859
quick to indict the world, and it is indictable. But Father, what about

44
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:07,500
ourselves? And the truth is, if the world is ever going to see you, they're going

45
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,140
to have to see you through our testimony, through our lives. They're going to have

46
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:20,059
to hear our words, and our words will need the influence of a right life and

47
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:25,299
fellowship with you. And so I pray that we would think about these things

48
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:31,820
tonight, not looking at our brother or sister, not looking at those in the world

49
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,500
which we so easily condemn, but looking at ourselves. I pray it in Jesus' name.

50
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,260
Amen. I want to preach tonight on this thought. I have a lot of experience with

51
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:53,739
this. Gray hairs. If you notice in verse 9, again, it says, strangers have devoured

52
00:05:53,739 --> 00:06:01,899
his strength, and he knoweth it not, yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him,

53
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:09,459
yet he knoweth not. A lot of times in the Bible, perhaps most of the time in the

54
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:15,579
Bible, when you hear gray hairs, you see that phrase or something akin to it, what

55
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:22,059
we're talking about is the wisdom that experience brings, the blessing that

56
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:28,500
age can be, because it allows us to have experienced those things and understood

57
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,299
their blessings or consequences, and then be able to communicate to younger

58
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:42,660
people what they need to know and how they should react if they face that same

59
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,579
situation. And by the way, we live in a generation where gray-headed, the hoary

60
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:55,100
head, is disrespected. It's almost as if it's old, you throw it away, when in truth,

61
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,299
biblically, there is tremendous wisdom and blessing in hearing the advice of

62
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:07,100
those that are older than us, and those that have experienced life, and we are

63
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,220
just getting ready to experience it. But to be honest with you, in our passage

64
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,299
tonight, gray hair is not referring to the blessing of age and wisdom, it's

65
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:23,739
referring to something quite different, and in our text tonight, it is

66
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:32,179
referring to decay. The gray hair not only can demonstrate wisdom from

67
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:39,260
experience, it's gray because it is in a process of decay. I hate to admit this

68
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,859
about myself, but I can't do what I used to do, and just about everything on

69
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:52,739
me hurts at one point through the day. My good friend, Dr. Don Sisk, told me one

70
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:59,980
time, he said, Mike, after 70, if you wake up and something doesn't hurt, you didn't

71
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,100
actually wake up. And I think there's truth to that. You know, no matter how we

72
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:14,140
try to put it off, here's the truth. Each and every one of us were born to die, and

73
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:21,980
and our journey through this life is a journey that takes us from dust back to

74
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,299
dust. And I'm not trying to be discouraging to you tonight, I'm trying

75
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:32,219
to be realistic with you that our lives are going to experience decay, and

76
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,419
the truth is, the day is going to come, if Jesus does not come first, that I'm

77
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,739
going to die, and I'm going to be in the presence of the Lord through that

78
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:50,700
experience of death. And I can take vitamins, and I can try to eat

79
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,539
better than I do, and do all that I can to prolong it and to keep

80
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,859
strength in it, but I don't care what I do, and I don't care what vitamins I take,

81
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:12,460
I am decaying and moving towards death. Are you encouraged yet? No. But what is

82
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:20,260
true of my physical life does not have to be true of my spiritual life. And I

83
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:27,380
can be as vibrant and as vital for God the day that he takes me home as I was

84
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,539
the day that he saved my soul and put something in me that I'd never

85
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:39,659
experienced before. I may not be able to do all the things in ministry that I

86
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:46,380
once could do, but I can have influence, I can make a difference, I can be used of

87
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,340
the Lord up until the very day that he takes me out of this world. And I know

88
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,260
that you feel the same way that I do. I don't want to be a statistic, I don't

89
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,940
want to be

90
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,340
one of those people who used to. I don't want to be one of those folks

91
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,460
who once had a ministry, or once cared about the way I lived my life, or once

92
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,820
cared about the influence of the Spirit in and through my life. I want to have a

93
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:27,860
fire and a passion for serving the Lord until God takes me out. And to be honest

94
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,300
with you, if I'm going to do that, then I am going to have to pay attention to what

95
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,260
Hosea speaks to the nation of the northern nation of Israel about in this

96
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,180
passage. Because he says, Israel Ephraim, and understand Hosea was a prophet to

97
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,500
the northern kingdom of the ten tribes that had their capital in

98
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,140
Samaria, and God is trying to reach out to them. God is trying to bring them home

99
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,340
and bring them back, and Hosea preaches to them, and he says to them, Ephraim,

100
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,580
Israel, I see something about you, and what I see about you is that there are

101
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:17,700
gray hairs of decay in your spiritual life, and you're not even aware that

102
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,300
they're there. You know that you and I can be the very same way. What we so

103
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,500
easily see in others, we don't see in ourselves. What we so easily condemn in

104
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,779
others, we barely recognize in ourselves. And I think this message tonight will

105
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:44,380
confront us with the gray hairs, the spiritual gray hairs that are in our

106
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,500
life. Let me give four of them to you. Number one, there is what Hosea

107
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:58,580
identifies, as I call it, the gray hair of false testimony. The gray hair of

108
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:06,740
false testimony. I take you to verse 8. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the

109
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:16,580
people. Ephraim is a cake not turned. Again, Ephraim is referenced to the ten

110
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,300
tribes who were the nation of Samaria, or Israel, if you will, and Hosea

111
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,300
preaching to them says, listen, you know what you are, Israel? You know what you

112
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,860
are, Ephraim? You are a cake not turned. Now let me unpack that just a little bit.

113
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:41,580
In Bible times, in these days, they did not have convection ovens. They didn't

114
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,339
have our wonderful appliances in our kitchens that circulate the air so

115
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:55,100
that no matter where that loaf is placed, it has an even heat all around it.

116
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,139
They had, if they were wealthy, they had a stone oven. If they were not wealthy,

117
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,619
they had a hot rock or maybe a cooking pot of some kind. And when they fashioned

118
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:12,300
that loaf and were going to cook that loaf for their family or for their shop,

119
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,619
it was attendant upon them that one person, the baker, be there to constantly

120
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:27,619
turn that stone. Because there wasn't circulating air, it was extremely hot on

121
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:33,979
the stone and much, much cooler all around it. If you put that in there and

122
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,220
didn't pay attention to it, you had a very lovely brown bottom to the loaf. But

123
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,300
when you opened that loaf or cut into that loaf or bit into that loaf, you

124
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,339
found that what looked done on the bottom was mush on the inside, and it was

125
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:57,940
not worth eating. It couldn't be eaten. And what Hosea is saying to Israel is

126
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:09,220
this, you are not on the inside what you profess to be on the outside. You may

127
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,500
have a brown crust that looks inviting, but when we get inside you, when we get

128
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,580
into the heart of Ephraim, we realize that the appearance is not what is

129
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:31,059
actually going on inside. And I fear for our churches, I fear for Christians

130
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:40,580
today. We have been affected by wanting to look good and satisfied if people

131
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,779
think we are something, even if we are not actually that something in our

132
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:52,160
hearts. I want people to think I'm a good man. I want people to look at me and

133
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,799
think, boy, that's a guy who really loves the Lord. I want to be well thought of.

134
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,679
Hey, have you ever noticed our social media? Nobody ever shows their bad day.

135
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,440
Everything is about their good day. Everything is about the good part of

136
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,040
their lives, and it is very rare for them to portray what the rest of life

137
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,959
actually is. We have in our news right now this tragic case of this young lady

138
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,559
who was found murdered after being on this cross-country trip with her fiance.

139
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,720
I don't understand the parenting that would allow that, but they allowed that,

140
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,160
and every picture that they posted on their social media was a picture of

141
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,040
absolute perfection. It was just joy. It was everything you would have ever

142
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,360
dreamed, and I'm sure that people that looked at it, young people especially,

143
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:55,279
said, man, someday I'd like to have that. And then the veneer is pulled back, and

144
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,320
we find out that there's fighting, and tears, and anger, and anger to the point

145
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,080
where this young lady is murdered. And so all I'm saying is, is that what it

146
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,839
appeared to be was not what it actually was, and I have a great fear that we have

147
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,799
churches across America, even churches like our churches, where people are

148
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:28,360
satisfied to be well thought of and have a good appearance, even if the heart is

149
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:36,720
not the picture as presented on the outside. I had in our church that I

150
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,600
pastored for so long, my office was on the second floor, and I had a window that

151
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
looked out over the parking lots. And one of my favorite things, it's strange,

152
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
but one of my favorite things was just to watch families come to church. I'd

153
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,920
watch them drive in, they'd get out of the car, the husband would have his Bible,

154
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,559
the wife would have three car carriers, and 12 kids, and nine Bibles, and bags.

155
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,440
You know, I'd go down and preach on men helping their wives. But one thing I

156
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,119
observed for months, and it was a man who would pull into the parking lot, the very

157
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,600
front, his family would get out, no problem, they would come in the front

158
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,799
door, and he would walk all the way down the parking lot, all the way around to

159
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,640
the back door, and come in the back. It didn't matter if it was a hundred and

160
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,799
five degrees, it didn't matter if it was ten below, it didn't matter if it was

161
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,920
sunshine or rain, he did the same thing every Sunday. And I thought, that's so

162
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:40,920
strange. And so one day, naive, innocent me, I went to him and I said, why do

163
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,160
you let your family off, park there, and walk all the way around? And here's what

164
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,880
he said to me, well preacher, you just have to understand that so-and-so is a

165
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,320
greeter at that front door, and I don't like him. And there's just something

166
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,040
that we've got between us, and I just don't want to look at him, I don't want

167
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:12,320
to shake his hand. And I thought to myself, you sing in our choir, you say

168
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:20,880
amen when I preach. And here's the truth, I know it's not the greatest sin in all

169
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,320
the world, I know it may not in our hearts and minds compare to what this

170
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,679
young man we think has done to this young lady, but it is a picture of what

171
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,640
we so often are. We profess to be right with God, we profess to be walking with

172
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,280
God, we profess to be close to God, and we do the right things, and we sing the

173
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,559
hymns, and we know the words, and we carry a King James, and we say amen where we're

174
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,799
supposed to say amen, and we come to three to thrive, we do all of that stuff,

175
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:05,479
and we carry garbage in our heart, and wonder why we don't have revival, and

176
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:12,159
wonder why we don't have influence to win people to Christ. That's an example.

177
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:20,220
It could be a thousand things. Every Saturday morning at our church, we had

178
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,700
men's prayer meeting at 730. I don't think everybody has to do that, it's what we did.

179
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,500
And as part of that, I would take my boys when they were old enough to go, and we

180
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,140
would get in the car, and we'd go to prayer meeting, they would pray with

181
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,739
other men, pray with me, pray with boys. I just wanted to have the experience of

182
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:41,659
praying with good men. And after prayer meeting was over, we'd have donuts and

183
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:46,460
coffee, and we'd go back home, and on our way between the house and the church was

184
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,140
a 7-eleven. And everybody knows what's in 7-eleven, slurpees and coffee are in

185
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,220
7-eleven. So when we would go home, I'd stop almost every Saturday and say, guys

186
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,099
get get a candy bar, get a slurpee, I'll get a cup of coffee, and I'll take you

187
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,020
home, and then I'm gonna...

188
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,900
gonna go soul winning.

189
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,900
But outside that 7-Eleven, there was a perfect oak tree.

190
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,540
It reminds me a great deal of this oak tree

191
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,640
sitting down in front of the parsonage.

192
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,300
And I would take my boys when they had their slurpees

193
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,660
and I had my coffee, just, there was a picnic table

194
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,700
over there and we'd sit down for just a moment.

195
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,380
I can remember 25 times saying to my boys,

196
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,780
hey guys, your dad wants to be like this oak tree.

197
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,460
I wanna be strong, I wanna be a place where people

198
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,780
can have refuge, where they can feel secure.

199
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,120
I wanna be symmetrical, I just wanna be strong

200
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,540
like this oak tree.

201
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,420
And then I'd say, guys, I want you to be strong

202
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,620
like this oak tree.

203
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,580
I'll never forget one morning, we came around the corner,

204
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,960
there'd been a windstorm.

205
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,900
And the windstorm or the lightning had hit that tree

206
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,860
and it had split four different directions

207
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,340
and there was nothing inside the bark.

208
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,000
It was rotten to the core.

209
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,820
Well, I pulled my car in that place and called my assistant,

210
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,460
said I won't be at men's prayer meeting this morning,

211
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,300
I gotta take care of something with my boys,

212
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,760
please take that.

213
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,020
And I pulled them over, we went over to that tree

214
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,580
and not angrily, but I said to them, guys,

215
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,440
I don't ever want to be like this oak tree.

216
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,720
And I never want you to be like this oak tree.

217
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,420
I don't want to be one of those who sets themselves forth

218
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,220
as something they are not.

219
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,700
I want it to be real.

220
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,160
I want it to be real on the outside

221
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,180
and I want it to be real on the inside.

222
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,980
I want you to know that what your dad says he is.

223
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,180
And that's the kind of man I want you to be.

224
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,460
I'm not trying to be harsh.

225
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,740
But I'm telling you, our churches are filled with people

226
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,920
that are satisfied to carry a grudge,

227
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,380
that say amen to portions of the scripture

228
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,780
that they have no intention of being obedient to

229
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,020
in their lives, that understand what the Bible says

230
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,940
about the home and have no sense of instituting

231
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,700
those things in their home, in their lives.

232
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,940
And it's a gray hair.

233
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,820
And I'm telling you that when we are satisfied,

234
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,220
you say, well, preacher, everybody has something.

235
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,100
Yes, we do.

236
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,500
All of us have something in our lives

237
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,340
that isn't the way it should be.

238
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,340
My fear is this, is that when we are satisfied

239
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,820
for it to be that way,

240
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,820
when we will come into church, when we will hear preaching,

241
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,460
when we will sense from the Holy Spirit

242
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,300
that he wants us to deal with that,

243
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,400
and our reaction is, this is just how I am.

244
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,820
And we're willing to stay that way.

245
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,000
You say, well, preacher, I've been saved 30 years.

246
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,660
I've been saved 40 years.

247
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Hey, listen, to accept without caring sin in our lives

248
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,140
is not a sign of maturity.

249
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,660
It's a sign of backsliding, of being away from the Lord.

250
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,380
And so I say to you, Hosea looked at Ephraim

251
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,340
and he said, you're not what you say you are.

252
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,380
You give the appearance of one thing on the outside,

253
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,100
but when I get into there, you're not worshiping Jehovah.

254
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,860
You're chasing idols.

255
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,460
You're as pagan as the ones that live around you,

256
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,260
but you're trying to present yourself

257
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
as God's people, Jeroboam.

258
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,540
The gray hair of false testimony.

259
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,900
Here's number two.

260
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,620
Not only the gray hair of false testimony,

261
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,700
but the gray hair of a fruitless life.

262
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,140
Look at verse nine again.

263
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,860
Strangers have devoured his strength.

264
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
He knoweth it not.

265
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon the face of the earth

266
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,660
and gray hairs are here and there upon him,

267
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,860
yet he knoweth not.

268
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,740
What an arresting statement that is in verse nine.

269
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not.

270
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,220
Can I help us understand that a consistent theme

271
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,980
in the word of God is that the loss of God's power

272
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,900
is rarely obvious and violent.

273
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,900
It is more often a subtle process of decay.

274
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,580
We just let it happen.

275
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,140
Or we go through the motions.

276
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,300
We continue to do what we used to do.

277
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,300
We just don't have the influence that we used to have.

278
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,180
Samson stood up one day after having for years

279
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,420
thrown off his attackers.

280
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,260
Oh, he had led a loose life.

281
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,020
He had been disobedient to parents,

282
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,700
disobedient to the Lord,

283
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,860
but he just assumed that he could always

284
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,780
throw off the attackers.

285
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,300
But one day he stood up and he didn't, he wist not,

286
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,300
he didn't even know the spirit had departed.

287
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,220
King Saul remained king long after God

288
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,580
had removed his hand.

289
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,500
That's startling to me.

290
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,740
He was king.

291
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,340
He commanded the armies,

292
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,700
but God had long ago anointed another to be king

293
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,020
and God's hand had been removed from Saul.

294
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,020
Oh, he went through the motions, but the power was gone.

295
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,380
Did you know that it was a full year

296
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,300
from David's sin with Bathsheba

297
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,500
before Nathan the prophet came in and confronted him

298
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,140
and David admitted, I am the man.

299
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,980
You're right.

300
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,900
And for a full year, he kept singing his Psalms.

301
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,180
And for a full year, he kept going to worship at the temple.

302
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,860
And for a full year, he paraded before his armies.

303
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,420
And for a full year,

304
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,100
he acted like the sweet singer of Israel.

305
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,820
And all the time during that year,

306
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,860
what the Bible tells us is he was eaten up inside.

307
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,300
But he went through the motions.

308
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,580
I'm just telling you that Ichabod was written

309
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,580
over the temple long before services stopped in the temple.

310
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,740
The truth is we're able to go through the motions.

311
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,580
I wonder how many Sunday school lessons are taught

312
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,900
with no real sense of God's power and God's blessing on.

313
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,780
I wonder how many sermons are preached in pulpits

314
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,300
where there is no true sense of God's power and blessing.

315
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,420
Hey, listen, I know how to write three points in a poem.

316
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,820
I know how to do this and do this.

317
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,340
I can go through the motions.

318
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,060
But going through the motions

319
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,700
does not bring the power of God.

320
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,940
And here's the truth.

321
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,820
If we're going to see where we are,

322
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,220
it is not in the sense of, do I do what I used to do?

323
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,380
It is in the small things that only we notice in our heart.

324
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,900
Let me tell you two things.

325
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,260
How do you tell if the influence and the power

326
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,460
of the Spirit is slipping out of your life?

327
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,300
Two things.

328
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Number one, you'll begin to notice

329
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,740
a lack of appetite for what is good.

330
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,920
You'll begin to notice that your appetite

331
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,460
for what is good is changing.

332
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,740
I think I was telling preacher today,

333
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,140
I remember when I first got saved

334
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,340
and I was finding verses like John 3.16.

335
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,820
I know this may be amazing to you,

336
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,500
but as a 23-year-old man, I never saw it.

337
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,020
I never knew it.

338
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,840
And I found it and I thought, the world's gotta know this.

339
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,620
They don't know this.

340
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,620
And I would go into the factory and I would tell people,

341
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,820
hey, God so loved the world,

342
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,300
and they'd look back at me and say,

343
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,220
yeah, yeah, everybody knows that preacher.

344
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,700
We learned that in Sunday school.

345
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,540
They would call me Preacher Edwards.

346
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,580
I can remember every time I opened the Word of God,

347
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,660
God would speak to me.

348
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,179
God would show me something.

349
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:42,100
I can remember when I would pray and be startled,

350
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,780
startled when God answered exactly what I asked him to do.

351
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,480
And I ask us tonight,

352
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,500
when's the last time God showed you something

353
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,179
in his Word for you?

354
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,900
When's the last time there was that sweet desire

355
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,619
to meet with him over his Word

356
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,619
and to tarry with him in prayer?

357
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,520
When's the last time, not generally speaking,

358
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,260
but specific to your life that you can say,

359
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,500
hey, God showed me this.

360
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,980
God spoke to me about this.

361
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,300
God did this in answer to my prayer.

362
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,900
You'll notice that the services of church

363
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,340
are not near as exciting as they once were.

364
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,340
As a matter of fact, they almost have to be endured.

365
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,980
Well, I remember when I got saved,

366
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,580
and I keep saying that like I don't now.

367
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,059
I am passionate about preaching, not just my preaching.

368
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,100
But I see so many folks who were on fire

369
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,940
for a year or two or three,

370
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,420
and then you look at their life as they move down the road,

371
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,860
and now it's as if,

372
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,179
when are they gonna get done?

373
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,980
You say, well, preacher, everybody's.

374
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,500
got stuff to do. I realize everybody's got stuff to do, but I'm telling you

375
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
there was a time in your life when you didn't look at your watch. There was a

376
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,480
time in your life where you hung on every word. You say, well, for good

377
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:25,460
preachers, you're just not a good preacher. Hey, it's God's Word. And I'm

378
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:32,400
asking you, you know, we've been in a strange time of history. You know what my

379
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:41,760
great fear is? That folks have gotten used to not going to church and they

380
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,920
think, well, I can sit here and be comfortable. I'm not faulting you. I know

381
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,880
that this is a special circumstance in this church. Please don't hear that as

382
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,360
condemnation. But across America, folks, probably around 70% of people have come

383
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,960
back to church. There's 30% of people that may use COVID as an excuse,

384
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,600
but are not motivated enough to come back to church. You know what that is?

385
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,720
That is a gray hair. You say, well, I've heard preaching for a long time, preacher.

386
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,680
Oh, so you've matured to where you don't need it? Because the Apostle Paul said, I

387
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,240
remember him saying something like this, that he had not yet apprehended that

388
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:33,120
for which he was apprehended, and he was pressing toward the mark. And there was

389
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,320
no time in that great man's life where he said, I'm gonna put it in neutral, and I

390
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:49,720
don't need much anymore. Complacency is overtaking our churches. And I'm

391
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,520
suggesting to you that if you have a sense of that in your heart, that's not

392
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:06,240
growth. That's a problem. And ask God's help to deal with it. Service is forsaken.

393
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:14,720
People don't sing anymore. Soul winning? What's that? Witnessing? That's something

394
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,640
you do in a foreign country. Hey, not only do we start to lose our taste for

395
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,040
that which is good, we start to gain a taste for that which is bad. We become

396
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,560
content with a lower standard of Christian living. The shows we would have

397
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,400
never watched, we now watch. The things we would have never chuckled about,

398
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,680
sometimes we think, well, maybe that's a little funny. We become flippant about

399
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,360
faithfulness. We become flippant about sin. We become indifferent to conviction.

400
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,200
And I'm just asking you, take a look at your heart. Don't look at me. Don't look

401
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,080
at someone else. Don't think about your husband, or your wife, or your kids, or

402
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:10,680
your parents. What about you? And has there been that subtle change in your

403
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:18,000
love for that which is good, in your disdain for that which is evil? And if so,

404
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,360
admit it to yourself, and ask the Spirit of God's help, help me to pluck that gray

405
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:35,280
hair. Here's number three. The gray hair of callousness. Look at verse 10.

406
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,600
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face, and they do not return to the

407
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:49,800
Lord their God, nor seek him for all this. God spoke to them. They knew what God was

408
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:57,160
saying to them, but their pride would not let them get it right. And so God could

409
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,800
speak, and what used to be convicting to them was no longer convicting to

410
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:10,040
them. You see, sin makes us insensitive. And one of the greatest fears I have for

411
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,520
our country, oh you say, well it must be this party, or that party, oh it must be

412
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,040
this bill, or that bill, must be this election, or that election. No! The

413
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,440
greatest fear I have for our nation is we are becoming churches of dry eyes and

414
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:38,440
empty altars. Dry eyes, empty altars. You say preacher, I used to when you would

415
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,680
preach on that, boy God would get a hold of my heart, and I was under conviction.

416
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,680
But to be honest with you preacher, I've heard you preach on that so much, and

417
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,000
I've heard a lot better preachers than you preach on that, and to be honest with

418
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,760
you, it used to bother me, but it doesn't bother me. Oh, you've matured? No. When we

419
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,320
can ignore the convicting hand of the Holy Spirit, that's not maturity. So often

420
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,320
people will say to me, hey you know preacher, I've served, and I've done this,

421
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,560
and I've done that, I've done it for years, let somebody else do it for a while.

422
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:25,080
That is not growth in your Christian life! And may God touch our hearts, and

423
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,880
help us to see that whether we're sitting in our living room, or family

424
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,200
room, or kitchen table listening to this on livestream, or whether we're sitting

425
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,360
in this room tonight, or wherever we are, that if the Holy Spirit of God will come

426
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,600
down and and love us so much, that he will walk this aisle, or come to our aisle,

427
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,480
and speak to our heart, and say that's you, you've grown calloused. You don't

428
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,720
want to go forward because you don't want anybody to think less of you. That

429
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,440
takes us back to the first one, where we want everybody to think we've got it

430
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,040
squared away. When we know we don't, and we know in our heart that we're

431
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,480
disappointing, we're not pleasing to the Lord in some area in our life, and oh my,

432
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,520
when God's Holy Spirit will speak to us that way, there is but one answer that

433
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,200
should come from us, yes God, yes God, yes God. And I don't care who sees it, and I

434
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,040
don't care who knows it, God you're right, I'm not where I used to be, I'm not where

435
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,640
I once was, and I've become comfortable with being away from where I

436
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,760
used to be, and need to be, and I don't want to be troubled with it, and that's

437
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,360
exactly where Ephraim was, and so God would speak to him, and speak to him, and

438
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,640
speak to him, and their pride would be a stone face, and their heart was callous,

439
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,720
and they would not respond. There's a fourth hair, a gray hair, notice it in

440
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:13,600
verse 11, Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart, they call to Egypt,

441
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,400
and they go to Assyria, the hair of silliness.

442
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,440
Hosea says, you ever seen a dove? A dove is always flitting around, very nervous,

443
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,680
always flitting around, going from this, to this, to this, to this, to that, and you

444
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:41,000
know what Christians, I think in our day, could be described as, as silly. You see,

445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,120
I think so many have come to the place where our callousness has, has not allowed

446
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:55,480
God to speak to us, and so we sense that we're not where we are, ought to be, we

447
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,560
sense that we don't have the influence, we don't have the same measure of the

448
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,200
Spirit's power and influence that we once had, and you know what that must be?

449
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:13,840
That must be the preacher's fault. He looked at Ephraim and he said, you, you're

450
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,600
God's people, and you are looking for help from Egypt. What is wrong with your

451
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,680
thinking? You are running to Egypt because you need help, because you're

452
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,440
under attack, and you're asking, where is it? When did you start doing that? Do

453
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,440
you remember when you came to me and I answered and deliver you? Not only did

454
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,320
they go to Egypt, they went to Assyria. Hey Assyria, can you help us? You know why

455
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,560
they did that? Because they had no communication with the Lord. And today I

456
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:58,200
see it in churches all across America, preacher. You know what we need? We need a

457
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,880
new style of music, that's what we need. If we had a new style of music, the

458
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,240
Spirit would descend upon this place and, whoo, we'd have a full house, it'd be

459
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,600
great. Hey preacher, you know what we need? We need a new version of the Bible,

460
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,040
because we need a Bible that we can read and, and in our words, hey preacher, you

461
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,600
know what we need? We need a new you. Yeah. Preacher, you just don't feed us.

462
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Preacher, you just don't this. On and on and we go from this, to this, to this, to

463
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,440
that, and you know why? Because we don't come down here. Because the altar is no

464
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,400
longer the answer to our hearts. Because repentance and getting right with God

465
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,040
is no longer the answer. Notice what he says in verse 14, they have not cried

466
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:59,800
unto me from their heart. Oh, they howl on their beds, they assemble themselves for

467
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,000
corn and wine, but they rebel against me.

468
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,980
me. Now I'm finished but here's my point. These things are progressive. When we are

469
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:23,040
willing to be on the outside to appear to be something we are not really on the

470
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:32,160
inside, I'm telling you it's the first step to a fruitless life. A life where we

471
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,560
become contented with doing less, with being less, with caring less about the

472
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,320
good and entertaining more of the evil. And then it leads to a callous life

473
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,800
because we no longer want to be bothered. Well we'll go through the motions, we'll

474
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,960
do what we do because we want people to think we are solid Christians and we

475
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,720
want people to think we are involved and we've got it all squared away but we

476
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,800
just notice that we're not bearing fruit like we once did. Our devotions

477
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,500
aren't deep like they once were. Our heart is not seeing answered prayer like

478
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:18,560
it once did and and we notice that we're becoming okay with that. We're just not

479
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,000
tore up about not having that close walk with the Lord and I'm telling you before

480
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,960
very long we think the answer is somewhere else and it's someone else's fault. I don't

481
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,240
know about you, I suspect I do, that you think exactly like I do in the sense

482
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,520
that I don't want to be a statistic. I don't want to be that one who once

483
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,320
walked with God but now does not have power with God or influence with God. I

484
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,760
don't want to be that one who once had a heart that sought him and wanted to

485
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,440
know him and wanted to be changed from the inside out. I don't want to go to

486
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,200
where I'm just complacent and I'm satisfied with where I am and feel no

487
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:16,520
need to change. No, I want to be the kind of person that is always watching me. I

488
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:24,640
want to watch me and Holy Spirit I'm giving you entrance to my life and I'm

489
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:32,320
asking you will you expose to me those gray hairs that will lead to a place

490
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:40,840
where I am somebody who used to, where I'm somebody that you could have used

491
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,760
but not now. I don't want to get to the place where I don't have influence

492
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,800
for you and and where I'm just one of those guys, you know, he says he's a

493
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:00,200
Christian. God help us to see that revival does not start in Congress.

494
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Revival doesn't even start in this church. It starts in me. It starts in my

495
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,840
heart when I'm willing to say to the Lord, you're right and there are things

496
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,160
that need to be adjusted in my walk with you and I don't care who thinks of ill

497
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,800
of me. I don't care if it dashes somebody's concept of who I am. I know

498
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:34,680
I'm not what I need to be. I'm not saying I'm in deep sin. I just know I've moved

499
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,600
and it's not growth. Would you pray with me?

500
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,240
Fathers, we come to you tonight. I pray for everyone in this room. I pray for

501
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,840
everyone who is so patiently and graciously listened to me on live

502
00:43:52,840 --> 00:44:02,400
stream and I pray that you would right now, Holy Spirit, speak to us. Would you

503
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,720
speak to us about the grudge that is in our heart, the bitterness that we hold,

504
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:20,400
the anger that no one except those who are closest to us sense and hear? Would

505
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,560
you talk to us about the things that we think no other eyes see but our hearts

506
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,840
are even now convicting us about? We do them in the dark. But Father, they come

507
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:40,840
between you and us and we want to be well thought of and we we try to keep

508
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,040
the image and the appearance up, but in our hearts we know we're not where we

509
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:55,160
need to be. And Lord, we know that in our bearing fruit, not only souls, but in our

510
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,760
becoming Christ-like and bearing the fruit of the Spirit, we are not where we

511
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:12,440
once were. And Lord, if we're complacent and satisfied to stay there, we'll build

512
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:19,880
callous upon callous upon callous upon our hearts. And where once we could be

513
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,960
convicted and where once we had a tender heart, we'll become scoffers. We'll

514
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,200
kind of chuckle that, yeah, I used to get upset about that. And think we have grown,

515
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:41,400
think we've become more mature, when in truth we've just become hardened. And

516
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,640
there'll be a day when we need you. There'll be a day when we wish we had the

517
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:56,800
influence we once had, the relationship, the closeness. But we might well become

518
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,080
silly and think that it's somebody else's fault or think if we could just

519
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,280
add something from the world to our lives. That would be the answer. We just

520
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:14,040
need to go to a new church, one that thinks like we do. So Lord, if there's

521
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:23,440
going to be revival, it needs to start in hearts like ours, in weeks like this,

522
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:32,600
where we just give you the time to speak. And so I pray for every heart in living

523
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,080
rooms and dining rooms, wherever they are, Lord, would you touch their heart

524
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,760
right now and help them to get up out of that chair, perhaps kneel and make their

525
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,320
sofa, their altar. I don't care if their wife will have questions or their husband

526
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:54,000
will have questions, tell them the truth. Something between me and you. Nothing

527
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,280
between is what we sing. Do we mean it or is that a false appearance? Lord, I pray

528
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,280
that you would speak to our hearts about our changing appetite for that which is

529
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,440
good. And God, break our hearts about our changing acceptance of that which is

530
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:25,560
evil. Most of all, God, I pray that you would pierce our hard, calloused hearts.

531
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:33,640
What a privilege it is to have the Spirit of God care enough about us that

532
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,920
he would speak to us. So Lord, would you work in this preacher's heart? Everything

533
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,840
I said tonight can be true in my life. And would you change us? I pray in Jesus'

534
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,680
name, amen.
