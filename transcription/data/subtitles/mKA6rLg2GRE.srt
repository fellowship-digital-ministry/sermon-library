1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Evening, Genesis chapter 50, and tonight we'll be looking at verses 15 through 21.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,199
Genesis 50, 15 through 21.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:13,760
In the midst of our text this evening, Joseph makes a statement that is quite familiar to

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
many of us.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,920
In fact, part of Genesis chapter number 50 is often quoted by God's people.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,959
The part that's often quoted is,

7
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:27,479
Ye thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,840
That's not the whole verse, but that's the part that often is quoted.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,319
I've used that part of the verse or part of that statement, God meant it unto good, as

10
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:40,279
our title for our message this evening.

11
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:46,799
As you recall from our message last Sunday evening, Jacob's final request, we understood

12
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,319
that the request was given, the request was granted after Jacob died at the end of chapter

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,400
49.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,180
We find that the process of mourning was fulfilled, and then Joseph and his brothers,

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,319
they took a journey in order to bury their father, Jacob, in the place specifically that

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,800
he had given to them that he desired to be buried.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,360
The Bible told us in verse 14, as we finished up the text last Sunday night, that Joseph

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,760
returned into Egypt.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,040
He and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father, and after he had buried

20
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:28,400
his father, so they now returned to Egypt, Jacob, as we mentioned, was buried according

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,400
to his desire, and I think that the trip back to Egypt brought some mixed emotions to Joseph's

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
brothers.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,760
As we begin our text of Scripture this evening, beginning in verse number 15, we see that

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,639
God gives us immediately some insight with regard to the conversation that takes place

25
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,680
amongst Joseph's brothers.

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,519
Notice in verse 15, the Bible says, "...and when Joseph's brethren saw that their father

27
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:03,680
was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,279
the evil which we did unto him.

29
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:15,520
They sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying..."

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,559
This is all fabricated, you understand that.

31
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:21,119
This is not actually what Jacob had commanded.

32
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:25,839
It says, "...so shall you say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of

33
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:29,000
thy brethren and their sin.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,279
For they did unto the evil, and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants

35
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,199
of the God of thy father.

36
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:42,160
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him, and his brethren also went and fell down before

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,960
his face, and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,520
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not, for am I in the place of God.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,639
But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass

40
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,479
as it is this day, to save much people alive.

41
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,080
Now therefore, fear ye not, I will nourish you and your little ones.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,639
And he comforted them and spake kindly unto them."

43
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,839
If you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice, first of all, the concern of

44
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,940
Joseph's brethren.

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,800
The concern of Joseph's brethren.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,580
For many years, Joseph's brothers lived knowing what they had, how they had sinned against

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,779
their brother, the evil that they committed against Joseph.

48
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:31,179
They lived for many years trying to suppress all of that.

49
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:34,940
And we understand that as they went into Egypt, they did not recognize Joseph.

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,300
But on that first entrance into the country of Egypt to find sustenance for their families,

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,139
we find that Joseph recognized his brethren.

52
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,539
We find that it was a series of events that transpired with them needing to take another

53
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:55,500
journey into Egypt, and eventually Joseph would reveal himself to his brothers.

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,300
And we've made note, as we've studied through the portion of Scripture, that when Joseph

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,100
had the opportunity to reveal himself in Genesis chapter 45, that his brothers, they were troubled

56
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,619
at his presence.

57
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,419
Why is it that they were troubled at his presence?

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,899
Well, they knew all that they did, and they understood that now Joseph standing in this

59
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,380
place of authority and power, they were fearful of what Joseph would do.

60
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,660
And Joseph called them near to himself and he comforted them.

61
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,540
And the Bible says in verse 5 of Genesis 45, now therefore be not grieved nor angry with

62
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,739
yourselves that ye sold me hither.

63
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:40,640
Then notice he said, for God did send me before you to preserve life.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,720
He said, for these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,079
in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest.

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,519
And again in verse 7, and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth

67
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,239
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

68
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:04,559
Then notice verse number 8, so now it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

69
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:10,679
When we studied through Genesis 45, we made note with regard to the perspective that Joseph

70
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:17,160
had, and certainly had a proper perspective on life and understanding all that had transpired.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,600
As we come to Genesis chapter number 50, obviously many years have passed, it's in Genesis 46

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,320
that Jacob and the family all go into Egypt, and we understand that the Bible tells us

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,200
that Jacob was there for 17 years in the land of Egypt.

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,359
To the best of our knowledge, biblically speaking, what is revealed to us, there's

75
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:42,079
no time during those 17 years that anything with regard to past history is ever dealt

76
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,079
with.

77
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,040
It doesn't seem, it's never brought up in the dialogue that we read in the account of

78
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
the book of Genesis.

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,920
We find that there's 17 years there, all of those 17 years are not notated daily what

80
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,760
took place, but we do not have in Scripture of any record of these item, or these events

81
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,239
being discussed.

82
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:08,239
We find now that Jacob dies, Jacob is buried, and the brothers are concerned.

83
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,880
As we note the concern of Joseph's brethren, we see in verse number 15 what they thought.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,380
Notice with me again, the Bible says that they recognized that their father was dead,

85
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,959
so here's what they think, here's the conclusion that they reach.

86
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:29,839
In verse number 15 they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite

87
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,799
us all the evil which we did unto him.

88
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:41,339
They almost have this perspective, if you will, that Joseph has dealt kindly with us

89
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:48,000
over these past 17 years that we've lived in Egypt solely because of the fact that Jacob

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,320
was alive.

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,279
And because of dad's presence, because of dad being here, Joseph really didn't say anything,

92
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,119
he didn't do anything with regard to the evil that we did unto him.

93
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,200
So they begin to think as they're journeying back to Egypt, imagine with me on that journey

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,799
back to Egypt, and knowing that you've just buried your father, and they have this belief

95
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:18,920
that now Joseph is going to requite them all of the evil which they did unto him.

96
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,980
They're concerned.

97
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,140
We find that they devise a plan.

98
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,339
We notice what they thought, but then we see what they did.

99
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,859
They send a messenger with a message.

100
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:34,500
It seems as if, as you look at the text in verses 17 and 18, that they're there in the

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,779
presence of Joseph as this message is being delivered to Joseph.

102
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:46,100
And basically as Joseph is receiving this message, it reveals again to us the measure

103
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,500
of concern that these brothers have with regard to what would happen to them, revenge

104
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,980
if you will, because dad is gone.

105
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,420
And they acknowledge the evil that they did to Joseph.

106
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,019
So here's the message that they give the messenger to deliver in verse 17.

107
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:10,540
Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren and their sin.

108
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,820
For they did unto thee evil.

109
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:22,220
And now we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.

110
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,859
We find that they were seeking forgiveness.

111
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,779
They were seeking that they would not have retribution, that there'd be no revenge, that

112
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,140
there'd be no penalty if you would for that which they committed against Joseph.

113
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,140
And it's interesting because all the way back in Genesis 45, we mention the beautiful picture

114
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,119
of forgiveness.

115
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:48,080
We noted as we've looked at the names even of Joseph's children and how he mentions about

116
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,960
the way that God made him forget and God had blessed him, and understanding the fact that

117
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,479
Joseph was aware of God's plan.

118
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:02,320
Joseph was not allowing bitterness to have any place in his heart.

119
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,520
He was not angry with his brothers.

120
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,359
In fact, he forgave them and he had this restored relationship with them, but their concern

121
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:17,119
was that it was just kind of because dad was still there.

122
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:20,479
Now that dad's gone, how's Joseph really going to treat us?

123
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:26,400
But I want you to see that it was true forgiveness that Joseph had forgiven his brothers long

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,599
before this event in Genesis chapter 50.

125
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:35,940
In fact, the Bible says that Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

126
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,900
Joseph had already forgiven his brothers.

127
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,239
We mentioned about the beautiful picture of forgiveness.

128
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:46,859
We mentioned in previous messages with regard to the danger of bitterness, and in fact,

129
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:50,500
there are many people today that deal with bitterness and they have bitterness in their

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
heart.

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,500
And the reality is that Joseph was a man that he had learned to forgive.

132
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,859
His brothers, they were concerned.

133
00:09:58,859 --> 00:09:59,979
The Bible tells us that.

134
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:06,139
brothers after the messengers deliver the message and Joseph weeps that his brethren

135
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:14,379
they went and fell down before his face and notice what they say, we be thy servants.

136
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,339
We be thy servants.

137
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,139
They were concerned it would be far better for them to live and be the servants of Joseph

138
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,259
than to die for the evil which they had committed so many years prior.

139
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:33,499
So we note the concern of Joseph's brethren but I want you to note number two, the confidence

140
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,819
of Joseph.

141
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:39,939
In verses 19 and 20 we see a man who has great confidence.

142
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,939
Confidence in himself?

143
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,179
No, confidence in his God.

144
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,779
By the way, we ought to be confident knowing that our God is in control.

145
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:53,299
We ought to be confident knowing what God's plan is and that God has a plan that is greater

146
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:58,459
than any of us individually and that God will bring to pass that which he desires to

147
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:04,979
bring to pass and the process by which he chooses to bring those things to pass is completely

148
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,899
up to him and within his control.

149
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:14,339
We find that Joseph says this in verse number 19, he said unto them, fear not for am I in

150
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,339
the place of God.

151
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,619
I begin to think about the confidence of Joseph and I notice in verse number 19 that Joseph

152
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:25,219
knew who he was and he knew who God was.

153
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,019
I'm thankful to know who God is.

154
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,579
Aren't you thankful to know that God is on his throne, that God is sovereign, that God

155
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,259
is a good God?

156
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,459
We ought to know what our place is.

157
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,619
Joseph is not in the place, he is not God, he understands that God is far greater than

158
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,619
he is.

159
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:46,459
We think about what Isaiah says as God is making it clear, your ways are not my ways

160
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,299
and your thoughts are not my thoughts.

161
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,819
God transcends us.

162
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:57,859
We find here this evening that as we look at verse 19 that Joseph is understanding not

163
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,619
only who he is but he understands who God is.

164
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,859
I wonder this evening, do we have a proper view of who God is?

165
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,499
Do we see God in his rightful place?

166
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,979
Do we see God high, holy and lifted up?

167
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,179
Do we really believe that God is in control?

168
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,659
Do we really believe that God makes no mistakes?

169
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:21,099
Do we really believe that God's ways are perfect?

170
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:25,379
Because all of those things that I just mentioned are biblical truths that we find within his

171
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,379
word.

172
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:33,019
But the reality is that at some point in your life and in my life, the Bible truths need

173
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,819
to be lived out in our daily lives.

174
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,819
It cannot be that we only say that God is good when things are going according to the

175
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,379
way that we want them to be.

176
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:46,659
It cannot be that we can say that God's way is perfect so long as it aligns with what

177
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,979
my way is.

178
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,939
No, God's way is perfect.

179
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,619
God truly makes no mistakes.

180
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:54,619
Do you believe that this evening?

181
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,979
I believe that.

182
00:12:56,979 --> 00:13:02,059
And we find that Joseph had to understand this, this perspective, but he had great confidence.

183
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:07,539
And I wonder this evening how we do, how do we fare in the trials and the difficulties

184
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:10,259
in life and all that we deal with?

185
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:16,819
What is our confidence level with regard to understanding who God is?

186
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,179
Understanding that God has a plan.

187
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:25,059
See, my life is in God's hands and your life is in God's hands.

188
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:29,779
There are a lot of times in our lives that we might think that we're in control, that

189
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:37,499
we may think that we can go through life and we have the ability to manage various levels

190
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:46,619
of processes, but the reality is that our God alone is in control of all things.

191
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:51,739
Joseph continues to demonstrate his confidence in the Lord in verse number 20.

192
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:57,619
He says, but as for you, he looks at his brothers.

193
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:02,979
He says to them, ye thought evil against me.

194
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:05,499
Is that a true statement?

195
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,099
Absolutely.

196
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,219
They hated Joseph.

197
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:13,859
They could not speak peaceably unto Joseph.

198
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:25,099
They conspired to kill him and then chose to sell him into slavery instead of killing

199
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,819
him.

200
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:32,459
And Joseph says, ye thought evil against me.

201
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,779
And it could be in your life and in my life that we've had circumstances and situations

202
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,499
where people have thought evil against us.

203
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:53,659
They have planned and desired to cause great heartache and pain in your life.

204
00:14:53,659 --> 00:15:02,179
But notice that Joseph does not end by simply exposing the evil intent of his brothers.

205
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:10,179
He continues and says, but God meant it unto good.

206
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:13,779
Can I tell you this evening, this is not a cliche.

207
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:21,419
This is a man who has great confidence in knowing intimately his God, in knowing the

208
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:27,739
ways that his God works and understanding the fact that our God is a sovereign God,

209
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:33,179
that He is in control of the affairs of mankind.

210
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:39,059
And we find that as we come to a text of Scripture like this, that the Bible says, but God meant

211
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,619
it unto good.

212
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:50,499
And He continues to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive.

213
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:55,979
If you think about the statement that is made in Genesis chapter 50 and verse number 20,

214
00:15:55,979 --> 00:16:00,219
and you understand all that we have studied throughout these many weeks of looking at

215
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:04,979
the life of Joseph, we understand that all of those things that transpired were coming

216
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:11,659
to that very point where God would allow Joseph to have an audience before Pharaoh to interpret

217
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:17,899
a dream that could otherwise not be interpreted by any magician or any other wise man within

218
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:18,899
Egypt.

219
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,979
And Joseph not only was able by the grace of God and the ability of God to be able to

220
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:33,379
interpret the dream, but then give to Pharaoh a plan that would result in much people being

221
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,579
saved alive.

222
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:42,099
Otherwise, the great famine that would follow, the great years of plenty, would have had

223
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:50,539
a devastating impact on the population, not only in Egypt, but most especially in Canaan.

224
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:57,579
And so Joseph, when we know the confidence that he has in this text of Scripture, it

225
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,379
causes us to rejoice.

226
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:00,379
Why?

227
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,819
Because we can have confidence in who our God is.

228
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:10,019
We can be confident in knowing the plan that God has for your life and for my life.

229
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,699
Listen, Joseph did not have the Bible like we have the Bible.

230
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,499
You think about all that we have in this precious book and all that God has revealed to us,

231
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:27,299
that would help us to have confidence in knowing the plan that God has for us.

232
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,219
I want to draw your attention to two New Testament passages of Scripture.

233
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:35,019
First is in Romans chapter number 8.

234
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:41,259
Anytime you think of this passage here in Genesis chapter 50, often we would couple

235
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:46,499
it with the truth that we find in Romans chapter number 8.

236
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:52,059
It makes good sense to go from Genesis 50 to Romans chapter number 8 and to see the

237
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,979
connection between these two verses of Scripture.

238
00:17:55,979 --> 00:18:01,659
Joseph makes this great declaration revealing his confidence that he has in his God.

239
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:06,579
And we find that Paul writes, and he says this in Romans 8 and verse 28, and I like

240
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:11,379
the first words, and we know.

241
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:23,339
I'm not sure how often I've heard Romans 8.28 quoted without quoting it completely.

242
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:28,979
So often I've heard Romans 8.28, all things work together for good.

243
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:34,019
But the Bible says, and we know.

244
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,940
That's powerful.

245
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,459
How is it that we know?

246
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:45,459
Well, because God has revealed to us in His word, His character, His nature, who He is,

247
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,779
the plan that He has.

248
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,820
Does it mean that we're never going to have a difficult day?

249
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,019
No, it does not mean that whatsoever.

250
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,940
But we find that as we come to Romans chapter 8 and verse 28, the Bible says, and we know

251
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:05,339
that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called

252
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,940
according to His purpose.

253
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,779
What a precious verse of Scripture.

254
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,899
You say, well, this right here looks like a mess to me.

255
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,699
I don't know how anything good is going to come out of it.

256
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,979
You just keep trusting the Lord.

257
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,059
You just keep doing what's right, and you let God be God.

258
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,260
And do you think Joseph, for two years, he's left in the prison, right?

259
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Forgotten.

260
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,820
But God's timing was perfect.

261
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:38,099
God's plan was coming just as He had designed it to come.

262
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,099
We find that the Bible tells us that we know.

263
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:49,299
Do you have the confidence today, tonight, as you face the uncertain times that you face

264
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:55,899
in your life, that we face in our lives collectively, corporately, as a people, as a nation?

265
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:00,059
So often you will hear people make statements about various things.

266
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,679
And so long as the things are positive or to their liking,

267
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,399
they'll make statement with regard to God being in control

268
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:10,559
and God put that person there or God did this.

269
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,239
But when it doesn't fit what they want it to be

270
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,119
or what they think should be,

271
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,739
all of a sudden it's not God who put them there.

272
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,199
God is sovereign.

273
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,339
God is in control.

274
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,799
I can't tell you how many times, and I hate to bring it up,

275
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:32,119
I don't like dealing with so many political type of things

276
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,519
and you know that, but I can't tell you how many times

277
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,839
I heard we're getting ready to have another election cycle,

278
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,799
get ready for all of the rhetoric again.

279
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,399
But our hope is not in the White House.

280
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:42,319
You understand that?

281
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,439
Our hope is in Jesus.

282
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,279
Amen?

283
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,399
But so many people talking about stealing an election,

284
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,239
this, that, changing, so on and so forth.

285
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,839
Listen, God rules in the affairs of mankind.

286
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,839
And even if all of that stuff happened,

287
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,359
God allowed it to happen.

288
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,720
God allowed it to happen.

289
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,119
We either believe God's in control or we don't.

290
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,279
We either believe God's in control or we don't.

291
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,599
Plain and simple.

292
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,879
You can't have it that God's in control

293
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:18,559
so long as everything goes the way that you want it to go

294
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,879
and then all of a sudden God must not be in control

295
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,459
when it doesn't go the way that you want it to go.

296
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:24,559
Amen?

297
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,519
God's in control.

298
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,439
By the way, I'm thankful that God's in control

299
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,239
because God, he knows all things.

300
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:35,239
He is the only one that should be in control.

301
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,360
And we ought to readily allow him to have control.

302
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
Joseph had great confidence.

303
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,839
Let me take you to another New Testament verse of Scripture.

304
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,839
In 2 Corinthians chapter five,

305
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
we speak about having confidence

306
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,239
with regard to the affairs of life

307
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:52,439
and to the events that would transpire in your life

308
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,799
and in my life as we see it in Joseph's life

309
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,599
here in Genesis 50, as he's looking back

310
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,559
at those evil things that his brothers did to him.

311
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,279
But he says, God meant it unto good.

312
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,239
God had a plan.

313
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,239
God had a purpose.

314
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,880
God is sovereign and my life is in the hands of my God.

315
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,319
But I want you to notice when we think about

316
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,679
this subject of confidence,

317
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,520
I want you to see what Paul says

318
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
in 2 Corinthians chapter five with regard to confidence.

319
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,279
We sang this evening about the truth of Calvary.

320
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,639
We sang this evening about blessed Redeemer

321
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,679
and what a wonderful Redeemer he is.

322
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,199
We sang this morning, it's a song that asks a question,

323
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:31,599
are you washed in the blood,

324
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,800
the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?

325
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,839
I often will say in the chorus of that song,

326
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,239
when it says, are you washed

327
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,279
and you hold it out in the blood,

328
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,279
I'll say, yes, I am kind of as a repeat, if you will.

329
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,319
I don't know what the right musical term is,

330
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,599
but man, I'm thankful to be washed in the blood,

331
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,880
to know that I've been saved by the grace of God.

332
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,119
Notice what Paul says with regard to his position in Christ

333
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,440
beginning in verse number one of 2 Corinthians five.

334
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,839
Notice these words, for we know.

335
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:11,399
Now, we made note of Romans eight and 28

336
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,919
and we talked about the start and we know.

337
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,399
Here, Paul says, for we know.

338
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:20,319
Notice what it says, that we know,

339
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,639
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,

340
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,119
what does he mean by that?

341
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,399
When we die, to make it real plain and simple,

342
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:34,940
that this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved.

343
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,319
We have a building of God

344
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,319
and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

345
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,479
For in this, we groan earnestly,

346
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:49,520
desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

347
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,860
which is from heaven.

348
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,399
If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

349
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:59,399
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.

350
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Not for that we could be unclothed, but clothed upon.

351
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,319
Notice what he says, that mortality might be swallowed up

352
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,039
of, what does it say?

353
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,039
Life, not swallowed up of death, of life.

354
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,279
Because he's talking about being saved

355
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,480
and having confidence of being saved.

356
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Verse number five, now he that hath wrought us

357
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,399
for the self, same thing as God,

358
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,600
who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

359
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,279
If you look at Ephesians one, we don't have time to go there

360
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,839
but we find that the Holy Spirit of God

361
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,799
is given to the child of God at the moment of salvation

362
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,100
and he is the earnest of our inheritance.

363
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,980
We talk about being, that we have been indwelled

364
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,019
by the Holy Spirit of God.

365
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,820
But verse six says, therefore, notice this,

366
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,679
we are always, do you see the word confident?

367
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,059
Knowing that whilst we are at home in the body,

368
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,660
we are absent from the Lord.

369
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,380
For we walk by faith, not by sight.

370
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,399
What's he saying here?

371
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,820
Well, listen, as long as we're in this body,

372
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,139
we're absent from the Lord.

373
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,260
I'm not in heaven in his presence, I'm here.

374
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,440
Now we understand that God is everywhere.

375
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,700
We just talk about the omnipresence of God

376
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,739
but we see that he says we walk by faith, not by sight.

377
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:20,579
But then notice the contrast, he says,

378
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:22,260
that we're confident in verse number six,

379
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,559
that if we're here in this body, in this tabernacle

380
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,899
that we have, that we're absent from the Lord.

381
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,700
But then notice verse number eight.

382
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,799
We are confident, I say, and willing,

383
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,380
rather to be absent from the body

384
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,359
and to be present with the Lord.

385
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,419
Wherefore, we labor that whether present or absent,

386
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,019
we may be accepted of him.

387
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,700
So verse number eight is a verse that we often will quote

388
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,139
in 2 Corinthians chapter five, verse number eight,

389
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,700
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

390
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,859
But we know that Paul says that we are confident,

391
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,239
not only confident, but he says willing,

392
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,700
rather to be absent from the body

393
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,059
and to be present with the Lord.

394
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,959
We talk about the confidence of Joseph

395
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,100
as we see in Genesis chapter number 50.

396
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,139
I wonder this evening, two aspects of confidence

397
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:11,500
in the life of a believer.

398
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,579
Number one, are you confident that God is in control

399
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,459
of the affairs of your life?

400
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,200
Are you confident of that this evening?

401
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,980
That God rules, that God reigns, that God is in control,

402
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,600
that God has a plan, that God's way is perfect,

403
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
that God makes no mistakes.

404
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,019
You know who often messes it up?

405
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,739
The person you look at in the mirror.

406
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:38,299
We're the ones that mess it up, amen?

407
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,500
But I wonder tonight, are you confident of heaven?

408
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,419
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

409
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,579
This was confidence.

410
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,100
Paul starts the fifth chapter of 2 Corinthians,

411
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,779
for we know, a confidence.

412
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,820
Listen, so often I hear people,

413
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,459
as I talk to them about their soul and about heaven,

414
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,059
well, I hope so.

415
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,139
I hope I could make it.

416
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,419
I hope I could be good enough.

417
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:05,459
I hope I could, listen, we can know,

418
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,619
and I know most of you do.

419
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,940
I'm thankful this evening for the confidence that we have,

420
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,260
that we'll see Him face to face,

421
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,380
go through life every day with that measure of confidence.

422
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,700
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

423
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,500
I don't know when I'm gonna die.

424
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,700
You don't know when you're gonna die,

425
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,899
but we know that death could take place at any moment.

426
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,079
Right, we know that.

427
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,619
People die, I don't know, I can't remember

428
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,779
what the numbers are, it changes all the time,

429
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,500
but people around the globe, I mean, every second,

430
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,260
20 people die or something, it's a crazy number.

431
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,019
It's crazy how many people die every day.

432
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,139
We need to be confident of heaven.

433
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:49,940
If you don't have that confidence,

434
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,320
oh, we love that today would be the day of your salvation.

435
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,059
We note the concern back in Genesis 50,

436
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,859
the concern of Joseph's brethren.

437
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,579
We note the confidence of Joseph.

438
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,100
Notice finally with me this evening, number three,

439
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,459
note with me the compassion of Joseph.

440
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,779
I love verse 21.

441
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,779
I see the compassion of a man who'd been wronged.

442
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:21,299
Sometimes even as believers,

443
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,299
sometimes we have a hard time treating people nice

444
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,940
that treat us nice, yet alone,

445
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,820
somebody that doesn't treat us very nice, amen?

446
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,279
But Joseph had been wronged,

447
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,960
but he understood that God was in control,

448
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,880
that you meant it unto evil, but God meant it unto good.

449
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,919
God had a plan.

450
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,919
His plan was to bring to pass,

451
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,479
as it is this day, to save much people alive.

452
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,340
And God has me, had me exactly where I was supposed to be.

453
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,479
And we find that he responds to his brethren

454
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:03,080
in verse 21 with a great measure of compassion.

455
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
They say, behold, at verse 18, we be thy servants.

456
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,479
And Joseph says, fear ye not.

457
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:19,080
In verse 21, then notice what he says.

458
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I will nourish you and your little ones.

459
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,679
Wow, what compassion?

460
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,440
I mean, we read that previous in the account of Joseph

461
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,200
when dad was still alive back in Canaan

462
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,279
and Joseph was gonna send his brothers

463
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,440
to go bring his dad back and he says,

464
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
come back and I'm gonna take care of you

465
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,359
and I'm gonna nourish you.

466
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,539
But now dad is gone, dad has died.

467
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:47,059
The brothers think surely he's gonna requite us

468
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,880
for the evil that we did unto him

469
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,599
and we're gonna be his servants.

470
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,840
We'd be better to be a servant than to die

471
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,400
and this is a bad thing and dad is gone

472
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,840
and we don't know what's gonna happen.

473
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
And Joseph says, fear not.

474
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,800
I will nourish you and your little ones.

475
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Isn't that precious?

476
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:13,640
To think about the compassion that Joseph has towards his brothers.

477
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,480
It says in verse 21 that he comforted them.

478
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,600
I don't know, the Bible doesn't give all the specifics as to how he comforted them, but

479
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,320
it seems as if he comforted them through more than just words because the next statement

480
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,900
tells us that he spake kindly unto them and maybe as he did in chapter 45, he drew them

481
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,560
near to himself and he comforted them, perhaps he embraced them and he hugged on them, if

482
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,960
you will, and we find that he comforted them and then the Bible says that he spake kindly

483
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
unto them.

484
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,680
I made mention earlier, but we find that in Joseph's life that even his brothers, that

485
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,020
they hated him, according to Genesis 37 and verse number 4, that they could not speak

486
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,560
peaceably unto him.

487
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,040
And now Joseph, as he speaks these words to them of, fear ye not, I will nourish you and

488
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,260
your little ones, he comforted them and he spake kindly unto them.

489
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:21,160
What a beautiful picture of compassion and forgiveness, a man that understood who God

490
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:28,360
is and who he is, understood that God has a plan and God's plan is perfect and sometimes

491
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:36,440
as we've seen the life of Joseph, God allowed Joseph to see the plan, to understand what

492
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
God was doing.

493
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,840
You know, at times in your life and in my life, we may not fully understand what God

494
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,560
is doing, maybe years before we understand what God is doing.

495
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,320
It may not be on this side of eternity that we find out what God was doing and how God

496
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,600
was working and why God was working how he was.

497
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,440
But we must rest in the fact that we understand that God is sovereign and God is good.

498
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
God has a plan.

499
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,040
I noticed that phrase that he spake kindly unto them.

500
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,300
The New Testament were given some, actually throughout the scriptures, but the New Testament

501
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,440
couple of verses were given some instruction with regard to our words.

502
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,180
In Ephesians chapter 4, turn there quickly if you will, we'll look at two verses and

503
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,400
be done.

504
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Ephesians 4, it's a passage of scripture that deals with the put off and put on principle.

505
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:41,960
We find that God addresses our speech in verse 29, he, Joseph, spake kindly unto them.

506
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,080
In Ephesians 4 and verse 29, the Bible says, let no corrupt communication proceed out of

507
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:55,160
your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace

508
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,680
unto the hearers.

509
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,840
What a great verse of scripture that we can use our words to build up, to edify.

510
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:12,440
That we can use our words in such a way that it ministers grace unto the hearers.

511
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Have you ever heard someone speak kindly?

512
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,320
Speak graciously?

513
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
That's how we are to speak.

514
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:28,680
Colossians 4 and verse number 6 says, let your speech be always with grace, seasoned

515
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:36,560
with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

516
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Let your speech be always with grace.

517
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,760
That's a great piece of instruction that's given to us with regard to our speech, seasoned

518
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,760
with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

519
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,800
This evening we see the compassion of Joseph.

520
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,480
He tells them to fear not, he tells them that he will nourish not only them but their little

521
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,040
ones and he comforted them and then he spoke kindly unto them.

522
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,360
This evening, just as Joseph demonstrated grace and compassion, we too as the people

523
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:18,400
of God need to be a compassionate people, a people that show grace, kindness.

524
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:26,360
The Bible speaks of our Savior that he is a God who is moved with compassion.

525
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,000
As we note here in this text of scripture, we see Joseph's response.

526
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,200
The boys, the brothers, as they travel back from burying dad, they're concerned.

527
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,160
What's going to happen now that dad is gone?

528
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,320
I mean, surely Joseph is going to, I mean, he's going to requite us for the evil that

529
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
we did unto him.

530
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,120
I mean, this is a bad situation for us and they devise this plan.

531
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,600
They thought that something bad would happen to them and so they have these messengers

532
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,360
go and offer these words that Jacob spoke before he died with regard to forgiving and

533
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,000
they offer themselves as being Joseph's servants.

534
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,280
Joseph says, no, no, no.

535
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,680
He weeps before them.

536
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,000
He says, I know who God is and I know who I am and I know that God is a gracious God,

537
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,800
a sovereign God and I know that God has a plan and I am confident that God was at work.

538
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,720
Though ye meant it unto good, excuse me, unto evil, God meant it unto good.

539
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
God was at work.

540
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,680
Listen, God's at work in our lives.

541
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,360
We may not always see exactly how God is at work.

542
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,960
You may think tonight, man, I got a mess.

543
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,260
What do you mean God's at work?

544
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,440
Just go back and read the life of Joseph.

545
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,120
There were times in his life where, I mean, he didn't know what was going to happen on

546
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
the next day.

547
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,680
He didn't know that he was going to go from the prison to the palace.

548
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
He didn't know that.

549
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,440
He was just daily walking with God, trusting the Lord and he had confidence that God was

550
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
in control.

551
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,360
This evening, do you have confidence that God's in control of your life?

552
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,400
Have you placed your life in His hands?

553
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,000
Allow Him to have His will and His way.

554
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,660
Lord use me for your honor and for your glory.

555
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,040
Do in me what you see fit.

556
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
I trust you, Lord.

557
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,720
I have confidence that you're a good God and you do all things well.

558
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,960
We spoke of that confidence of heaven in 2 Corinthians 5.

559
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,480
Tonight, I don't want you to leave here without having confidence that heaven is your home.

560
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Not hoping, but knowing, knowing.

561
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,520
Spoke with a man at his door a few weeks ago and as I spoke to him at his door, he said,

562
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,080
well, yeah, I mean, I want to go to heaven.

563
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
I hope I go to heaven.

564
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,600
I mean, he kind of gave the impression that doesn't everybody want to go to heaven.

565
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
He said, I just don't know.

566
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm trying to figure all that out.

567
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm just hoping that I could get to heaven.

568
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,480
I said, well, you don't have to hope, you can know, you can have confidence that heaven

569
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,160
is your home.

570
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,920
Not because of anything that you do, but all because of what Jesus did.

571
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,200
Isn't that wonderful to have that kind of confidence?

572
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,080
Joseph demonstrates great confidence in this text of Scripture and then he's compassionate.

573
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:26,480
Oh, that God would help us as His people to be a compassionate people, to speak with grace,

574
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:35,440
to speak kind words, to edify, to build up, to encourage, to minister grace unto the hearers.

575
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
God would help us to be compassionate people.

576
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,280
What a great picture that we see in the life of Joseph of how we as believers should behave.

577
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,000
He didn't have anything like we have with regard to the whole canon of Scripture and

578
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,200
yet he lived a life that was exemplary.

579
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,960
We still today study it and see from this man's life how we ought to live our lives.

580
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Let's pray together.

581
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Father, we love you.

582
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,080
We thank you for loving us.

583
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,400
We thank you for the life of Joseph.

584
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:14,880
We thank you, God, for this portion of Scripture that reveals to us the concern that his brothers

585
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,800
had but then, Lord, we see the confidence and the compassion of Joseph and God, I pray

586
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,480
that you'd help us to live with the kind of confidence that Joseph had, Lord, help

587
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,080
us to know that you're in control.

588
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,840
We believe what you've told us in your word and I pray that you would help us to live

589
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,960
every day with that measure of confidence.

590
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,760
Help us to be compassionate people.

591
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,960
God, if there's someone here tonight that's not sure of heaven, I pray the Holy Spirit

592
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,640
of God would work and draw that individual to you, Lord, that they might be saved.

593
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,480
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can and we'll thank you for it.

594
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,800
Would you stand with me?

595
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,680
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

596
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,320
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.
