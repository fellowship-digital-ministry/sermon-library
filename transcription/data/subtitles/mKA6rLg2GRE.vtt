00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Evening, Genesis chapter 50, and tonight we'll be looking at verses 15 through 21.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.199
Genesis 50, 15 through 21.

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:13.760
In the midst of our text this evening, Joseph makes a statement that is quite familiar to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760
many of us.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.920
In fact, part of Genesis chapter number 50 is often quoted by God's people.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.959
The part that's often quoted is,

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:27.479
Ye thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:31.840
That's not the whole verse, but that's the part that often is quoted.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.319
I've used that part of the verse or part of that statement, God meant it unto good, as

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.279
our title for our message this evening.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:46.799
As you recall from our message last Sunday evening, Jacob's final request, we understood

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.319
that the request was given, the request was granted after Jacob died at the end of chapter

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.400
49.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.180
We find that the process of mourning was fulfilled, and then Joseph and his brothers,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.319
they took a journey in order to bury their father, Jacob, in the place specifically that

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.800
he had given to them that he desired to be buried.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.360
The Bible told us in verse 14, as we finished up the text last Sunday night, that Joseph

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.760
returned into Egypt.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.040
He and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father, and after he had buried

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:28.400
his father, so they now returned to Egypt, Jacob, as we mentioned, was buried according

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.400
to his desire, and I think that the trip back to Egypt brought some mixed emotions to Joseph's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
brothers.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.760
As we begin our text of Scripture this evening, beginning in verse number 15, we see that

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.639
God gives us immediately some insight with regard to the conversation that takes place

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.680
amongst Joseph's brothers.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.519
Notice in verse 15, the Bible says, "...and when Joseph's brethren saw that their father

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:03.680
was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.279
the evil which we did unto him.

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:15.520
They sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying..."

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.559
This is all fabricated, you understand that.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.119
This is not actually what Jacob had commanded.

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:25.839
It says, "...so shall you say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.000
thy brethren and their sin.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.279
For they did unto the evil, and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.199
of the God of thy father.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:42.160
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him, and his brethren also went and fell down before

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.960
his face, and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.520
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not, for am I in the place of God.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.639
But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.479
as it is this day, to save much people alive.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:06.080
Now therefore, fear ye not, I will nourish you and your little ones.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.639
And he comforted them and spake kindly unto them."

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.839
If you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice, first of all, the concern of

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.940
Joseph's brethren.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.800
The concern of Joseph's brethren.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.580
For many years, Joseph's brothers lived knowing what they had, how they had sinned against

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.779
their brother, the evil that they committed against Joseph.

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.179
They lived for many years trying to suppress all of that.

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.940
And we understand that as they went into Egypt, they did not recognize Joseph.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.300
But on that first entrance into the country of Egypt to find sustenance for their families,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.139
we find that Joseph recognized his brethren.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.539
We find that it was a series of events that transpired with them needing to take another

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:55.500
journey into Egypt, and eventually Joseph would reveal himself to his brothers.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.300
And we've made note, as we've studied through the portion of Scripture, that when Joseph

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.100
had the opportunity to reveal himself in Genesis chapter 45, that his brothers, they were troubled

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.619
at his presence.

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.419
Why is it that they were troubled at his presence?

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.899
Well, they knew all that they did, and they understood that now Joseph standing in this

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.380
place of authority and power, they were fearful of what Joseph would do.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.660
And Joseph called them near to himself and he comforted them.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.540
And the Bible says in verse 5 of Genesis 45, now therefore be not grieved nor angry with

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.739
yourselves that ye sold me hither.

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:40.640
Then notice he said, for God did send me before you to preserve life.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.720
He said, for these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.079
in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:53.519
And again in verse 7, and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:57.239
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:04.559
Then notice verse number 8, so now it was not you that sent me hither, but God.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:10.679
When we studied through Genesis 45, we made note with regard to the perspective that Joseph

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:17.160
had, and certainly had a proper perspective on life and understanding all that had transpired.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.600
As we come to Genesis chapter number 50, obviously many years have passed, it's in Genesis 46

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.320
that Jacob and the family all go into Egypt, and we understand that the Bible tells us

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.200
that Jacob was there for 17 years in the land of Egypt.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.359
To the best of our knowledge, biblically speaking, what is revealed to us, there's

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:42.079
no time during those 17 years that anything with regard to past history is ever dealt

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.079
with.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:47.040
It doesn't seem, it's never brought up in the dialogue that we read in the account of

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.320
the book of Genesis.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.920
We find that there's 17 years there, all of those 17 years are not notated daily what

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.760
took place, but we do not have in Scripture of any record of these item, or these events

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.239
being discussed.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:08.239
We find now that Jacob dies, Jacob is buried, and the brothers are concerned.

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:12.880
As we note the concern of Joseph's brethren, we see in verse number 15 what they thought.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.380
Notice with me again, the Bible says that they recognized that their father was dead,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.959
so here's what they think, here's the conclusion that they reach.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:29.839
In verse number 15 they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:35.799
us all the evil which we did unto him.

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:41.339
They almost have this perspective, if you will, that Joseph has dealt kindly with us

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:48.000
over these past 17 years that we've lived in Egypt solely because of the fact that Jacob

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.320
was alive.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.279
And because of dad's presence, because of dad being here, Joseph really didn't say anything,

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.119
he didn't do anything with regard to the evil that we did unto him.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:05.200
So they begin to think as they're journeying back to Egypt, imagine with me on that journey

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.799
back to Egypt, and knowing that you've just buried your father, and they have this belief

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:18.920
that now Joseph is going to requite them all of the evil which they did unto him.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.980
They're concerned.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.140
We find that they devise a plan.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.339
We notice what they thought, but then we see what they did.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.859
They send a messenger with a message.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:34.500
It seems as if, as you look at the text in verses 17 and 18, that they're there in the

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.779
presence of Joseph as this message is being delivered to Joseph.

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:46.100
And basically as Joseph is receiving this message, it reveals again to us the measure

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.500
of concern that these brothers have with regard to what would happen to them, revenge

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.980
if you will, because dad is gone.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.420
And they acknowledge the evil that they did to Joseph.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.019
So here's the message that they give the messenger to deliver in verse 17.

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:10.540
Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren and their sin.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.820
For they did unto thee evil.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:22.220
And now we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.859
We find that they were seeking forgiveness.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:28.779
They were seeking that they would not have retribution, that there'd be no revenge, that

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:34.140
there'd be no penalty if you would for that which they committed against Joseph.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.140
And it's interesting because all the way back in Genesis 45, we mention the beautiful picture

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.119
of forgiveness.

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:48.080
We noted as we've looked at the names even of Joseph's children and how he mentions about

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.960
the way that God made him forget and God had blessed him, and understanding the fact that

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.479
Joseph was aware of God's plan.

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:02.320
Joseph was not allowing bitterness to have any place in his heart.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.520
He was not angry with his brothers.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.359
In fact, he forgave them and he had this restored relationship with them, but their concern

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:17.119
was that it was just kind of because dad was still there.

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:20.479
Now that dad's gone, how's Joseph really going to treat us?

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:26.400
But I want you to see that it was true forgiveness that Joseph had forgiven his brothers long

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.599
before this event in Genesis chapter 50.

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:35.940
In fact, the Bible says that Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.900
Joseph had already forgiven his brothers.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.239
We mentioned about the beautiful picture of forgiveness.

00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:46.859
We mentioned in previous messages with regard to the danger of bitterness, and in fact,

00:09:46.859 --> 00:09:50.500
there are many people today that deal with bitterness and they have bitterness in their

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.500
heart.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.500
And the reality is that Joseph was a man that he had learned to forgive.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.859
His brothers, they were concerned.

00:09:58.859 --> 00:09:59.979
The Bible tells us that.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:06.139
brothers after the messengers deliver the message and Joseph weeps that his brethren

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:14.379
they went and fell down before his face and notice what they say, we be thy servants.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:17.339
We be thy servants.

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:22.139
They were concerned it would be far better for them to live and be the servants of Joseph

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:27.259
than to die for the evil which they had committed so many years prior.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:33.499
So we note the concern of Joseph's brethren but I want you to note number two, the confidence

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.819
of Joseph.

00:10:34.819 --> 00:10:39.939
In verses 19 and 20 we see a man who has great confidence.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:40.939
Confidence in himself?

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:43.179
No, confidence in his God.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.779
By the way, we ought to be confident knowing that our God is in control.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:53.299
We ought to be confident knowing what God's plan is and that God has a plan that is greater

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:58.459
than any of us individually and that God will bring to pass that which he desires to

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:04.979
bring to pass and the process by which he chooses to bring those things to pass is completely

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:07.899
up to him and within his control.

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:14.339
We find that Joseph says this in verse number 19, he said unto them, fear not for am I in

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.339
the place of God.

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:20.619
I begin to think about the confidence of Joseph and I notice in verse number 19 that Joseph

00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:25.219
knew who he was and he knew who God was.

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:27.019
I'm thankful to know who God is.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:31.579
Aren't you thankful to know that God is on his throne, that God is sovereign, that God

00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:33.259
is a good God?

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.459
We ought to know what our place is.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:40.619
Joseph is not in the place, he is not God, he understands that God is far greater than

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:41.619
he is.

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:46.459
We think about what Isaiah says as God is making it clear, your ways are not my ways

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.299
and your thoughts are not my thoughts.

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:51.819
God transcends us.

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:57.859
We find here this evening that as we look at verse 19 that Joseph is understanding not

00:11:57.859 --> 00:12:00.619
only who he is but he understands who God is.

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:04.859
I wonder this evening, do we have a proper view of who God is?

00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:06.499
Do we see God in his rightful place?

00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:08.979
Do we see God high, holy and lifted up?

00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:12.179
Do we really believe that God is in control?

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:15.659
Do we really believe that God makes no mistakes?

00:12:15.699 --> 00:12:21.099
Do we really believe that God's ways are perfect?

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:25.379
Because all of those things that I just mentioned are biblical truths that we find within his

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.379
word.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:33.019
But the reality is that at some point in your life and in my life, the Bible truths need

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:36.819
to be lived out in our daily lives.

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:40.819
It cannot be that we only say that God is good when things are going according to the

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:42.379
way that we want them to be.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:46.659
It cannot be that we can say that God's way is perfect so long as it aligns with what

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:47.979
my way is.

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:50.939
No, God's way is perfect.

00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:52.619
God truly makes no mistakes.

00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:54.619
Do you believe that this evening?

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:56.979
I believe that.

00:12:56.979 --> 00:13:02.059
And we find that Joseph had to understand this, this perspective, but he had great confidence.

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:07.539
And I wonder this evening how we do, how do we fare in the trials and the difficulties

00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:10.259
in life and all that we deal with?

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:16.819
What is our confidence level with regard to understanding who God is?

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:19.179
Understanding that God has a plan.

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:25.059
See, my life is in God's hands and your life is in God's hands.

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:29.779
There are a lot of times in our lives that we might think that we're in control, that

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:37.499
we may think that we can go through life and we have the ability to manage various levels

00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:46.619
of processes, but the reality is that our God alone is in control of all things.

00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:51.739
Joseph continues to demonstrate his confidence in the Lord in verse number 20.

00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:57.619
He says, but as for you, he looks at his brothers.

00:13:57.619 --> 00:14:02.979
He says to them, ye thought evil against me.

00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:05.499
Is that a true statement?

00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:07.099
Absolutely.

00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:09.219
They hated Joseph.

00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:13.859
They could not speak peaceably unto Joseph.

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:25.099
They conspired to kill him and then chose to sell him into slavery instead of killing

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.819
him.

00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:32.459
And Joseph says, ye thought evil against me.

00:14:33.419 --> 00:14:38.779
And it could be in your life and in my life that we've had circumstances and situations

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:44.499
where people have thought evil against us.

00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:53.659
They have planned and desired to cause great heartache and pain in your life.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:15:02.179
But notice that Joseph does not end by simply exposing the evil intent of his brothers.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:10.179
He continues and says, but God meant it unto good.

00:15:10.179 --> 00:15:13.779
Can I tell you this evening, this is not a cliche.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:21.419
This is a man who has great confidence in knowing intimately his God, in knowing the

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:27.739
ways that his God works and understanding the fact that our God is a sovereign God,

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:33.179
that He is in control of the affairs of mankind.

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:39.059
And we find that as we come to a text of Scripture like this, that the Bible says, but God meant

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:41.619
it unto good.

00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:50.499
And He continues to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive.

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:55.979
If you think about the statement that is made in Genesis chapter 50 and verse number 20,

00:15:55.979 --> 00:16:00.219
and you understand all that we have studied throughout these many weeks of looking at

00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:04.979
the life of Joseph, we understand that all of those things that transpired were coming

00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:11.659
to that very point where God would allow Joseph to have an audience before Pharaoh to interpret

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:17.899
a dream that could otherwise not be interpreted by any magician or any other wise man within

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:18.899
Egypt.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:23.979
And Joseph not only was able by the grace of God and the ability of God to be able to

00:16:23.979 --> 00:16:33.379
interpret the dream, but then give to Pharaoh a plan that would result in much people being

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:35.579
saved alive.

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:42.099
Otherwise, the great famine that would follow, the great years of plenty, would have had

00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:50.539
a devastating impact on the population, not only in Egypt, but most especially in Canaan.

00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:57.579
And so Joseph, when we know the confidence that he has in this text of Scripture, it

00:16:57.579 --> 00:16:59.379
causes us to rejoice.

00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:00.379
Why?

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:03.819
Because we can have confidence in who our God is.

00:17:03.819 --> 00:17:10.019
We can be confident in knowing the plan that God has for your life and for my life.

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:14.699
Listen, Joseph did not have the Bible like we have the Bible.

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:20.499
You think about all that we have in this precious book and all that God has revealed to us,

00:17:20.499 --> 00:17:27.299
that would help us to have confidence in knowing the plan that God has for us.

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:30.219
I want to draw your attention to two New Testament passages of Scripture.

00:17:30.219 --> 00:17:35.019
First is in Romans chapter number 8.

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:41.259
Anytime you think of this passage here in Genesis chapter 50, often we would couple

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:46.499
it with the truth that we find in Romans chapter number 8.

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:52.059
It makes good sense to go from Genesis 50 to Romans chapter number 8 and to see the

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:55.979
connection between these two verses of Scripture.

00:17:55.979 --> 00:18:01.659
Joseph makes this great declaration revealing his confidence that he has in his God.

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:06.579
And we find that Paul writes, and he says this in Romans 8 and verse 28, and I like

00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:11.379
the first words, and we know.

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:23.339
I'm not sure how often I've heard Romans 8.28 quoted without quoting it completely.

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:28.979
So often I've heard Romans 8.28, all things work together for good.

00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:34.019
But the Bible says, and we know.

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:36.940
That's powerful.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.459
How is it that we know?

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:45.459
Well, because God has revealed to us in His word, His character, His nature, who He is,

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:46.779
the plan that He has.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:49.820
Does it mean that we're never going to have a difficult day?

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.019
No, it does not mean that whatsoever.

00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:56.940
But we find that as we come to Romans chapter 8 and verse 28, the Bible says, and we know

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:05.339
that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:09.940
according to His purpose.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.779
What a precious verse of Scripture.

00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:14.899
You say, well, this right here looks like a mess to me.

00:19:14.899 --> 00:19:17.699
I don't know how anything good is going to come out of it.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:18.979
You just keep trusting the Lord.

00:19:18.979 --> 00:19:22.059
You just keep doing what's right, and you let God be God.

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:27.260
And do you think Joseph, for two years, he's left in the prison, right?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.260
Forgotten.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.820
But God's timing was perfect.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:38.099
God's plan was coming just as He had designed it to come.

00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:41.099
We find that the Bible tells us that we know.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:49.299
Do you have the confidence today, tonight, as you face the uncertain times that you face

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:55.899
in your life, that we face in our lives collectively, corporately, as a people, as a nation?

00:19:55.899 --> 00:20:00.059
So often you will hear people make statements about various things.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:04.679
And so long as the things are positive or to their liking,

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:07.399
they'll make statement with regard to God being in control

00:20:07.399 --> 00:20:10.559
and God put that person there or God did this.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:13.239
But when it doesn't fit what they want it to be

00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:15.119
or what they think should be,

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:17.739
all of a sudden it's not God who put them there.

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.199
God is sovereign.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:23.339
God is in control.

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:27.799
I can't tell you how many times, and I hate to bring it up,

00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:32.119
I don't like dealing with so many political type of things

00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:34.519
and you know that, but I can't tell you how many times

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:36.839
I heard we're getting ready to have another election cycle,

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:39.799
get ready for all of the rhetoric again.

00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:41.399
But our hope is not in the White House.

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:42.319
You understand that?

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:45.439
Our hope is in Jesus.

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:46.279
Amen?

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:51.399
But so many people talking about stealing an election,

00:20:51.399 --> 00:20:53.239
this, that, changing, so on and so forth.

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:55.839
Listen, God rules in the affairs of mankind.

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.839
And even if all of that stuff happened,

00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:00.359
God allowed it to happen.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.720
God allowed it to happen.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.119
We either believe God's in control or we don't.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.279
We either believe God's in control or we don't.

00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:13.599
Plain and simple.

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:15.879
You can't have it that God's in control

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:18.559
so long as everything goes the way that you want it to go

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:20.879
and then all of a sudden God must not be in control

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:23.459
when it doesn't go the way that you want it to go.

00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:24.559
Amen?

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.519
God's in control.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:29.439
By the way, I'm thankful that God's in control

00:21:29.439 --> 00:21:32.239
because God, he knows all things.

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:35.239
He is the only one that should be in control.

00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:38.360
And we ought to readily allow him to have control.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.680
Joseph had great confidence.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.839
Let me take you to another New Testament verse of Scripture.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:44.839
In 2 Corinthians chapter five,

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:47.360
we speak about having confidence

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.239
with regard to the affairs of life

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:52.439
and to the events that would transpire in your life

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:54.799
and in my life as we see it in Joseph's life

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:57.599
here in Genesis 50, as he's looking back

00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:00.559
at those evil things that his brothers did to him.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.279
But he says, God meant it unto good.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.239
God had a plan.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.239
God had a purpose.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.880
God is sovereign and my life is in the hands of my God.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.319
But I want you to notice when we think about

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:11.679
this subject of confidence,

00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:13.520
I want you to see what Paul says

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.160
in 2 Corinthians chapter five with regard to confidence.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.279
We sang this evening about the truth of Calvary.

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:22.639
We sang this evening about blessed Redeemer

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:24.679
and what a wonderful Redeemer he is.

00:22:24.679 --> 00:22:28.199
We sang this morning, it's a song that asks a question,

00:22:28.199 --> 00:22:31.599
are you washed in the blood,

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:34.800
the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:38.839
I often will say in the chorus of that song,

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:40.239
when it says, are you washed

00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:42.279
and you hold it out in the blood,

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:47.279
I'll say, yes, I am kind of as a repeat, if you will.

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:49.319
I don't know what the right musical term is,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.599
but man, I'm thankful to be washed in the blood,

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:54.880
to know that I've been saved by the grace of God.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.119
Notice what Paul says with regard to his position in Christ

00:22:58.119 --> 00:23:02.440
beginning in verse number one of 2 Corinthians five.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.839
Notice these words, for we know.

00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:11.399
Now, we made note of Romans eight and 28

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:15.919
and we talked about the start and we know.

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.399
Here, Paul says, for we know.

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:20.319
Notice what it says, that we know,

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:24.639
that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,

00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:26.119
what does he mean by that?

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:30.399
When we die, to make it real plain and simple,

00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:34.940
that this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.319
We have a building of God

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:44.319
and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.479
For in this, we groan earnestly,

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:49.520
desiring to be clothed upon with our house,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.860
which is from heaven.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.399
If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:59.399
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.720
Not for that we could be unclothed, but clothed upon.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.319
Notice what he says, that mortality might be swallowed up

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:10.039
of, what does it say?

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:15.039
Life, not swallowed up of death, of life.

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.279
Because he's talking about being saved

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:19.480
and having confidence of being saved.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.480
Verse number five, now he that hath wrought us

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.399
for the self, same thing as God,

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:29.600
who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.279
If you look at Ephesians one, we don't have time to go there

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.839
but we find that the Holy Spirit of God

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:36.799
is given to the child of God at the moment of salvation

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:40.100
and he is the earnest of our inheritance.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.980
We talk about being, that we have been indwelled

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.019
by the Holy Spirit of God.

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:49.820
But verse six says, therefore, notice this,

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.679
we are always, do you see the word confident?

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:58.059
Knowing that whilst we are at home in the body,

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:00.660
we are absent from the Lord.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.380
For we walk by faith, not by sight.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.399
What's he saying here?

00:25:03.399 --> 00:25:05.820
Well, listen, as long as we're in this body,

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.139
we're absent from the Lord.

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:10.260
I'm not in heaven in his presence, I'm here.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.440
Now we understand that God is everywhere.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.700
We just talk about the omnipresence of God

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:17.739
but we see that he says we walk by faith, not by sight.

00:25:17.739 --> 00:25:20.579
But then notice the contrast, he says,

00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:22.260
that we're confident in verse number six,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.559
that if we're here in this body, in this tabernacle

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:26.899
that we have, that we're absent from the Lord.

00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:28.700
But then notice verse number eight.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.799
We are confident, I say, and willing,

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:37.380
rather to be absent from the body

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.359
and to be present with the Lord.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.419
Wherefore, we labor that whether present or absent,

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:46.019
we may be accepted of him.

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:48.700
So verse number eight is a verse that we often will quote

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.139
in 2 Corinthians chapter five, verse number eight,

00:25:51.139 --> 00:25:53.700
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.859
But we know that Paul says that we are confident,

00:25:57.859 --> 00:26:00.239
not only confident, but he says willing,

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:01.700
rather to be absent from the body

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.059
and to be present with the Lord.

00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:04.959
We talk about the confidence of Joseph

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:07.100
as we see in Genesis chapter number 50.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.139
I wonder this evening, two aspects of confidence

00:26:10.139 --> 00:26:11.500
in the life of a believer.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.579
Number one, are you confident that God is in control

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:16.459
of the affairs of your life?

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:21.200
Are you confident of that this evening?

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.980
That God rules, that God reigns, that God is in control,

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.600
that God has a plan, that God's way is perfect,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600
that God makes no mistakes.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.019
You know who often messes it up?

00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:35.739
The person you look at in the mirror.

00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:38.299
We're the ones that mess it up, amen?

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.500
But I wonder tonight, are you confident of heaven?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.419
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:46.579
This was confidence.

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:49.100
Paul starts the fifth chapter of 2 Corinthians,

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.779
for we know, a confidence.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:55.820
Listen, so often I hear people,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.459
as I talk to them about their soul and about heaven,

00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:00.059
well, I hope so.

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:01.139
I hope I could make it.

00:27:01.139 --> 00:27:02.419
I hope I could be good enough.

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:05.459
I hope I could, listen, we can know,

00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:07.619
and I know most of you do.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.940
I'm thankful this evening for the confidence that we have,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.260
that we'll see Him face to face,

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.380
go through life every day with that measure of confidence.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.700
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.500
I don't know when I'm gonna die.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.700
You don't know when you're gonna die,

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.899
but we know that death could take place at any moment.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:29.079
Right, we know that.

00:27:30.179 --> 00:27:31.619
People die, I don't know, I can't remember

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:33.779
what the numbers are, it changes all the time,

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:36.500
but people around the globe, I mean, every second,

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.260
20 people die or something, it's a crazy number.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.019
It's crazy how many people die every day.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.139
We need to be confident of heaven.

00:27:48.139 --> 00:27:49.940
If you don't have that confidence,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.320
oh, we love that today would be the day of your salvation.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.059
We note the concern back in Genesis 50,

00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:57.859
the concern of Joseph's brethren.

00:27:57.859 --> 00:27:59.579
We note the confidence of Joseph.

00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:02.100
Notice finally with me this evening, number three,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.459
note with me the compassion of Joseph.

00:28:05.459 --> 00:28:07.779
I love verse 21.

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:12.779
I see the compassion of a man who'd been wronged.

00:28:18.139 --> 00:28:21.299
Sometimes even as believers,

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.299
sometimes we have a hard time treating people nice

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:25.940
that treat us nice, yet alone,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.820
somebody that doesn't treat us very nice, amen?

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:33.279
But Joseph had been wronged,

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:36.960
but he understood that God was in control,

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.880
that you meant it unto evil, but God meant it unto good.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.919
God had a plan.

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:44.919
His plan was to bring to pass,

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:47.479
as it is this day, to save much people alive.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.340
And God has me, had me exactly where I was supposed to be.

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:59.479
And we find that he responds to his brethren

00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:03.080
in verse 21 with a great measure of compassion.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
They say, behold, at verse 18, we be thy servants.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.479
And Joseph says, fear ye not.

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:19.080
In verse 21, then notice what he says.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.080
I will nourish you and your little ones.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.679
Wow, what compassion?

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:31.440
I mean, we read that previous in the account of Joseph

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.200
when dad was still alive back in Canaan

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.279
and Joseph was gonna send his brothers

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:38.440
to go bring his dad back and he says,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.200
come back and I'm gonna take care of you

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.359
and I'm gonna nourish you.

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:44.539
But now dad is gone, dad has died.

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:47.059
The brothers think surely he's gonna requite us

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.880
for the evil that we did unto him

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.599
and we're gonna be his servants.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.840
We'd be better to be a servant than to die

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.400
and this is a bad thing and dad is gone

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.840
and we don't know what's gonna happen.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.840
And Joseph says, fear not.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.800
I will nourish you and your little ones.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800
Isn't that precious?

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.640
To think about the compassion that Joseph has towards his brothers.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.480
It says in verse 21 that he comforted them.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:23.600
I don't know, the Bible doesn't give all the specifics as to how he comforted them, but

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.320
it seems as if he comforted them through more than just words because the next statement

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.900
tells us that he spake kindly unto them and maybe as he did in chapter 45, he drew them

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:41.560
near to himself and he comforted them, perhaps he embraced them and he hugged on them, if

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.960
you will, and we find that he comforted them and then the Bible says that he spake kindly

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.960
unto them.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.680
I made mention earlier, but we find that in Joseph's life that even his brothers, that

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.020
they hated him, according to Genesis 37 and verse number 4, that they could not speak

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.560
peaceably unto him.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.040
And now Joseph, as he speaks these words to them of, fear ye not, I will nourish you and

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.260
your little ones, he comforted them and he spake kindly unto them.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:21.160
What a beautiful picture of compassion and forgiveness, a man that understood who God

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:28.360
is and who he is, understood that God has a plan and God's plan is perfect and sometimes

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:36.440
as we've seen the life of Joseph, God allowed Joseph to see the plan, to understand what

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440
God was doing.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.840
You know, at times in your life and in my life, we may not fully understand what God

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.560
is doing, maybe years before we understand what God is doing.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.320
It may not be on this side of eternity that we find out what God was doing and how God

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.600
was working and why God was working how he was.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.440
But we must rest in the fact that we understand that God is sovereign and God is good.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.360
God has a plan.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.040
I noticed that phrase that he spake kindly unto them.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.300
The New Testament were given some, actually throughout the scriptures, but the New Testament

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.440
couple of verses were given some instruction with regard to our words.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.180
In Ephesians chapter 4, turn there quickly if you will, we'll look at two verses and

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.400
be done.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:28.920
Ephesians 4, it's a passage of scripture that deals with the put off and put on principle.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:41.960
We find that God addresses our speech in verse 29, he, Joseph, spake kindly unto them.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.080
In Ephesians 4 and verse 29, the Bible says, let no corrupt communication proceed out of

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:55.160
your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.680
unto the hearers.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:04.840
What a great verse of scripture that we can use our words to build up, to edify.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:12.440
That we can use our words in such a way that it ministers grace unto the hearers.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.880
Have you ever heard someone speak kindly?

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.320
Speak graciously?

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.760
That's how we are to speak.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:28.680
Colossians 4 and verse number 6 says, let your speech be always with grace, seasoned

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:36.560
with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.400
Let your speech be always with grace.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:47.760
That's a great piece of instruction that's given to us with regard to our speech, seasoned

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.760
with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.800
This evening we see the compassion of Joseph.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.480
He tells them to fear not, he tells them that he will nourish not only them but their little

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.040
ones and he comforted them and then he spoke kindly unto them.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.360
This evening, just as Joseph demonstrated grace and compassion, we too as the people

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:18.400
of God need to be a compassionate people, a people that show grace, kindness.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:26.360
The Bible speaks of our Savior that he is a God who is moved with compassion.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.000
As we note here in this text of scripture, we see Joseph's response.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.200
The boys, the brothers, as they travel back from burying dad, they're concerned.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.160
What's going to happen now that dad is gone?

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.320
I mean, surely Joseph is going to, I mean, he's going to requite us for the evil that

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320
we did unto him.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.120
I mean, this is a bad situation for us and they devise this plan.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.600
They thought that something bad would happen to them and so they have these messengers

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:59.360
go and offer these words that Jacob spoke before he died with regard to forgiving and

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.000
they offer themselves as being Joseph's servants.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.280
Joseph says, no, no, no.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.680
He weeps before them.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:15.000
He says, I know who God is and I know who I am and I know that God is a gracious God,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.800
a sovereign God and I know that God has a plan and I am confident that God was at work.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:27.720
Though ye meant it unto good, excuse me, unto evil, God meant it unto good.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720
God was at work.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.680
Listen, God's at work in our lives.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.360
We may not always see exactly how God is at work.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.960
You may think tonight, man, I got a mess.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.260
What do you mean God's at work?

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.440
Just go back and read the life of Joseph.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.120
There were times in his life where, I mean, he didn't know what was going to happen on

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120
the next day.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.680
He didn't know that he was going to go from the prison to the palace.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.680
He didn't know that.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:01.440
He was just daily walking with God, trusting the Lord and he had confidence that God was

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.440
in control.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:07.360
This evening, do you have confidence that God's in control of your life?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.400
Have you placed your life in His hands?

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.000
Allow Him to have His will and His way.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.660
Lord use me for your honor and for your glory.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.040
Do in me what you see fit.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040
I trust you, Lord.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.720
I have confidence that you're a good God and you do all things well.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.960
We spoke of that confidence of heaven in 2 Corinthians 5.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.480
Tonight, I don't want you to leave here without having confidence that heaven is your home.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.760
Not hoping, but knowing, knowing.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:45.520
Spoke with a man at his door a few weeks ago and as I spoke to him at his door, he said,

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.080
well, yeah, I mean, I want to go to heaven.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.080
I hope I go to heaven.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:55.600
I mean, he kind of gave the impression that doesn't everybody want to go to heaven.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600
He said, I just don't know.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.000
I'm trying to figure all that out.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
I'm just hoping that I could get to heaven.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.480
I said, well, you don't have to hope, you can know, you can have confidence that heaven

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.160
is your home.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.920
Not because of anything that you do, but all because of what Jesus did.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.200
Isn't that wonderful to have that kind of confidence?

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.080
Joseph demonstrates great confidence in this text of Scripture and then he's compassionate.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:26.480
Oh, that God would help us as His people to be a compassionate people, to speak with grace,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:35.440
to speak kind words, to edify, to build up, to encourage, to minister grace unto the hearers.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.440
God would help us to be compassionate people.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:46.280
What a great picture that we see in the life of Joseph of how we as believers should behave.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:51.000
He didn't have anything like we have with regard to the whole canon of Scripture and

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.200
yet he lived a life that was exemplary.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:00.960
We still today study it and see from this man's life how we ought to live our lives.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960
Let's pray together.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.960
Father, we love you.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.080
We thank you for loving us.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.400
We thank you for the life of Joseph.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:14.880
We thank you, God, for this portion of Scripture that reveals to us the concern that his brothers

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.800
had but then, Lord, we see the confidence and the compassion of Joseph and God, I pray

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.480
that you'd help us to live with the kind of confidence that Joseph had, Lord, help

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.080
us to know that you're in control.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.840
We believe what you've told us in your word and I pray that you would help us to live

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.960
every day with that measure of confidence.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.760
Help us to be compassionate people.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.960
God, if there's someone here tonight that's not sure of heaven, I pray the Holy Spirit

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:47.640
of God would work and draw that individual to you, Lord, that they might be saved.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.480
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can and we'll thank you for it.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.800
Would you stand with me?

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.680
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.320
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.
