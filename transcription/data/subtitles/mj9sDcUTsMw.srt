1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,039
our responsibility to share the gospel,

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:05,579
but also our approach or how we are going

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:07,920
to follow this process of fulfilling

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,720
what God has given us to do.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,380
Last week, specifically, we talked about

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,579
how we can purposefully engage people with the gospel.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,680
Matthew 4, 19, Jesus said,

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,079
follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,600
And this is part three.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,079
I mentioned last week that oftentimes,

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,239
and what we're gonna do this evening

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
is go through all the verses

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,759
and share the verses that we would use

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,040
when we're speaking to somebody about the gospel.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,419
I mentioned last week,

16
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,299
I made a reference to the Roman's road.

17
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,939
It's a popular term that many of us

18
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,799
might be familiar with someone using that term.

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,720
And the reality is that we believe

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,200
in the power of God's word, amen.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,680
We believe that God's word is powerful

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,080
and we believe that God's word is profitable

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,959
and we believe those truths

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,080
and therefore we must use the Bible.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,199
God's words are much more powerful than my words.

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,800
And so anytime I have an opportunity to speak with someone,

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,819
I like to be able to share some verses.

28
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,239
There are times in which you might be able to open a Bible

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,879
and be able to show them some verses

30
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,360
and read along with them,

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
but we really need to commit some verses to memory

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,919
that we would be able to share with them

33
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:25,839
and be able to use the sword of the spirit,

34
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,440
which is the word of God

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,879
and be able to share the truth with them.

36
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,919
And sometimes in the very beginning of the conversation,

37
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,760
I like to share John 14, six.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,879
It's a great verse of scripture that Jesus said,

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,180
I am the way, the truth and the life.

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,300
No man cometh under the father, but by me.

41
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,199
And oftentimes I will use that verse of scripture

42
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,519
as an introduction kind of a verse,

43
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,019
getting right into it

44
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,279
and being able to share with them Christ.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,000
And another verse of scripture that many people,

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
even in our spiritually, scripturally ignorant society,

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,879
John 3, 16 is a verse of scripture

48
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,919
that I have found over the years that people,

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,360
sometimes they know it, they're familiar with it,

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,440
they've heard it.

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,059
For God so loved the world

52
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,720
that he gave his only begotten son,

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,240
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,699
but have everlasting life.

55
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,360
And I wanna get those verses in.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,199
Why?

57
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,759
Because God can use his word.

58
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,479
So even if my interaction with the individual

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,399
ends at that moment,

60
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,199
there's no opportunity to be able to go any further,

61
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,679
they're not interested, whatever it might be,

62
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,639
I've at least had an opportunity to share

63
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,740
some of God's word with them and God can use that.

64
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,880
The Holy Spirit uses the word.

65
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,919
And so what a unique opportunity.

66
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,440
Now, let me say this, oftentimes what happens

67
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,839
before I get into the verses of scripture,

68
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:54,279
people have this idea that I need to be well-versed

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,119
and trained so that no matter what the individual's

70
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:02,600
religious background is, I will know what they believe

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,360
and be able to counter that with Bible argument.

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Can I tell you, that's just an approach

73
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,800
that doesn't work real well.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
And why doesn't it work real well?

75
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,479
Because what happens far too often

76
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,440
is you begin having an argument

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,759
instead of sharing the gospel.

78
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,520
I will say this, Ronnie and I were knocking doors yesterday

79
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,800
and I was on the opposite, the receiving end of that

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,279
where the individual that we were talking to

81
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,559
made assumption about what we believe

82
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,960
because we're Baptist and he categorized us

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,639
and made some statements that just were not true.

84
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,240
And I know how that made me feel by hearing that

85
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,360
and now we were able to have a very good conversation

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,440
and it was profitable to an extent,

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,440
but the reality is that there was some mischaracterization

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,360
on the part of that individual because of some assumption

89
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,520
or something that he had heard somewhere

90
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,479
with regard to what we as Baptist people believe.

91
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,839
And pretty much he categorized Baptist

92
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,399
in the same category as any Protestant.

93
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:13,020
And he said this, he didn't use these words,

94
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,019
but basically what he said is that Protestants,

95
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,820
they just believe they can interpret the Bible

96
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
however they want.

97
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,380
That's not what I believe is a problem.

98
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,859
And first of all, we're not Protestants,

99
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,420
so I had to correct that misunderstanding.

100
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,579
We were never part of the Catholic church

101
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,200
and therefore we cannot be part of the Reformation

102
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,940
and the Protestant movement.

103
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,420
But needless to say,

104
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,980
I wasn't trying to have that discussion.

105
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,059
The reality is that we don't believe

106
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,359
that we can just interpret a passage of scripture

107
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:47,119
however we want, isogete it and just come up with some,

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,959
but the reality is that he had some truth

109
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,000
that he had experienced in his life

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,519
of seeing that how is it that one denomination

111
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,279
can take a passage of scripture

112
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,760
and interpret it a certain way,

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,600
and another denomination take the same passage of scripture

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
and interpret it a different way.

115
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,519
And that's an experience that he's had,

116
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,079
and so therefore he just makes this conclusion.

117
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,040
It is far better, instead of us trying to go

118
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,799
into the situation and take it from the approach of,

119
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,019
oh, they say they're fill in the blank,

120
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,600
whatever the religion is or the denomination is,

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,320
and that means here's what I'm gonna begin to say,

122
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,119
it's far better that we ask them and get information.

123
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,320
Remember last week one of the things I said

124
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,440
was ask questions, make inquiry.

125
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,579
Because when you begin to ask them,

126
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,880
then you're not just being able to make assumption

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,920
based on what a denomination teaches.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,899
I have found this over the years.

129
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,739
Most people that you come in contact with

130
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,380
if you've done any amount of study,

131
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,299
you know more about what their denomination believes

132
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,140
than they do.

133
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
All right, unless, there are exceptions to the rule,

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
but rule of thumb, my experience,

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,940
years and years of knocking doors

136
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,440
and interacting with people,

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,920
I know more about what they supposedly believe than they do,

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,019
and the reality is that it's far more effective

139
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,720
to have them share with you what they believe.

140
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I try to deal with the subject of going to heaven.

141
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,559
That's what we're most concerned about.

142
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,640
If you were to die today,

143
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,799
are you 100% sure that heaven is your home?

144
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,940
And that's what I'm trying to get to, why?

145
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,920
Because death is something that all of us

146
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,239
are going to face.

147
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,760
And so the question is, are you 100% sure?

148
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,040
Now, I've had repeatedly people look at me and say,

149
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,339
well, I mean, not 100% sure,

150
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,480
but you know, I'm fairly confident.

151
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,320
You know, I think so, I hope so, that sort of thing.

152
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,839
And so even if they say I'm 100% confident,

153
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,679
here's my response, that's wonderful.

154
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,519
Can you tell me how you know that?

155
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,519
And then guess what I'm getting?

156
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,239
I'm getting from them what they believe.

157
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:03,640
So now I understand from them personally,

158
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,160
not from whatever their religious background is

159
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,399
in making some level of assumption

160
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,619
that they must believe this,

161
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,200
because no, they're telling me what they believe,

162
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,279
and therefore I understand

163
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,000
where I should focus my attention on.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Most times, almost every religion of the world

165
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,600
teaches a work-based salvation.

166
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,720
All right, if you boil it down right there,

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,160
so there's two main issues.

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Number one, they don't accept that Jesus Christ is God.

169
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
All right, that's one issue, most of the cults.

170
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,799
All right, the second issue is they believe

171
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,739
that salvation is somehow attained through our good works.

172
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:45,420
And sometimes it's a mix of faith and works,

173
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,220
but there's works included.

174
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,459
And so when we understand as they share those truths

175
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,299
with us, remember the power of your personal testimony.

176
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,880
I talked about that two weeks ago,

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,100
about making it personal.

178
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,940
So what do I do?

179
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,179
Well, there are times when I have an opportunity

180
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,779
to share my testimony, and I'll say something like this.

181
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,579
Now, I was never part of any kind of denomination.

182
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,119
We just didn't go to church as a child,

183
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,799
but here's what I kind of believed.

184
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,040
And I don't know, Brother Armando, where I got this,

185
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
where I picked it up from, but it's just kind of,

186
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,399
if you asked me prior to going to church

187
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,480
and hearing the gospel, if I were to go to heaven

188
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,600
when I die, I probably would have said, I hope so.

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,359
I think I had a pretty basic understanding

190
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,679
that there's heaven and hell,

191
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:31,720
and I didn't know a whole lot about anything more than that,

192
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,520
but I think I would have said, I hope so.

193
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,039
And if you asked me how I would have known,

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,900
I had in my mind this idea of really this big scale,

195
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,659
if you will, and it's good versus bad,

196
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,539
and if I've done more good than bad,

197
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,380
then I'm gonna make it.

198
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,500
That was kind of my idea, my thought.

199
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,340
And so I live life for a number of years thinking

200
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,260
that if I could be a good enough person

201
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,900
that somehow I could make my way to heaven.

202
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,340
Now, the problem with that is it's not biblical.

203
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,820
There's a lot of people that think that.

204
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,419
So as I'm sharing my testimony,

205
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,679
because I know my testimony,

206
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,979
I am able to, and I'm encouraging you

207
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,900
to know your testimony so that you can do the same thing,

208
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,260
is you can focus on certain aspects of your testimony

209
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,580
that will be able to, it's your testimony.

210
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,859
They can't argue with you

211
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,380
that what you're saying isn't true.

212
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,739
You're gonna say, listen, you know what?

213
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,179
There was a time in my life that, man,

214
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,760
I thought the same way.

215
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,140
I thought, man, if I could just be good enough,

216
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,020
if I could do enough good, man, I could make it to heaven.

217
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,340
But you know, I was reading the Bible.

218
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,419
Somebody shared Bible truth with me,

219
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,880
and I found out that the Bible says,

220
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,200
for by grace are you saved through faith.

221
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Do you see how I just went right into a verse of scripture,

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,599
Ephesians 2, eight and nine,

223
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,000
and it says specifically, not of works,

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,280
lest any man should boast.

225
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,320
And I realized when I read that scripture,

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,679
when somebody shared that verse of scripture with me,

227
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,280
that I could not get to heaven by my own works.

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,760
I could not be good enough to get to heaven,

229
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,119
that if I could be,

230
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,519
then I would have reason to boast.

231
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,559
Look, I made it and you didn't.

232
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,559
But the reality is that it's not works, merit, salvation.

233
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,659
For by grace are you saved through faith.

234
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,299
It is all Jesus.

235
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,139
Amen.

236
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,299
Paid in full.

237
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:22,299
I know many of you this evening will not remember this.

238
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:23,999
Many of you will though.

239
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,839
There was a time in our society

240
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,719
before credit cards were as prevalent as they are today,

241
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,599
that there was a thing called layaway.

242
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,439
And some of you remember layaway.

243
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,079
And layaway was real popular at Kmart.

244
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,159
And some of you don't even know what Kmart is.

245
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,079
And Kmart had these things called blue light specials.

246
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,159
How many of you remember those, right?

247
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,319
You'd be in Kmart and they'd have blue light special,

248
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,999
aisle number whatever, right?

249
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,419
And my mom's mom was a Kmart fanatic, man.

250
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,879
She loved that place and she was all about layaway.

251
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,839
And my understanding is how layaway works

252
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,399
is you put the items that you want,

253
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,719
you put it in there and you put a little bit

254
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,879
of down money on it and then they keep it.

255
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,999
And then you have to go back in

256
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,479
and you have to keep on paying on it

257
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,479
and so on and so forth.

258
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,399
And then eventually you get the product

259
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,879
if you pay for all of it.

260
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,839
Now they just let you take a credit card

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,119
and pay however many percent your credit card has.

262
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,239
And you take the product with you

263
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,599
and you pay for it for,

264
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,319
hopefully you pay it off right away.

265
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,179
But if you don't, there are people that are paying

266
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,439
for the same pizza they ate 13 years ago

267
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,439
and they're still paying for it

268
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:26,079
because they just keep on racking up the credit card.

269
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,159
Our nation is in trouble with that.

270
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,479
But the reality is that that's not how salvation works.

271
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:34,159
Jesus didn't just make a down payment.

272
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,039
He paid it all.

273
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,399
And there's nothing I can do,

274
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,599
there's nothing anyone can do to earn salvation.

275
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:45,439
We are unworthy but because of his grace.

276
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,399
And so we try to get to that point.

277
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,699
So if you are interested in being able to learn

278
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:53,959
about some world religions and various denominations,

279
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,959
it's certainly, there's no benefit to it,

280
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,499
but it can present itself in a dangerous situation

281
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,399
where we become armed with information

282
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,279
and think, oh, we can win this argument.

283
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,279
Again, I've said it multiple times the last two weeks,

284
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,159
we're not trying to win arguments.

285
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,699
It's not about winning an argument.

286
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,799
Someone said, I met somebody

287
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,519
and they said that they were Pentecostal

288
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,779
and I didn't know what to say to them.

289
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,319
Somebody told me that just about three weeks ago

290
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,720
after doing door hangers.

291
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,559
And you know what I said to them?

292
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,239
I said, all you had to say is, oh, that's great.

293
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,139
Are you sure that you're going to heaven when you die?

294
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,279
And they'd probably say yes.

295
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,399
And then you'd say, okay, how do you know that?

296
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,759
And then they would give you an answer

297
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,199
based upon what they believe.

298
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,599
Now, I have an understanding

299
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,759
of what they probably would say,

300
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,959
but I don't wanna make the assumption for them.

301
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,759
I want them to tell me.

302
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,239
Does that make sense?

303
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,799
And so we're trying to have this conversation.

304
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,639
And then as I get into the gospel,

305
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,759
I'm gonna share the verses with you.

306
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,119
I'm not gonna read all the verses.

307
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm gonna reference them so that you can jot them down.

308
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,919
If you need to be able to get a copy of these later,

309
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,759
please let me know.

310
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,279
I'll be happy to share them with you.

311
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,799
But the first thing when we're interacting with somebody

312
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,759
and we wanna be able to share the gospel with them

313
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,000
and lead them to Christ,

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,159
sometimes, here's what I say.

315
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,080
If they say, no, I don't know.

316
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,360
I say, listen, if I could take just a few minutes

317
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,799
and show you from the Bible, from God's word,

318
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,080
how you could know for sure that heaven is your home,

319
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,239
would you be willing to take a few minutes

320
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,679
and look at what God says in his word?

321
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,839
And then at that point,

322
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,039
I'm able to get into the verses of scripture.

323
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,220
And the first point that someone has to recognize,

324
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,479
number one, is they have to recognize that they're a sinner.

325
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:29,440
Listen, if we don't start with the acknowledgement of sin,

326
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,299
then there's no need for a savior.

327
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,759
Okay, so we have to acknowledge, we have to begin,

328
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,399
as it is written, Romans 3.10,

329
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,519
there's none righteous, no, not one.

330
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,319
Romans 3.23, for all have sinned

331
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,479
and come short of the glory of God.

332
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,080
So we begin there in the book of Romans,

333
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,559
Romans 3.10, Romans 3.23,

334
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,279
Romans 5.12 deals with the same thing

335
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,000
that while God demonstrated his love toward us

336
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,220
or commended his love toward us

337
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,519
and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

338
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,500
And so we deal with that truth

339
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,759
of the reality that we are sinners.

340
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,879
Now, it is important when you share

341
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,279
those verses of scripture,

342
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,399
the Bible says for all have sinned

343
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,860
and come short of the glory of God.

344
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,119
Does that mean you?

345
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,399
Ask that question.

346
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,839
Does that mean me?

347
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,940
I've said to a lot of people like, man, that means me.

348
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,600
When I wasn't the pastor, I said,

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,040
does that mean the pastor at the church?

350
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,479
Absolutely, it means the pastor of the church.

351
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,459
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

352
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,440
The only one that has not,

353
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
that ever lived a life that was sinless

354
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
is the Lord Jesus Christ because he's God in flesh.

355
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,760
All other humanity has been guilty of sin.

356
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,419
Here's my experience.

357
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,859
No person I've ever spoken to

358
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,239
had a hard time acknowledging that they were a sinner.

359
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:54,299
Now they might say, well, I'm not really that bad.

360
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm like, I didn't ask it what extent you're a sinner.

361
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,899
I just asked if you're a sinner, right?

362
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,279
Thou shalt not lie, all right?

363
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,820
Bear false witness.

364
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,019
The Bible says all men are liars, right?

365
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:07,019
Is that what it says?

366
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,820
And so the reality is that it is certain

367
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,459
that almost everyone you talk to you say,

368
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,859
have you ever told a lie?

369
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,959
You just deal right there, right?

370
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,500
And so most people will acknowledge that they're a sinner.

371
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,299
They don't have a hard time acknowledging that.

372
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,220
Number two, recognize you're a sinner, number one.

373
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,179
Number two, and before you go to number two,

374
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:27,179
you have to make sure they're tracking with you.

375
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,380
Make sure, hey, listen, you've already gotten their name.

376
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,779
David, do you believe that you are a sinner?

377
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,619
Yes, I believe that.

378
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:37,220
Okay, number two, they have to recognize

379
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,440
or realize that there is a penalty for sin.

380
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,559
There's a penalty, there's a consequence.

381
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,639
Most people, by the way, understand

382
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,639
and can relate to the fact that there are consequences

383
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,559
for breaking the law.

384
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,679
I oftentimes will talk about if someone goes out

385
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,440
on the highway and they are going excessively fast

386
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,760
and they pass a state police officer,

387
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
a county police officer, whoever it might be,

388
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,199
and they put the lights on and they get pulled over,

389
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,299
there's a consequence for their breaking of the law.

390
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,000
It's something that people can relate to

391
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,239
and they can understand.

392
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,720
So a sinner, all of humanity, has broken God's law.

393
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,799
And so therefore, we are guilty

394
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,239
and there is a penalty for sin.

395
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:25,040
Romans 6.23, for the wages of sin is death.

396
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,119
The wages of sin is death.

397
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,679
The rest of the verse, but the gift of God

398
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,839
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

399
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,479
I oftentimes, when I'm at this particular point,

400
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:37,720
I stop at for the wages of sin is death.

401
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,639
I'm not gonna deal with the entirety of the verse yet.

402
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,040
I'm just gonna deal with that first point.

403
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,880
Why?

404
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,279
Because I want them to recognize and to accept the truth

405
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,639
that the wages of sin is death.

406
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,839
What does that mean?

407
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,760
Hebrews 9.27 is an important verse of scripture.

408
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,639
It goes out of the book of Romans,

409
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,679
but Hebrews 9.27, as it is appointed unto man,

410
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,299
wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

411
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,839
All right, and here's what I do.

412
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,919
Oftentimes, and I don't use my full Bible,

413
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,199
I use the New Testament,

414
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,359
but I hold my New Testament like this

415
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,440
so that they can read the verse, all right?

416
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Now, I have these verses memorized,

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,239
and so I'm able to make sure if they read it wrong,

418
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm like, hold on a minute, it's 9.27.

419
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,199
Make sure you're looking at that verse

420
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,720
and be able to make sure that they're getting it,

421
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,600
and that way, they're reading it for themselves.

422
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,339
I don't like just quoting all the verses to them.

423
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,179
Why?

424
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:34,519
Because I want them to see that this is God's word.

425
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,519
I mean, I could just rattle off

426
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,040
whatever I wanna rattle off,

427
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,559
and they don't know.

428
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,679
Now, the Holy Spirit can still use it if it's God's word,

429
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,919
but I want them to see this is God's word,

430
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,679
and God's word is authoritative,

431
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,839
and we deal with the fact that there's a penalty for sin.

432
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,179
So what is that penalty?

433
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,440
That penalty is death, for the wage of sin is death.

434
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,279
What is death?

435
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,100
What does it mean?

436
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,559
Well, it's not just a physical death,

437
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,279
but most importantly, it's a spiritual death.

438
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,119
That's the wage of sin.

439
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,799
Separation from God for all of eternity,

440
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,720
and death and hell, Revelation 20, verses 14 and 15,

441
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,839
we're cast in a lake of fire.

442
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,019
This is the second death.

443
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,720
Most people, when you talk to them about death,

444
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,079
all they really can think of is physical death.

445
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,079
They don't really have an understanding of spiritual death

446
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,359
or separation from God for all of eternity,

447
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,040
and so it's important that we deal with that,

448
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,359
and so then I'll ask somebody,

449
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,139
okay, so I understand that you believe that you're a sinner

450
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,080
and that there is a penalty for sin.

451
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,880
You are guilty, and the wage of sin is death.

452
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,599
Yes, I believe that.

453
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm gonna make sure that they get it,

454
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,640
that they agree before I go to the next step,

455
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,239
and I often will say something like this.

456
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:47,739
Now listen, that's bad news, but the good news is coming.

457
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:48,919
You have to deal with the bad news

458
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,960
before you can deal with the good news,

459
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,479
because again, if you just start in Romans 10, 13,

460
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,839
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

461
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,539
shall be saved, it's a great verse of Scripture,

462
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,039
but why do I need to call?

463
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,159
If I don't know that I'm a sinner,

464
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,599
if I don't understand the penalty for sin,

465
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,679
what is the reason to call for a savior?

466
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,460
And so we deal with that truth, those first two thoughts

467
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,599
of the fact that you're a sinner

468
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,380
and that there is a penalty for sin.

469
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,359
Number three, realize, accept the truth

470
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,359
that Jesus died and rose again to pay for your sin,

471
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,239
to pay for your sin.

472
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,960
Romans 5, 8, but God commendeth his love toward us

473
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,839
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

474
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,119
And I'm so thankful, the truth of 2 Corinthians 5, 21,

475
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,279
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,

476
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,520
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

477
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,440
He took my place on the cross of Calvary.

478
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,599
He took your place on the cross of Calvary.

479
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,520
He paid a debt that he did not owe,

480
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,039
because I owed a debt that I could not pay, amen.

481
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,279
And I'm so thankful that he paid that debt.

482
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,119
How did he pay it?

483
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,960
Well, through his blood,

484
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,559
when he was hanging there upon the cross of Calvary.

485
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,159
his death, and then, of course, it's important

486
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,799
that we deal with the resurrection,

487
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,839
because that's proof that he is who he says he is

488
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,599
and that his sacrifice was acceptable,

489
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,559
and we look at the truth of the resurrection.

490
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,559
You could look at any of the gospel records.

491
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,559
I recommend Matthew 28, verses five and six,

492
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,399
because it's very concise, and you can just look

493
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,399
at those couple of verses, and so you deal with that,

494
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,439
and so you get to the point that, listen,

495
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,239
even though you're a sinner,

496
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,119
and even though there's a penalty,

497
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,759
a consequence for your sin, God loved you so much

498
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,559
that he took your place.

499
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,159
He paid for your debt.

500
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,699
He went to the cross of Calvary to pay for your sin

501
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:46,559
so that you could have eternal life,

502
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,779
and that's when you get to this thought,

503
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,559
really, this last thought,

504
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,599
is accept his free gift of salvation.

505
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,719
The Bible says in Romans 6, 23,

506
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:00,399
we read the first part in the second acknowledgement

507
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,439
of realizing that there's a penalty for sin,

508
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,159
for the wage of sin is death,

509
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,199
but the Bible continues that the gift of God

510
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,559
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

511
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,040
I oftentimes will give the opportunity

512
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,239
to make a comparison between what is a wage

513
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,040
and what is a gift.

514
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,619
I love the fact that those two words are used,

515
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,119
because a wage is not a gift, and a gift is not a wage.

516
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,759
They're not the same thing.

517
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,399
A wage is something that we earn.

518
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,759
Most people that you talk to, they know what a wage is.

519
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,919
They go to work, they get paid,

520
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,419
they understand what a wage is.

521
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,379
They also understand what a gift is.

522
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,799
And if I say to someone, and I've used the illustration,

523
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,360
if I, hey, listen, my vehicle's dirty,

524
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,639
I need you to wash it for me,

525
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,459
and if you wash my car, I'll give you 30 bucks.

526
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,639
Nowadays, it's gotta be like probably 70 bucks, right,

527
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,720
because it's inflation, just everything's more expensive.

528
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,799
And is that a gift or is that a wage?

529
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,239
Well, that's a wage, like I gotta wash your car

530
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,559
before you give it to me, right?

531
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,479
Yeah, it's a wage.

532
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,000
But if I just hand you something,

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,759
whether it's money or something else,

534
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,000
and say, there's nothing you need to do for this,

535
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,159
it's just, I just want you to have it, it's a gift.

536
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,160
Now, the reality is that someone had to pay for the gift.

537
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,020
Right?

538
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,520
If you get a gift for Christmas,

539
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,800
you get a gift for your anniversary,

540
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
you get a gift for your birthday,

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,619
someone had to pay for that gift.

542
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:27,580
In this context, understanding that the gift of God

543
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,739
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

544
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,139
he paid for the gift.

545
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,739
Now, something interesting about a gift

546
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,940
is that you have to accept it or receive it.

547
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,220
In our culture, it's not common

548
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,759
that gifts would be rejected,

549
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,279
but it certainly is a possibility.

550
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,699
Unfortunately, I've had people,

551
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,259
as I've gotten to this point even,

552
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,380
that have said, you know, I'm okay.

553
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,059
And it just makes my head spin.

554
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,539
Because I'm like, so you're rejecting the gift of God,

555
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,380
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

556
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,179
Now, I can't make them accept it,

557
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,059
and you can't make them accept it.

558
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:08,580
The Bible is very clear that salvation is a person,

559
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,839
an individual's decision that they have to make

560
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,179
to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

561
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,059
So, how do I get this gift?

562
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,059
How do I receive this gift?

563
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,039
If we look at Romans chapter number 10,

564
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,399
verse number 13, I mentioned it a couple of times

565
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,239
already this evening,

566
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,559
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

567
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,000
shall be saved.

568
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
What a wonderful verse of Scripture.

569
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,199
I've often said to people,

570
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,419
how do you call upon the name of the Lord?

571
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:36,259
Well, you pray.

572
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,099
You pray, and you acknowledge that you're a sinner.

573
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,440
You acknowledge that Christ is the only Savior,

574
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,479
that you're guilty as a sinner,

575
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,919
that there is that penalty,

576
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,679
that Christ is the only Savior,

577
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,119
and you accept that free gift of eternal life,

578
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,919
and you trust Him as your personal Savior.

579
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,199
I shy away from leading someone in a prayer.

580
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,239
I try to encourage people to pray themselves,

581
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,619
but there are times in which you may have

582
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:05,940
to lead somebody in a prayer.

583
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,199
They maybe don't know exactly what to say.

584
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:11,720
I always try to get them to pray out loud, all right?

585
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,020
Can you pray silently?

586
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,119
Absolutely, but I like them to pray out loud,

587
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,760
and Romans 10, verses nine and 10,

588
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,079
the Bible says that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth

589
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,639
the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart

590
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,799
that God hath raised Him from the dead,

591
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,399
thou shalt be saved.

592
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,600
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,

593
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,519
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

594
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,079
Now, with everything that I've shared this evening,

595
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,519
there's not one place that it says,

596
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,559
if you wanna go to heaven, go to church.

597
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:49,480
If you wanna go to heaven, get baptized.

598
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,079
If you wanna go to heaven, take the Lord's Supper.

599
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,160
If you wanna go to heaven, give to the church.

600
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,100
It's not there, it's not biblical.

601
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,160
There's only one way to heaven,

602
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,359
it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

603
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,940
Now, if I'm saved, I should be baptized.

604
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,119
If I'm saved, I should give to the local church.

605
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,859
If I'm saved, I should attend the local church.

606
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:13,559
We understand those things, but that's not how I get saved.

607
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,040
I get saved through the Lord Jesus Christ,

608
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,279
through His death, burial, and glorious resurrection,

609
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,399
accepting Him as my Savior.

610
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,919
So I know I went through those verses

611
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,279
somewhat quickly this evening,

612
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,839
but that's kind of an outline

613
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,079
of how you would step-by-step go through it.

614
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,320
If there's no opportunity,

615
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,679
if the individual's like, you know what,

616
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm not interested, I don't have time,

617
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,720
it's really busy, it's whatever,

618
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,959
get off my property, whatever they say.

619
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,480
If you have an opportunity

620
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,660
to at least share a verse of scripture,

621
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,799
it's the same, really, John 14, six is one

622
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,040
that I, it's just a go-to verse for me.

623
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm the way, the truth, and the life.

624
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,480
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

625
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,040
And I'll quote that sometimes in the very beginning.

626
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,679
If I don't have an opportunity, I quote it as well.

627
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,959
Hebrews 9, 27, as it's appointed unto man,

628
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,320
wants to die after this, the judgment.

629
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
And these are verses that we can be able to share with people

630
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
they might not even know that you're sharing

631
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,000
or quoting a Bible verse,

632
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,480
but the reality, as I mentioned last week,

633
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,440
is that we leave that conversation

634
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
and we can pray that God will use His word

635
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,320
to convict that individual.

636
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,919
The Holy Spirit, the Bible teaches us in John

637
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,000
that His ministry with regard to lost man

638
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
is to convict them, to convince them of three things,

639
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,079
of sin, of judgment, and of Christ's righteousness.

640
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,040
And so of sin, of Christ's righteousness,

641
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,399
and of judgment to come.

642
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,160
And so we understand that as we're able to share God's word,

643
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,000
as we're able to give the truth of God's word,

644
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,279
the Holy Spirit can use that.

645
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,079
All right, so I mentioned this last week.

646
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,959
Joseph, you can turn off live stream.

647
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,639
Goodbye to the live stream audience.

648
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,480
We're not gonna.
