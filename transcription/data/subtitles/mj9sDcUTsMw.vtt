WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.039
our responsibility to share the gospel,

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:05.579
but also our approach or how we are going

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.920
to follow this process of fulfilling

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.720
what God has given us to do.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.380
Last week, specifically, we talked about

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.579
how we can purposefully engage people with the gospel.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.680
Matthew 4, 19, Jesus said,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.079
follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.600
And this is part three.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.079
I mentioned last week that oftentimes,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.239
and what we're gonna do this evening

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
is go through all the verses

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.759
and share the verses that we would use

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.040
when we're speaking to somebody about the gospel.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.419
I mentioned last week,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.299
I made a reference to the Roman's road.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.939
It's a popular term that many of us

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.799
might be familiar with someone using that term.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.720
And the reality is that we believe

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200
in the power of God's word, amen.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.680
We believe that God's word is powerful

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.080
and we believe that God's word is profitable

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.959
and we believe those truths

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.080
and therefore we must use the Bible.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.199
God's words are much more powerful than my words.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.800
And so anytime I have an opportunity to speak with someone,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.819
I like to be able to share some verses.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.239
There are times in which you might be able to open a Bible

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:15.879
and be able to show them some verses

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.360
and read along with them,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.080
but we really need to commit some verses to memory

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.919
that we would be able to share with them

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:25.839
and be able to use the sword of the spirit,

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:27.440
which is the word of God

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.879
and be able to share the truth with them.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:33.919
And sometimes in the very beginning of the conversation,

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.760
I like to share John 14, six.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.879
It's a great verse of scripture that Jesus said,

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.180
I am the way, the truth and the life.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.300
No man cometh under the father, but by me.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.199
And oftentimes I will use that verse of scripture

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:51.519
as an introduction kind of a verse,

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.019
getting right into it

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.279
and being able to share with them Christ.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.000
And another verse of scripture that many people,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
even in our spiritually, scripturally ignorant society,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.879
John 3, 16 is a verse of scripture

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.919
that I have found over the years that people,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.360
sometimes they know it, they're familiar with it,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.440
they've heard it.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.059
For God so loved the world

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.720
that he gave his only begotten son,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.699
but have everlasting life.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.360
And I wanna get those verses in.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.199
Why?

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.759
Because God can use his word.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.479
So even if my interaction with the individual

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.399
ends at that moment,

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.199
there's no opportunity to be able to go any further,

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.679
they're not interested, whatever it might be,

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.639
I've at least had an opportunity to share

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.740
some of God's word with them and God can use that.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.880
The Holy Spirit uses the word.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.919
And so what a unique opportunity.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.440
Now, let me say this, oftentimes what happens

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.839
before I get into the verses of scripture,

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:54.279
people have this idea that I need to be well-versed

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.119
and trained so that no matter what the individual's

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:02.600
religious background is, I will know what they believe

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.360
and be able to counter that with Bible argument.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.960
Can I tell you, that's just an approach

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.800
that doesn't work real well.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.320
And why doesn't it work real well?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.479
Because what happens far too often

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.440
is you begin having an argument

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.759
instead of sharing the gospel.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.520
I will say this, Ronnie and I were knocking doors yesterday

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.800
and I was on the opposite, the receiving end of that

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.279
where the individual that we were talking to

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.559
made assumption about what we believe

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.960
because we're Baptist and he categorized us

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.639
and made some statements that just were not true.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.240
And I know how that made me feel by hearing that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.360
and now we were able to have a very good conversation

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.440
and it was profitable to an extent,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.440
but the reality is that there was some mischaracterization

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.360
on the part of that individual because of some assumption

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.520
or something that he had heard somewhere

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.479
with regard to what we as Baptist people believe.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.839
And pretty much he categorized Baptist

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.399
in the same category as any Protestant.

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.020
And he said this, he didn't use these words,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.019
but basically what he said is that Protestants,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.820
they just believe they can interpret the Bible

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.820
however they want.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.380
That's not what I believe is a problem.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.859
And first of all, we're not Protestants,

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.420
so I had to correct that misunderstanding.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.579
We were never part of the Catholic church

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.200
and therefore we cannot be part of the Reformation

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.940
and the Protestant movement.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.420
But needless to say,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.980
I wasn't trying to have that discussion.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.059
The reality is that we don't believe

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:43.359
that we can just interpret a passage of scripture

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:47.119
however we want, isogete it and just come up with some,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.959
but the reality is that he had some truth

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.000
that he had experienced in his life

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.519
of seeing that how is it that one denomination

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.279
can take a passage of scripture

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.760
and interpret it a certain way,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.600
and another denomination take the same passage of scripture

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.920
and interpret it a different way.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.519
And that's an experience that he's had,

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.079
and so therefore he just makes this conclusion.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:12.040
It is far better, instead of us trying to go

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.799
into the situation and take it from the approach of,

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:18.019
oh, they say they're fill in the blank,

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:20.600
whatever the religion is or the denomination is,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.320
and that means here's what I'm gonna begin to say,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.119
it's far better that we ask them and get information.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.320
Remember last week one of the things I said

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.440
was ask questions, make inquiry.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.579
Because when you begin to ask them,

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.880
then you're not just being able to make assumption

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.920
based on what a denomination teaches.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.899
I have found this over the years.

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.739
Most people that you come in contact with

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.380
if you've done any amount of study,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.299
you know more about what their denomination believes

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:53.140
than they do.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.200
All right, unless, there are exceptions to the rule,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.160
but rule of thumb, my experience,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.940
years and years of knocking doors

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.440
and interacting with people,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.920
I know more about what they supposedly believe than they do,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.019
and the reality is that it's far more effective

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.720
to have them share with you what they believe.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.720
I try to deal with the subject of going to heaven.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.559
That's what we're most concerned about.

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:21.640
If you were to die today,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.799
are you 100% sure that heaven is your home?

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.940
And that's what I'm trying to get to, why?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.920
Because death is something that all of us

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.239
are going to face.

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:33.760
And so the question is, are you 100% sure?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.040
Now, I've had repeatedly people look at me and say,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.339
well, I mean, not 100% sure,

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.480
but you know, I'm fairly confident.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.320
You know, I think so, I hope so, that sort of thing.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.839
And so even if they say I'm 100% confident,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.679
here's my response, that's wonderful.

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.519
Can you tell me how you know that?

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:56.519
And then guess what I'm getting?

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:59.239
I'm getting from them what they believe.

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:03.640
So now I understand from them personally,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.160
not from whatever their religious background is

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.399
in making some level of assumption

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.619
that they must believe this,

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:12.200
because no, they're telling me what they believe,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.279
and therefore I understand

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.000
where I should focus my attention on.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Most times, almost every religion of the world

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.600
teaches a work-based salvation.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.720
All right, if you boil it down right there,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.160
so there's two main issues.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.200
Number one, they don't accept that Jesus Christ is God.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.440
All right, that's one issue, most of the cults.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.799
All right, the second issue is they believe

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.739
that salvation is somehow attained through our good works.

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:45.420
And sometimes it's a mix of faith and works,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.220
but there's works included.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.459
And so when we understand as they share those truths

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:54.299
with us, remember the power of your personal testimony.

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:56.880
I talked about that two weeks ago,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.100
about making it personal.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.940
So what do I do?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.179
Well, there are times when I have an opportunity

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.779
to share my testimony, and I'll say something like this.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:07.579
Now, I was never part of any kind of denomination.

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:10.119
We just didn't go to church as a child,

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:11.799
but here's what I kind of believed.

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:14.040
And I don't know, Brother Armando, where I got this,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.040
where I picked it up from, but it's just kind of,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.399
if you asked me prior to going to church

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.480
and hearing the gospel, if I were to go to heaven

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.600
when I die, I probably would have said, I hope so.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.359
I think I had a pretty basic understanding

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:27.679
that there's heaven and hell,

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:31.720
and I didn't know a whole lot about anything more than that,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.520
but I think I would have said, I hope so.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.039
And if you asked me how I would have known,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.900
I had in my mind this idea of really this big scale,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.659
if you will, and it's good versus bad,

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.539
and if I've done more good than bad,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.380
then I'm gonna make it.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.500
That was kind of my idea, my thought.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.340
And so I live life for a number of years thinking

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.260
that if I could be a good enough person

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.900
that somehow I could make my way to heaven.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.340
Now, the problem with that is it's not biblical.

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:59.820
There's a lot of people that think that.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.419
So as I'm sharing my testimony,

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:04.679
because I know my testimony,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.979
I am able to, and I'm encouraging you

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.900
to know your testimony so that you can do the same thing,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.260
is you can focus on certain aspects of your testimony

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.580
that will be able to, it's your testimony.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.859
They can't argue with you

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:19.380
that what you're saying isn't true.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.739
You're gonna say, listen, you know what?

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.179
There was a time in my life that, man,

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:23.760
I thought the same way.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.140
I thought, man, if I could just be good enough,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.020
if I could do enough good, man, I could make it to heaven.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.340
But you know, I was reading the Bible.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.419
Somebody shared Bible truth with me,

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.880
and I found out that the Bible says,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.200
for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.400
Do you see how I just went right into a verse of scripture,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.599
Ephesians 2, eight and nine,

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:46.000
and it says specifically, not of works,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.280
lest any man should boast.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.320
And I realized when I read that scripture,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.679
when somebody shared that verse of scripture with me,

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:55.280
that I could not get to heaven by my own works.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.760
I could not be good enough to get to heaven,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.119
that if I could be,

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.519
then I would have reason to boast.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.559
Look, I made it and you didn't.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:09.559
But the reality is that it's not works, merit, salvation.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:12.659
For by grace are you saved through faith.

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:15.299
It is all Jesus.

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:16.139
Amen.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:17.299
Paid in full.

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:22.299
I know many of you this evening will not remember this.

00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:23.999
Many of you will though.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:26.839
There was a time in our society

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:29.719
before credit cards were as prevalent as they are today,

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.599
that there was a thing called layaway.

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:33.439
And some of you remember layaway.

00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:36.079
And layaway was real popular at Kmart.

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:38.159
And some of you don't even know what Kmart is.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:41.079
And Kmart had these things called blue light specials.

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:42.159
How many of you remember those, right?

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.319
You'd be in Kmart and they'd have blue light special,

00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:45.999
aisle number whatever, right?

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:49.419
And my mom's mom was a Kmart fanatic, man.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:52.879
She loved that place and she was all about layaway.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:55.839
And my understanding is how layaway works

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.399
is you put the items that you want,

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.719
you put it in there and you put a little bit

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:01.879
of down money on it and then they keep it.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:03.999
And then you have to go back in

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.479
and you have to keep on paying on it

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.479
and so on and so forth.

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:08.399
And then eventually you get the product

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.879
if you pay for all of it.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.839
Now they just let you take a credit card

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.119
and pay however many percent your credit card has.

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:15.239
And you take the product with you

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:16.599
and you pay for it for,

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.319
hopefully you pay it off right away.

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.179
But if you don't, there are people that are paying

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.439
for the same pizza they ate 13 years ago

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:23.439
and they're still paying for it

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:26.079
because they just keep on racking up the credit card.

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.159
Our nation is in trouble with that.

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:31.479
But the reality is that that's not how salvation works.

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.159
Jesus didn't just make a down payment.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.039
He paid it all.

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:37.399
And there's nothing I can do,

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:41.599
there's nothing anyone can do to earn salvation.

00:11:41.599 --> 00:11:45.439
We are unworthy but because of his grace.

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.399
And so we try to get to that point.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.699
So if you are interested in being able to learn

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:53.959
about some world religions and various denominations,

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:58.959
it's certainly, there's no benefit to it,

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.499
but it can present itself in a dangerous situation

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:04.399
where we become armed with information

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.279
and think, oh, we can win this argument.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.279
Again, I've said it multiple times the last two weeks,

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.159
we're not trying to win arguments.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:11.699
It's not about winning an argument.

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:12.799
Someone said, I met somebody

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.519
and they said that they were Pentecostal

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.779
and I didn't know what to say to them.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:18.319
Somebody told me that just about three weeks ago

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:19.720
after doing door hangers.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.559
And you know what I said to them?

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.239
I said, all you had to say is, oh, that's great.

00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:25.139
Are you sure that you're going to heaven when you die?

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:26.279
And they'd probably say yes.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:28.399
And then you'd say, okay, how do you know that?

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.759
And then they would give you an answer

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.199
based upon what they believe.

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:33.599
Now, I have an understanding

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:35.759
of what they probably would say,

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.959
but I don't wanna make the assumption for them.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.759
I want them to tell me.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.239
Does that make sense?

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:44.799
And so we're trying to have this conversation.

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.639
And then as I get into the gospel,

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.759
I'm gonna share the verses with you.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.119
I'm not gonna read all the verses.

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:51.720
I'm gonna reference them so that you can jot them down.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.919
If you need to be able to get a copy of these later,

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.759
please let me know.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.279
I'll be happy to share them with you.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.799
But the first thing when we're interacting with somebody

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.759
and we wanna be able to share the gospel with them

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:02.000
and lead them to Christ,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.159
sometimes, here's what I say.

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:04.080
If they say, no, I don't know.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.360
I say, listen, if I could take just a few minutes

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.799
and show you from the Bible, from God's word,

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:12.080
how you could know for sure that heaven is your home,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.239
would you be willing to take a few minutes

00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:15.679
and look at what God says in his word?

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:16.839
And then at that point,

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:19.039
I'm able to get into the verses of scripture.

00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:22.220
And the first point that someone has to recognize,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.479
number one, is they have to recognize that they're a sinner.

00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:29.440
Listen, if we don't start with the acknowledgement of sin,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.299
then there's no need for a savior.

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:34.759
Okay, so we have to acknowledge, we have to begin,

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:36.399
as it is written, Romans 3.10,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.519
there's none righteous, no, not one.

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:42.319
Romans 3.23, for all have sinned

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:44.479
and come short of the glory of God.

00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.080
So we begin there in the book of Romans,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.559
Romans 3.10, Romans 3.23,

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:51.279
Romans 5.12 deals with the same thing

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:56.000
that while God demonstrated his love toward us

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.220
or commended his love toward us

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.519
and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.500
And so we deal with that truth

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.759
of the reality that we are sinners.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:06.879
Now, it is important when you share

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.279
those verses of scripture,

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.399
the Bible says for all have sinned

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:11.860
and come short of the glory of God.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.119
Does that mean you?

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.399
Ask that question.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:16.839
Does that mean me?

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:19.940
I've said to a lot of people like, man, that means me.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.600
When I wasn't the pastor, I said,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.040
does that mean the pastor at the church?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.479
Absolutely, it means the pastor of the church.

00:14:26.479 --> 00:14:29.459
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:31.440
The only one that has not,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.760
that ever lived a life that was sinless

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.399
is the Lord Jesus Christ because he's God in flesh.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:40.760
All other humanity has been guilty of sin.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.419
Here's my experience.

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:47.859
No person I've ever spoken to

00:14:47.859 --> 00:14:51.239
had a hard time acknowledging that they were a sinner.

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:54.299
Now they might say, well, I'm not really that bad.

00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:56.940
I'm like, I didn't ask it what extent you're a sinner.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.899
I just asked if you're a sinner, right?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.279
Thou shalt not lie, all right?

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:03.820
Bear false witness.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.019
The Bible says all men are liars, right?

00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:07.019
Is that what it says?

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:09.820
And so the reality is that it is certain

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.459
that almost everyone you talk to you say,

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:12.859
have you ever told a lie?

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:15.959
You just deal right there, right?

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:19.500
And so most people will acknowledge that they're a sinner.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.299
They don't have a hard time acknowledging that.

00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:23.220
Number two, recognize you're a sinner, number one.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.179
Number two, and before you go to number two,

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:27.179
you have to make sure they're tracking with you.

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:29.380
Make sure, hey, listen, you've already gotten their name.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.779
David, do you believe that you are a sinner?

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:34.619
Yes, I believe that.

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:37.220
Okay, number two, they have to recognize

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.440
or realize that there is a penalty for sin.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.559
There's a penalty, there's a consequence.

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:45.639
Most people, by the way, understand

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.639
and can relate to the fact that there are consequences

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.559
for breaking the law.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.679
I oftentimes will talk about if someone goes out

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:57.440
on the highway and they are going excessively fast

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.760
and they pass a state police officer,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.760
a county police officer, whoever it might be,

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.199
and they put the lights on and they get pulled over,

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:07.299
there's a consequence for their breaking of the law.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.000
It's something that people can relate to

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.239
and they can understand.

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:14.720
So a sinner, all of humanity, has broken God's law.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.799
And so therefore, we are guilty

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:20.239
and there is a penalty for sin.

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:25.040
Romans 6.23, for the wages of sin is death.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.119
The wages of sin is death.

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:29.679
The rest of the verse, but the gift of God

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.839
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:34.479
I oftentimes, when I'm at this particular point,

00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:37.720
I stop at for the wages of sin is death.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.639
I'm not gonna deal with the entirety of the verse yet.

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:41.040
I'm just gonna deal with that first point.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.880
Why?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.279
Because I want them to recognize and to accept the truth

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.639
that the wages of sin is death.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.839
What does that mean?

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:51.760
Hebrews 9.27 is an important verse of scripture.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.639
It goes out of the book of Romans,

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:56.679
but Hebrews 9.27, as it is appointed unto man,

00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:00.299
wants to die, but after this, the judgment.

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:02.839
All right, and here's what I do.

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.919
Oftentimes, and I don't use my full Bible,

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:06.199
I use the New Testament,

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.359
but I hold my New Testament like this

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.440
so that they can read the verse, all right?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.160
Now, I have these verses memorized,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.239
and so I'm able to make sure if they read it wrong,

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:19.720
I'm like, hold on a minute, it's 9.27.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.199
Make sure you're looking at that verse

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.720
and be able to make sure that they're getting it,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.600
and that way, they're reading it for themselves.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.339
I don't like just quoting all the verses to them.

00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:31.179
Why?

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:34.519
Because I want them to see that this is God's word.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.519
I mean, I could just rattle off

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:38.040
whatever I wanna rattle off,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.559
and they don't know.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.679
Now, the Holy Spirit can still use it if it's God's word,

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:44.919
but I want them to see this is God's word,

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:46.679
and God's word is authoritative,

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:50.839
and we deal with the fact that there's a penalty for sin.

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:52.179
So what is that penalty?

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:55.440
That penalty is death, for the wage of sin is death.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.279
What is death?

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:57.100
What does it mean?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.559
Well, it's not just a physical death,

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:01.279
but most importantly, it's a spiritual death.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:03.119
That's the wage of sin.

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:05.799
Separation from God for all of eternity,

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:08.720
and death and hell, Revelation 20, verses 14 and 15,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.839
we're cast in a lake of fire.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.019
This is the second death.

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:14.720
Most people, when you talk to them about death,

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.079
all they really can think of is physical death.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:20.079
They don't really have an understanding of spiritual death

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:22.359
or separation from God for all of eternity,

00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:25.040
and so it's important that we deal with that,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.359
and so then I'll ask somebody,

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:31.139
okay, so I understand that you believe that you're a sinner

00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:33.080
and that there is a penalty for sin.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.880
You are guilty, and the wage of sin is death.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.599
Yes, I believe that.

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:40.260
I'm gonna make sure that they get it,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.640
that they agree before I go to the next step,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.239
and I often will say something like this.

00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:47.739
Now listen, that's bad news, but the good news is coming.

00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:48.919
You have to deal with the bad news

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.960
before you can deal with the good news,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.479
because again, if you just start in Romans 10, 13,

00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:54.839
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:56.539
shall be saved, it's a great verse of Scripture,

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:58.039
but why do I need to call?

00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:59.159
If I don't know that I'm a sinner,

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.599
if I don't understand the penalty for sin,

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:04.679
what is the reason to call for a savior?

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:07.460
And so we deal with that truth, those first two thoughts

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.599
of the fact that you're a sinner

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:10.380
and that there is a penalty for sin.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.359
Number three, realize, accept the truth

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:19.359
that Jesus died and rose again to pay for your sin,

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.239
to pay for your sin.

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:24.960
Romans 5, 8, but God commendeth his love toward us

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.839
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.119
And I'm so thankful, the truth of 2 Corinthians 5, 21,

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:36.279
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:40.520
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.440
He took my place on the cross of Calvary.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.599
He took your place on the cross of Calvary.

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:48.520
He paid a debt that he did not owe,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.039
because I owed a debt that I could not pay, amen.

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.279
And I'm so thankful that he paid that debt.

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.119
How did he pay it?

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:57.960
Well, through his blood,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.559
when he was hanging there upon the cross of Calvary.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:04.159
his death, and then, of course, it's important

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:05.799
that we deal with the resurrection,

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:09.839
because that's proof that he is who he says he is

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:12.599
and that his sacrifice was acceptable,

00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:14.559
and we look at the truth of the resurrection.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.559
You could look at any of the gospel records.

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:19.559
I recommend Matthew 28, verses five and six,

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:22.399
because it's very concise, and you can just look

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:25.399
at those couple of verses, and so you deal with that,

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:27.439
and so you get to the point that, listen,

00:20:27.439 --> 00:20:29.239
even though you're a sinner,

00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:31.119
and even though there's a penalty,

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:35.759
a consequence for your sin, God loved you so much

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:37.559
that he took your place.

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:39.159
He paid for your debt.

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:43.699
He went to the cross of Calvary to pay for your sin

00:20:43.699 --> 00:20:46.559
so that you could have eternal life,

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.779
and that's when you get to this thought,

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:50.559
really, this last thought,

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:53.599
is accept his free gift of salvation.

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:56.719
The Bible says in Romans 6, 23,

00:20:56.719 --> 00:21:00.399
we read the first part in the second acknowledgement

00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:02.439
of realizing that there's a penalty for sin,

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:04.159
for the wage of sin is death,

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.199
but the Bible continues that the gift of God

00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:08.559
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.040
I oftentimes will give the opportunity

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.239
to make a comparison between what is a wage

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.040
and what is a gift.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.619
I love the fact that those two words are used,

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:22.119
because a wage is not a gift, and a gift is not a wage.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.759
They're not the same thing.

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.399
A wage is something that we earn.

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:27.759
Most people that you talk to, they know what a wage is.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:29.919
They go to work, they get paid,

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:31.419
they understand what a wage is.

00:21:31.419 --> 00:21:33.379
They also understand what a gift is.

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:36.799
And if I say to someone, and I've used the illustration,

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:39.360
if I, hey, listen, my vehicle's dirty,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.639
I need you to wash it for me,

00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:43.459
and if you wash my car, I'll give you 30 bucks.

00:21:43.459 --> 00:21:45.639
Nowadays, it's gotta be like probably 70 bucks, right,

00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:48.720
because it's inflation, just everything's more expensive.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.799
And is that a gift or is that a wage?

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:54.239
Well, that's a wage, like I gotta wash your car

00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:55.559
before you give it to me, right?

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:57.479
Yeah, it's a wage.

00:21:57.479 --> 00:22:00.000
But if I just hand you something,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.759
whether it's money or something else,

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:04.000
and say, there's nothing you need to do for this,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.159
it's just, I just want you to have it, it's a gift.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:12.160
Now, the reality is that someone had to pay for the gift.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.020
Right?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.520
If you get a gift for Christmas,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.800
you get a gift for your anniversary,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.000
you get a gift for your birthday,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.619
someone had to pay for that gift.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:27.580
In this context, understanding that the gift of God

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.739
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.139
he paid for the gift.

00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:34.739
Now, something interesting about a gift

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:37.940
is that you have to accept it or receive it.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.220
In our culture, it's not common

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.759
that gifts would be rejected,

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:44.279
but it certainly is a possibility.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.699
Unfortunately, I've had people,

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:50.259
as I've gotten to this point even,

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:52.380
that have said, you know, I'm okay.

00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:55.059
And it just makes my head spin.

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:58.539
Because I'm like, so you're rejecting the gift of God,

00:22:58.539 --> 00:23:00.380
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.179
Now, I can't make them accept it,

00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:04.059
and you can't make them accept it.

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:08.580
The Bible is very clear that salvation is a person,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.839
an individual's decision that they have to make

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:15.179
to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:17.059
So, how do I get this gift?

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:19.059
How do I receive this gift?

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:22.039
If we look at Romans chapter number 10,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.399
verse number 13, I mentioned it a couple of times

00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:25.239
already this evening,

00:23:25.239 --> 00:23:27.559
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:30.000
shall be saved.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.080
What a wonderful verse of Scripture.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.199
I've often said to people,

00:23:33.199 --> 00:23:35.419
how do you call upon the name of the Lord?

00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:36.259
Well, you pray.

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:40.099
You pray, and you acknowledge that you're a sinner.

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:42.440
You acknowledge that Christ is the only Savior,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.479
that you're guilty as a sinner,

00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:45.919
that there is that penalty,

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:48.679
that Christ is the only Savior,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.119
and you accept that free gift of eternal life,

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:54.919
and you trust Him as your personal Savior.

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:59.199
I shy away from leading someone in a prayer.

00:23:59.199 --> 00:24:02.239
I try to encourage people to pray themselves,

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:04.619
but there are times in which you may have

00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:05.940
to lead somebody in a prayer.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.199
They maybe don't know exactly what to say.

00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:11.720
I always try to get them to pray out loud, all right?

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.020
Can you pray silently?

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.119
Absolutely, but I like them to pray out loud,

00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:18.760
and Romans 10, verses nine and 10,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.079
the Bible says that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth

00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:23.639
the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart

00:24:23.639 --> 00:24:25.799
that God hath raised Him from the dead,

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.399
thou shalt be saved.

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.600
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.519
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:37.079
Now, with everything that I've shared this evening,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.519
there's not one place that it says,

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:44.559
if you wanna go to heaven, go to church.

00:24:46.639 --> 00:24:49.480
If you wanna go to heaven, get baptized.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.079
If you wanna go to heaven, take the Lord's Supper.

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:55.160
If you wanna go to heaven, give to the church.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.100
It's not there, it's not biblical.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.160
There's only one way to heaven,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.359
it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:03.940
Now, if I'm saved, I should be baptized.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.119
If I'm saved, I should give to the local church.

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:09.859
If I'm saved, I should attend the local church.

00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:13.559
We understand those things, but that's not how I get saved.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.040
I get saved through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.279
through His death, burial, and glorious resurrection,

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:20.399
accepting Him as my Savior.

00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:21.919
So I know I went through those verses

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.279
somewhat quickly this evening,

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.839
but that's kind of an outline

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:27.079
of how you would step-by-step go through it.

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:29.320
If there's no opportunity,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.679
if the individual's like, you know what,

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:32.040
I'm not interested, I don't have time,

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.720
it's really busy, it's whatever,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.959
get off my property, whatever they say.

00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:37.480
If you have an opportunity

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.660
to at least share a verse of scripture,

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.799
it's the same, really, John 14, six is one

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:45.040
that I, it's just a go-to verse for me.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.200
I'm the way, the truth, and the life.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.480
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.040
And I'll quote that sometimes in the very beginning.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.679
If I don't have an opportunity, I quote it as well.

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:55.959
Hebrews 9, 27, as it's appointed unto man,

00:25:55.959 --> 00:25:58.320
wants to die after this, the judgment.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.600
And these are verses that we can be able to share with people

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.679
they might not even know that you're sharing

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:05.000
or quoting a Bible verse,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.480
but the reality, as I mentioned last week,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.440
is that we leave that conversation

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.320
and we can pray that God will use His word

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:14.320
to convict that individual.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.919
The Holy Spirit, the Bible teaches us in John

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:21.000
that His ministry with regard to lost man

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
is to convict them, to convince them of three things,

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.079
of sin, of judgment, and of Christ's righteousness.

00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:33.040
And so of sin, of Christ's righteousness,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.399
and of judgment to come.

00:26:34.399 --> 00:26:37.160
And so we understand that as we're able to share God's word,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.000
as we're able to give the truth of God's word,

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:42.279
the Holy Spirit can use that.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:44.079
All right, so I mentioned this last week.

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:45.959
Joseph, you can turn off live stream.

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:47.639
Goodbye to the live stream audience.

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.480
We're not gonna.
