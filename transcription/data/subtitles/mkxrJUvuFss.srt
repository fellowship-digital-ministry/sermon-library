1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
to be a blessing to you. Matthew chapter number one, in fact, will be in this passage of scripture

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,920
this morning. And then again, this afternoon, Matthew chapter number one, I'll begin reading

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,359
in verse 18 and I'll read down through verse number 25. And as you are turning there in

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,840
your Bibles, Matthew chapter number one, you will understand that as you study the word

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,600
of God, you will discover that one way that God reveals himself to mankind is through

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,479
his names. We find that in the Old Testament, we find a number of different names that are

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,680
ascribed to our God that would reveal to us certain attributes, certain characteristics

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,639
of our God. Why? Because one name is not sufficient to fully describe all that he is or all that

9
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:54,040
he does. And so we find that God has chosen one means by which he has revealed himself

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,200
to mankind is through his names. I'm thankful that God would be willing to reveal himself

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,480
to mankind, aren't you? And what a great joy and a great blessing that the God of the universe,

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,160
the God of heaven, loved us so much that he would not only come to this earth to die for

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,720
us, to be buried and to rise again, but we understand that he's given us a book, the

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,919
Bible, and he has revealed himself to us. We understand that the Bible tells us in the

15
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:28,040
Old Testament that the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth forth

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,080
his handiwork. We find that in Psalm 19, but the full revelation of God is given to us

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,879
in the precious word of God, and I'm thankful that God has made himself known. In this record

18
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,360
that is before us in Matthew chapter number one, we find that Matthew is providing us

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,480
with really the conversation, if you will, that takes place between the angel of the

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:56,360
Lord and Joseph regarding the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. In these few verses that

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,040
record the interaction between Joseph and the angel of the Lord, it's very interesting

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,240
that we are given two names for the one whose birth we remember at this time of year. The

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:16,279
incarnation is the term that we use to describe this wonderful birth of Jesus. It's when God

24
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:22,039
was robed in flesh. That's what the word incarnation means. Notice with me in verse

25
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,639
number 18 of Matthew 1, the Bible says this, the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise,

26
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:36,759
when as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with

27
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:44,320
child of the Holy Ghost. What a great miracle, the virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,199
Verse 19, then Joseph, her husband, being a just man, not willing to make her a public

29
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:56,279
example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold,

30
00:02:56,279 --> 00:03:02,399
the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream. Notice this conversation, this instruction

31
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:08,440
that the angel gives to Joseph. The angel says, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,839
to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

33
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:24,639
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,119
his people from their sins. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was

35
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:35,740
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,119
bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is

37
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:47,979
God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden

38
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:54,339
him and took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn

39
00:03:54,339 --> 00:04:02,000
son, and he called his name Jesus. In verse number 21, you see the Bible says, and thou

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,240
shalt call his name Jesus, and then in verse number 23, the second name that is given in

41
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,720
this passage of Scripture, it says that they shall call his name Emmanuel. This morning

42
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,160
we'll focus on verse number 21, this afternoon we'll focus on verse number 23, but we find

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,799
that in this text of Scripture, the Bible reveals to us this name Jesus. What a wonderful

44
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:36,200
name it is. We find that the word Jesus literally means Jehovah is salvation. That's what the

45
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,000
name Jesus means. And think about the tie that God would be given with that name to

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,440
the Old Testament Jehovah God, the self-existent one, the one that made himself known to his

47
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,200
people Israel. He's now saying, the angel of the Lord says to Joseph, thou shalt call

48
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:04,959
his name Jesus. Jehovah is salvation. We understand the incarnation when God was robed

49
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,880
in flesh, the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, that God came to this earth and he became

50
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,959
a man. He never stopped being God. He is the God-man. He's 100% God, 100% man. It's a great

51
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,480
truth of God's word. And I'm so thankful that he came. If you were to read the book of Hebrews

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,720
in the second chapter, you will find that he came and he made himself, took upon himself

53
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,559
the form of a man, the seed of Abraham. Why? So that he could redeem us. That's the only

54
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:44,320
way that mankind could be redeemed was by God dying for us. Now think about that, the

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,299
Lord Jesus Christ coming to this sin-cursed world and dying for us. We look at this name

56
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:54,279
Jesus and just a few thoughts this morning that I hope would be a blessing to and encouragement

57
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:03,440
to you. If you are taking notes, number one, Jesus, number one, Jesus is a prophetic name,

58
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,799
is a prophetic name. Why shalt thou call his name Jesus? Well, the text of scripture tells

59
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:14,320
us that in verse number 21, as the angel of the Lord is giving this message to Joseph,

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,600
the Bible says in verse number 21, and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:31,440
his name Jesus. Why? For he shall save his people from their sins. Oh, that's a prophetic

62
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,040
name, the name of Jesus. We begin to understand that even at the very announcement of the

63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,640
birth of Jesus Christ, that the purpose for his birth is in plain view. The choir sang

64
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,839
to start our service this morning, born to die. We understand that before the foundation

65
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,200
of the world, the Bible tells us that Jesus is the lamb that is slain before the foundation

66
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,600
of the world. And we understand that when he came to this earth, when he was born, this

67
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,200
time of year that we celebrate, that even at the announcement of his birth, as Joseph

68
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,160
was pondering these things and trying to figure out what was going on, and God in his grace

69
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,720
and mercy allowed that angel to show up and speak to Joseph and say, thou shalt call his

70
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:26,119
name Jesus. Why? For he, Jesus, this one that's going to be born, he shall save his

71
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:35,040
people from their sins. How is he going to accomplish that? Well, I'm glad that you asked.

72
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,440
We find that the Bible, as I've mentioned already, has given us great truth and revealed

73
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,239
to us the plan of God. And as I've mentioned that Jesus is a prophetic name, we find that

74
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:52,799
the saving from sins that is referenced with regard to the name Jesus would be accomplished

75
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:59,399
through the death, burial, and glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. We think about the

76
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,640
birth of Christ, I'm so thankful that he came, but we understand that we do not worship a

77
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,519
babe in a manger. We find that though he went to that cruel cross and he bled and he died,

78
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,559
he's no longer on the cross and we have an empty cross because he went to a borrowed

79
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:22,239
tomb and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave. The Bible tells us that 40 days

80
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:27,279
later after his resurrection that he ascended up into heaven, the disciples were there and

81
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,000
witnessed this wonderful account, and the Bible tells us that he ever liveth to make

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,960
intercession for us. The story's not over one day, one glorious day, he's coming back

83
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,440
and what a great day that's going to be. But as we focus this morning upon this prophetic

84
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:51,440
name Jesus that Joseph is given this word from the angel that he shall save his people

85
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,039
from their sins. Notice what the Bible says, turn over if you will to the book of Galatians,

86
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,440
we'll look at just a few verses of scripture this morning to help us to really understand

87
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:11,599
this prophetic name Jesus. In the book of Galatians in the fourth chapter, we find that

88
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:19,080
the Bible will tell us, reveal to us the same truth that we're dealing with of the purpose

89
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,159
of Christ's birth, his name Jesus being prophetic. In Galatians 4, in verse number 4, the Bible

90
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:35,719
says, but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman,

91
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:41,440
made under the law. Notice why, notice in verse number 5, to redeem them that were under

92
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,679
the law that we might receive the adoption of sons. How we find in Matthew, it says his

93
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,039
name shall be called Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins. As Paul is writing

94
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,599
to these churches in Galatia, he says that God sent forth his son at the appointed time

95
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,000
when the...

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,440
fullness of time was come right when God had given the prophecy with regard to the birth

97
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,720
of Christ, and He sent forth His Son, for what purpose?

98
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,460
To redeem them.

99
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,479
The Bible tells us that redemption comes only through the blood of Christ.

100
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:21,040
What a great truth, and you don't need to turn there, I'll read the verse of scripture

101
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,159
for you, but in Colossians chapter number 1 and verse number 14, the Bible says,

102
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:33,840
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

103
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,560
Wow, how that verse of scripture in Colossians 1 and verse number 14 brings the truth of

104
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:48,159
Matthew 121 and Galatians 4-5 together and helps us to understand that redemption alone

105
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,240
through Jesus Christ, through His precious blood.

106
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,479
You see, all mankind has a sin problem.

107
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,759
It's a universal condition.

108
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:04,480
The Bible says back in Genesis chapter number 3 that Satan came as a serpent into that garden.

109
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,199
He was more subtle than any beast of the field.

110
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:12,760
The Bible tells us that when he entered into that garden, he challenged what God had said.

111
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,720
He says, Yea, hath God said.

112
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,879
Then later he says, Ye shall not surely die.

113
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,480
We find that Eve partook of that forbidden fruit and then gave to her husband, Eve, and

114
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,319
at that moment, sin entered into the world.

115
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:34,160
The Bible tells us in the book of Romans in the fifth chapter that all have sinned.

116
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,160
It says that just as Adam has sinned, sin has been passed on in Romans chapter number

117
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
3, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,879
All means all, and that's all that all means, that's what a professor of mine told me in

119
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,879
Bible college.

120
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,279
What a simple statement, but how precious the truth is.

121
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,720
Sin is a universal condition.

122
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:04,639
Every single person has this issue of sin, but the remedy is Jesus, the blood of Christ.

123
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,839
And we find that the prophetic name of Jesus, that He came for the purpose of saving His

124
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,199
people from their sins, and I'm so thankful that the greatest need of mankind is to be

125
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,679
saved from their sins.

126
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,440
If our greatest need was to receive education, God would have sent an educator.

127
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,520
If our greatest need, you can just continue to fill in the blank, but the greatest need,

128
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,520
oh, Jesus taught, He was a great preacher, but our greatest need is salvation because

129
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,240
we have a sin problem.

130
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,139
See there's nothing you can do to atone for your sin.

131
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,360
There's nothing that I can do to atone for my sin.

132
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Oh, we find that there are countless ways in which mankind has come up with on how they

133
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,919
might think that they could handle this problem of sin, and they think that perhaps they could

134
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,800
do good works, they could do this, that, or the other thing, and we find that all of that

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,199
is foreign to what God's Word teaches.

136
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,919
For by grace are you saved through faith, that's what the Bible says.

137
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,919
It is a gift.

138
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,720
It says, not of works, lest any man should boast.

139
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:19,119
I'm so thankful that God has revealed to me and to you in His precious Word, the Bible,

140
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:24,479
that I can't earn my way to heaven, and neither can you.

141
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:31,279
Try as you might, do all the good things that you think you could do, and we still fall

142
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
short.

143
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,839
Why?

144
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,559
Because the blood of Christ is the only payment that is accepted for sin.

145
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,279
We find that Jesus came to pay that wonderful price.

146
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,720
We find, again, you don't need to turn there, but in 1 Timothy chapter number one, the Apostle

147
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,539
Paul is giving his testimony, as he shares his testimony in that portion of Scripture,

148
00:13:53,539 --> 00:14:01,000
he says this, this is a faithful saying, a truthful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,

149
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,240
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

150
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
That's what Paul says, that's his testimony.

151
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
So what does he say?

152
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,519
He says this is a true saying, it's a faithful saying, and it's worthy of all acceptation.

153
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,679
Again, the tie back to Matthew chapter one, when that angel of the Lord said to Joseph,

154
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,320
thou shalt call His name Jesus.

155
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,959
Jesus is a prophetic name, why?

156
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:36,000
Because he says He shall save His people from their sins.

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,480
And Paul says He came, Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

158
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,000
Jesus, Jehovah, is salvation.

159
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Peter would say this in Acts 1, excuse me, Acts 4, in verse number 12, he says, there's

160
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,079
no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

161
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,239
What is that name that Peter is referencing?

162
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,720
It's the name of Jesus.

163
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,519
A great miracle had taken place a chapter before, and all of these folks are wondering,

164
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,399
how is this man made whole?

165
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,279
And Peter stands and says, listen, it's not in my name, it's in the name of Jesus Christ

166
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
of Nazareth that this man is made whole.

167
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,959
And then he says, and there's no other name, that name, Jesus.

168
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm so thankful for salvation through Christ.

169
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You know today, I mentioned a moment ago that He ever liveth to make intercession for us,

170
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,839
and that's found in Hebrews 7 and verse number 25, but before the Bible says that statement,

171
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,279
it tells us this, wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto

172
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,359
God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

173
00:15:54,359 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm so thankful that some, I don't even know at this point, 25 years ago, God in His grace

174
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,440
and His mercy revealed to me that I was a sinner and that He was the only Savior.

175
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,839
And 25 years ago, I understood that there was nothing I could do to get to heaven on

176
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:22,160
my own, work as I might, do all the things that they say are good things to do, but I

177
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,760
would fall short.

178
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,399
God graciously revealed the truth to me, and I can testify this morning that He is able

179
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,119
to save.

180
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:38,000
In faith, I cried out, oh God, I know that I'm a sinner, and I know that You're the Savior.

181
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
Would You save me?

182
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,239
The Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

183
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,160
This morning, when we think about the name of Jesus, Joseph is told, thou shalt call

184
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,559
His name Jesus.

185
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,559
Why?

186
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,760
He, Jesus, shall save His people from their sins.

187
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,239
Jesus, number one, is a prophetic name.

188
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:05,600
Let me say this, number two, Jesus is a precious name.

189
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,040
It's a precious name.

190
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
Philippians chapter number two, we'll finish in this passage of Scripture with our last

191
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:19,720
couple of points this morning, here in the book of Philippians in the second chapter.

192
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Jesus is a prophetic name, but Jesus is a precious name.

193
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Oh, those of us that know the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior, how precious

194
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
that name Jesus is.

195
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,640
I hear the name Jesus and I think of all that He is to me and all that He's done for me,

196
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,600
and how wonderful He is.

197
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
He's a precious name.

198
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,480
It grieves me deeply when I hear people use the name of my Savior inappropriately.

199
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,279
When they take the name of my God in vain, it grieves me.

200
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,279
Why?

201
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,179
Because that's Jesus, my Savior.

202
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,239
He loves me and I love Him.

203
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:04,279
We find this morning that when we understand the precious name of Jesus, we know that many

204
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,200
have written songs about how sweet the name Jesus is.

205
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Jesus is the sweetest name I know, the songwriter said, and certainly it is.

206
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,559
Oh, how I love Jesus.

207
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,000
Why?

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,720
Because we know what that name Jesus means and all that it encapsulates.

209
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,880
Remember in Philippians chapter number 2, beginning in verse number 5, the Word of

210
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
God says,

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,619
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God

212
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,440
thought it not robbery to be equal with God.

213
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
But notice what He did.

214
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,719
He made Himself of no reputation.

215
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,900
That's when He came to this earth.

216
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,700
It says here that He took upon Him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness

217
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,880
of men.

218
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,159
He never ceased being God.

219
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,159
How do we know?

220
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:02,599
Remember when He was on the ship, there was a great storm.

221
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,599
He was sleeping.

222
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,080
Why was He sleeping?

223
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Because He was a man.

224
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,080
He needed rest.

225
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,000
But they awoke the Master and they said,

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,320
Master, carest thou not that we perish?

227
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,640
And Jesus, God Almighty in flesh, He came out and He said,

228
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Peace.

229
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,679
I think He raised His hand.

230
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:23,679
Maybe He didn't.

231
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,520
I just in my mind's eye see peace.

232
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,960
Be still.

233
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
What happened?

234
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,719
Immediately, there was a calm.

235
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,400
He's the God man.

236
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,000
It tells us in verse number 8, in being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself.

237
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Wow.

238
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,140
Just that statement right there is so deep.

239
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:58,900
To think that the God of the universe would humble Himself to be robed in flesh so that

240
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,059
you could be saved, so that I could be saved.

241
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,679
could be saved.

242
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:10,459
He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

243
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,739
But here it is.

244
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,419
Jesus is a precious name.

245
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:23,179
Notice in verse number 9, wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name

246
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:26,939
which is above every name.

247
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,299
Oh, the precious name of Jesus.

248
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:35,619
It's interesting, as we think about the truth of Philippians 2 and verse number 9, that

249
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:40,339
the Bible says that he's given him a name which is above every name.

250
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,579
It's a precious name.

251
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,019
When we hear that name Jesus, what is it that you think?

252
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,859
Immediately, when you hear the name Jesus, what comes to your mind?

253
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,839
My Savior, my Redeemer.

254
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,379
I'm so thankful this morning that it's a prophetic name, it's a precious name.

255
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:04,680
But as we continue here in Philippians 2, we see number 3, Jesus is a powerful name.

256
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a powerful name, prophetic.

257
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,299
He shall save his people from their sins.

258
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,759
It's a precious name.

259
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,000
God hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name.

260
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,839
Verse number 10, it is a powerful name.

261
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:26,759
Notice what the Bible says, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things

262
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:34,379
in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, that every tongue should confess

263
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:41,000
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

264
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,119
Wow, wow.

265
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:50,319
There's an aspect of prophecy in these verses of Scripture as well, but I know the powerful

266
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,799
nature of the name of Jesus.

267
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:59,119
In verse number 10, it says that every knee should bow.

268
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,040
That means every knee.

269
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,799
Every knee.

270
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,360
Not most, but every knee.

271
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
You say, well, there's some people I know.

272
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,440
Every knee.

273
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:21,880
Every knee should bow of things in heaven, things on earth, and things under the earth.

274
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:32,360
Notice verse 11, that every tongue, every tongue, not most, every tongue, should what?

275
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:42,679
Confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father, that he is Messiah,

276
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,679
the promised one.

277
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:52,559
All of the Old Testament prophecies that he is who he claimed to be, he's God.

278
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:59,520
We find here, when we consider the truth of this, these two verses of Scripture, the power

279
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,839
in the name of Jesus, that every knee should bow and every tongue should confess.

280
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,080
I've often, as I looked at this portion of Scripture, I've often said over the years

281
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:16,080
that really it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

282
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,119
Because every knee is going to bow, and every tongue is going to confess.

283
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,679
It's not a matter of if, it will happen.

284
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,679
It's a matter of when.

285
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,119
Preacher, what do you mean by that?

286
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,160
Here's the truth of God's Word.

287
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,080
When makes all the difference.

288
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,880
On August 31st, 1997, I bowed my knee, and with my tongue I confessed that Jesus was

289
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Lord.

290
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,360
And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, Christ alone.

291
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,279
Not Christ plus anything.

292
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,839
Not Christ and my works, not Christ and baptism, not Christ and the Lord's Supper, no, Christ

293
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:05,360
alone.

294
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,599
I bowed my knee, and with my tongue I made confession, and I believed on the Lord Jesus

295
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,599
Christ.

296
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,759
I received Him as my personal Savior.

297
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:21,119
I received that gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

298
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:30,959
Because I did that when I did, I'm still alive today, so I did it on this side of eternity.

299
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:35,200
That means for all of eternity I will live with my Savior.

300
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,679
Why?

301
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,639
Because He saved me, and He gave me the gift of God, which is eternal life.

302
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:49,279
And so for all of eternity, I'll be with my Savior.

303
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,899
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

304
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:58,399
Many here this morning, I know your testimonies personally, and you too bowed your knee to

305
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,079
Christ, and you with your tongue confessed that He's Lord, and you received Him as your

306
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,600
personal Savior on this side of eternity.

307
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,119
And therefore you'll spend eternity with Him.

308
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,679
What a great truth of God's Word.

309
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,399
The Bible reveals to us in the book of Revelation that there is a judgment that will one day

310
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,480
come.

311
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,160
The judgment is the great white throne judgment.

312
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:34,320
The Bible speaks of that judgment as being a final judgment, and one in which the words

313
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,959
depart from me that are cast in the lake of fire.

314
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:43,760
The sentence is the second death.

315
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,600
The Bible says of those that have confessed Christ as their Savior that the second death

316
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,600
hath no power on them.

317
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,760
What a wonderful truth.

318
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,720
When I say that when makes all the difference, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of

319
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,119
when, because at the great white throne judgment, every single person that did not bow their

320
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:14,359
knee or confess with their tongue on this side of eternity will at that judgment bow

321
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,559
their knee and confess with their tongue that Jesus is Lord.

322
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,119
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, and when makes all the difference.

323
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,200
Because when they bow their knee and with their tongue make confession at the great

324
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,220
white throne judgment, it's eternally too late.

325
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,639
They will still be cast in the lake of fire.

326
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,880
You say, preacher, that's sad.

327
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
It is.

328
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:49,480
It's unfortunate that anyone, God didn't create you to send you to a lake of fire.

329
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,239
He created you because He loves you and He wants to save you.

330
00:26:54,239 --> 00:27:00,440
For many here this morning, you've trusted Christ as your Savior, but maybe, just maybe,

331
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,119
there's someone here this morning that has never trusted Christ as their Savior.

332
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,480
Maybe you've been taught some other form of teaching that you need to be a good person

333
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,440
or do good things or whatever else it might be.

334
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,200
But the authority of the Word of God, the Bible plainly teaches, for by grace are you

335
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040
saved through faith.

336
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,799
It tells us that in Ephesians chapter number 2, and that not of yourselves, it's the gift

337
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,279
of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

338
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,279
And we rejoice in understanding the truth of the Word of God this morning.

339
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:42,200
At the very announcement for the one whose birth we celebrate this season, the name

340
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,239
Jesus was given.

341
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:49,320
Thou shalt call His name Jesus.

342
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Oh, that's a prophetic name.

343
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,200
He shall save His people from their sins.

344
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,359
Oh, it's a precious name.

345
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,200
Indeed, I agree with the songwriter, it is the sweetest name I know.

346
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,040
It's a powerful name.

347
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:08,519
This morning, if you've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

348
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,519
why not today?

349
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:17,320
Paul says in writing to the church in Corinth in 2 Corinthians, he says, behold, today is

350
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,320
the day of salvation.

351
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,799
Today is the day of salvation.

352
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:27,799
Again, the powerful name of Jesus, every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going

353
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,480
to confess.

354
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,919
Not if, but when.

355
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:39,320
And if you've not done that yet today, God extends to you an open invitation.

356
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,119
He says, I love you and I died for you.

357
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,880
You're celebrating my birth, but I was born to die.

358
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,119
I was born, I came because I loved you.

359
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,760
And the only way you could be redeemed was through my death, my precious blood, my burial

360
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,520
and my resurrection.

361
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,119
And today I offer to you this wonderful gift of eternal life.

362
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,679
Oh, this morning, if you've already received that gift, I hope you'd rejoice greatly in

363
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,000
being reminded this morning of how wonderful the name of Jesus is and how grateful we are

364
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,039
that someone took the time to tell us about Jesus.

365
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,840
But if you've not been saved, oh, I plead with you this morning, don't let another day

366
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,599
go by without knowing for sure that heaven is your home.

367
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,880
We'd love to take a Bible.

368
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,799
I've already told you everything you need to know.

369
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,760
Love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

370
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,200
The Bible tells us, for whosoever, that means anybody, fill in your name.

371
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,919
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

372
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,039
Saved from what?

373
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,039
My sins.

374
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,719
Remember the name Jesus?

375
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,119
He shall save his people.

376
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,719
from their sins. Oh, what a wonderful Savior we have. Let's pray together. Father, we love

377
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:12,079
You. Oh, how we thank You for loving us. We thank You for this time of year that we can

378
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:22,119
remember the incarnation when God was robed in flesh. Oh, how grateful we are for the

379
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:29,879
name Jesus. It's a prophetic name. It's a precious name. It's a powerful name. I thank

380
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:36,439
You for saving me. I thank You for the many that are here that have shared with me personally

381
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:41,319
their testimony that they have trusted Christ as their Savior. They recognize they were

382
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:50,959
a sinner and Jesus is the only Savior. You called out and You saved them. God, maybe

383
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:57,279
there's one here this morning. It's not sure of heaven. I remember being in that place.

384
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:06,119
I remember the days of sitting in a church and hearing the preaching and having no assurance

385
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:14,879
because I had not yet trusted Christ as my Savior, hoping that when I died I'd go to

386
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:22,919
heaven. But now I'm so thankful after knowing the truth of Your Word, receiving the gift

387
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:33,199
of God which is eternal life, there's a confidence, an assurance that heaven is my home. God,

388
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:37,879
I pray that You'd move and work. The Holy Spirit of God would take the Word of God and

389
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:42,519
minister as only You can. We'll be careful to give You the honor and glory for every

390
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:50,079
decision that is made. For it's in the wonderful, precious name of Jesus we do pray. Would You

391
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:56,799
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. No one's looking around. At the end of each

392
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,359
of our services we have a time of invitation. We extend to an invitation to respond to the

393
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:11,279
message. This morning if you've trusted Christ, maybe you want to come to this altar and just

394
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,959
thank Him for being your Savior. Maybe this morning you've never been saved. Maybe this

395
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:25,360
morning you need to come and trust Christ as your personal Savior. As Kimberly plays,

396
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,399
the altar is open.
