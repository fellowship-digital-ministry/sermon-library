1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
2 from the message this morning. If you were here this morning, we looked at this first

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,720
portion of this message. We'll look at Part 2 this evening, but certainly thankful for

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,819
this very familiar psalm, Psalm 23. I will read it again this evening. Again, it's familiar

4
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:20,239
to us, but notice with me in Psalm 23, the Lord would use David as the human penman of

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,040
this wonderful, familiar psalm. The Bible says,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,319
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures,

7
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:34,880
he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul, he leadeth me in the paths

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,759
of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:46,040
of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod, thy staff, they comfort

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,479
me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my

11
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,740
head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,979
days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

13
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,699
I said this morning, as we looked at this first portion or this first part of this message,

14
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,459
that often in our lives we've heard people use the metaphor as they've sought to try

15
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,379
to speak about someone being an optimist or a pessimist. And they've said, and they've

16
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:23,180
used this metaphor, do you look at the cup as being half full or half empty? And many

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,139
of us have heard that before and we've been familiar with that. But I said this this morning

18
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:33,580
that as a child of God, I'm thankful that my cup's not half full, it's not half empty,

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,620
my cup runneth over. And we find at the end of verse number 5 this great declaration where

20
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,379
the psalmist says, very simply, my cup runneth over. I think about the imagery of this verse

21
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:49,459
of scripture, of this statement of this verse of scripture and how it reveals to us the

22
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:56,540
goodness of God in our lives. And it's not even that it's just full, it's running over.

23
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,180
And our God daily loads us with benefits, He's so good to us, He's been so gracious

24
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,460
and so kind to us, and we are blessed. And we ought to go through life with this perspective,

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,740
my cup runneth over. So often people ask you, I mean it's just a normal routine of being

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,179
asked as you interact with people in life, hey, how are you? How's your day? How are

27
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:24,779
things going? And as people, the people of God that understand the Word of God, truly

28
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:31,500
this evening our answer could be, my cup runneth over. I've been blessed beyond measure and

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,979
so have you. This morning we looked at five truths, biblical truths that should lead every

30
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:44,619
child of God to saying, my cup runneth over. We said this, number one, because my shepherd

31
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:49,460
loves me. And I said this, that'd be enough. If that was the only thing that we could speak

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,660
of, that my shepherd loves me, it'd be enough. But we said my shepherd loves me, my shepherd

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,660
died for me, my shepherd, he found me. He found me. Aren't you thankful that he found

34
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,899
you? I don't know where he found you, but I know where he found me. And I know I wasn't

35
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:11,860
seeking for him. Many times you'll hear people say, I found the Lord, and truly it's the

36
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:19,460
Lord that found us. We looked at the fact that he cares for us. He didn't say that

37
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,740
we're to cast our burden upon the Lord and he might sustain us. He didn't even say that

38
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,899
he can sustain us. He said he shall sustain us. And then we said this, he provides for

39
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:34,820
us. My shepherd provides for me. And we talked about his provision. I made it abundantly

40
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,059
clear that though he provides for all of our needs and the reality is most of our wants,

41
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:46,500
for us this evening, that would be true. But we find this evening that our greatest

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:54,100
need, the greatest need of mankind is to be saved. It's salvation, it's redemption, reconciliation.

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,740
And we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, my shepherd, he provides for me my greatest need,

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,220
a need that could be met by no other, only through the Lord Jesus Christ. This evening

45
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,740
we're going to look at five additional reasons that we can look to that will help us have

46
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:16,579
this perspective as we go through life. My cup runneth over. Why do we need this perspective?

47
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,380
Because you're going to deal with problems this week. You're going to have issues this

48
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,179
week. Things aren't going to go right this week and you're going to get discouraged and

49
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,299
you're going to get overwhelmed and you're going to get down. But the reality is that

50
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:31,299
in the midst of all of those things, what I'm sharing with you this evening and this

51
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:36,899
morning are biblical truths that do not change. Your circumstances, they're going to change.

52
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,899
Your feelings, they're going to change. But it's not going to change the fact that Jesus

53
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,779
loves you. It's not going to change the fact that you're heaven bound. And we'll look at

54
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:48,059
a number of these things this evening and I hope that it would help us as we go through

55
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:52,739
those disappointments of life, those trials and troubles that we'll endure, that we can

56
00:04:52,739 --> 00:05:00,380
still say, my cup runneth over. Because in verse number five of Psalm 23, it starts by

57
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:08,019
speaking about, thou preparest a table before me, what? In the presence of mine enemies.

58
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:14,540
In the presence of mine enemies. But yet David was able to say, my cup runneth over. My cup

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,119
runneth over. Number six or number one, however you want to take the notes, it's the sixth

60
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:26,579
one on the list of ten and this evening it would be this, my shepherd leads me. My shepherd

61
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,459
leads me. I'm thankful for God's leadership. I'm thankful that at times in my life and

62
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:37,179
at times in your life, no doubt, we are lacking a direction. We are lacking an understanding

63
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:41,700
of what the next steps are and what we're to do. And we find this evening that sheep

64
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,420
need leadership. Sheep need direction. And I'm thankful this evening that my sheep, or

65
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,179
my shepherd, he leads me. Here in Psalm 23, in verse number three, the Bible says, he

66
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:57,500
restoreth my soul. We'll look at verse number two. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

67
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,019
Notice he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the

68
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:10,619
paths of righteousness for his namesake. I'm thankful for God's leadership in my life.

69
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:16,299
I'm thankful at times, no doubt, we are tempted to lean on our own understanding. We're looking

70
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:21,779
at the events that are before us and decisions that we must face, but we must recognize the

71
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,779
importance of following the leadership that our shepherd provides us with. This evening,

72
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,220
as we begin to think about the leadership that our shepherd provides us with, I'm thankful

73
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,140
that he's given us his word, how precious the Bible is. And he says, thy word is a lamp

74
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,739
unto my feet and it's a light unto my path. No doubt, many of us here this evening, there's

75
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:47,859
some children in the room, so they've not actually had the opportunity to drive a vehicle,

76
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:52,980
but most of them have driven in a vehicle, and so they would understand this analogy

77
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,420
as well. But for those of us that drive, you're going to leave tonight. In fact, many of you

78
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,899
came here tonight and you had your headlights on. It's getting dark earlier, right? But

79
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:07,540
you know, when you left your house this evening, your lights did not shine, because I didn't

80
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,660
drive here, I walked, right? So it doesn't count for my car being over there, all right?

81
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,540
But when you left your house this evening, your headlights did not illuminate Fellowship

82
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,579
Baptist Church. They don't shine that far. They just shine enough in front of you to

83
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:32,260
be able to get where you're going. Eventually, you pulled up that driveway and your headlights

84
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:40,600
illuminate your destination, correct? Some of you live a lot of miles away. And the number

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,720
of miles, we used to live 19 miles from here. My headlights didn't shine 19 miles. They

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,679
shine just far enough ahead to be able to get where I needed to go and eventually reach

87
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:58,480
the destination. You know, God provides us with that kind of leadership. He leads us

88
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,359
day by day, step by step. Some people say, well, I want to know what I'm going to do

89
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:06,119
in 20 years. No, no, just be concerned about what you're doing today, what God has for

90
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:12,299
you today. And He leads us, and I'm thankful for His leadership. He's given us His Word,

91
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:17,440
and His Word is a guide for us. I'm thankful for the Holy Spirit of God who indwells us,

92
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,320
who guides us and leads us. And so this evening, when I think about this truth that my cup

93
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,640
runneth over, I say one of the reasons that that's true is because my shepherd, he leads

94
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:34,280
me. Number seven, my shepherd protects me. You know, we need divine protection. The Bible

95
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,039
says that the horse is prepared for the day of battle, but safety, safety is of the Lord.

96
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,960
And this evening, we understand that we live, and the reality is that for centuries and

97
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,280
millennia we find that we've lived in a sin-cursed world where evil is all around and abounds.

98
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,200
And I know at times we are tempted to think it's never been as bad as it is today. Just

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,380
read some history and you'll find out that there have been plenty of times in history

100
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,299
that it's actually been worse than it is today. And the reality, however, is that

101
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:11,659
we need God's protection. The sheep, they need protection. And the shepherd provides

102
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:16,880
protection for His sheep. And our shepherd is a good shepherd, and our shepherd provides

103
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,380
us with that protection. We see in verse number four, the Bible says this in Psalm 23 and

104
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,979
verse four, Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, notice, I will

105
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:32,299
fear no evil. Why? For Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. I

106
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,979
think about this, turn over to John 10, and we looked at a number of verses this morning

107
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:41,739
in John 10, and we'll look there again this evening for this particular point, this thought.

108
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:46,340
But look at John 10, and we'll look at verses 11 through 14, and consider this evening the

109
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,260
way that the shepherd, my shepherd, He protects me. Often we think about protection, and we

110
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:58,940
are aware of the fact when we see some tragic circumstance or situation, how God may have

111
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,900
protected us.

112
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,300
But the reality is, there's many times in your life and my life that God has protected

113
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,740
us from things and we're not even aware of it.

114
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
We have absolutely no idea.

115
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,700
You know, sometimes we get disappointed about delays, don't we?

116
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
We get frustrated.

117
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,160
We want to get on the road at a certain time.

118
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
We hit traffic.

119
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,740
We this, that, so on and so forth.

120
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,240
And then all of a sudden, occasionally, it's happened in my life that God will allow me

121
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,020
to get a little ways up the road and I'll see a terrible accident.

122
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
And I'll have that thought.

123
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,140
You know what, Armando, if I had left when I wanted to leave, it's very possible and

124
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,980
likely that I would have been right in the midst of that particular accident.

125
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,060
But we can get so frustrated.

126
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,460
God's protection, it comes in a variety of ways.

127
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,900
Look at John 10 and verse number 11.

128
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,240
The Bible says this, I am the good shepherd.

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,700
The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep, but he that is an hireling and not

130
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,780
the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and what does he do?

131
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,140
He leaves the sheep.

132
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
Seriously?

133
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,620
Yeah, that's what the hireling does.

134
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,260
That's what he does.

135
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
He leaves.

136
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Why?

137
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Because there's danger.

138
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
And he leaves.

139
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,860
But notice, it says this, and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the

140
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,160
sheep.

141
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,580
Verse 13, the hireling fleeth, why?

142
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,340
Because he's a hireling.

143
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,660
And notice this, and careth not for the sheep.

144
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,300
Our fourth point this morning was that my shepherd cares for me.

145
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,300
We find in verse number 14, notice what he says, I am the good shepherd and know my sheep

146
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,100
and am known of mine.

147
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,060
As we look through this portion of Scripture, we find that he speaks of the hireling and

148
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,140
the way that the hireling flees when that enemy comes, when that wolf comes.

149
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,900
But I want you to know this evening that our shepherd, he protects us.

150
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,020
He's a good shepherd.

151
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,460
He stays and he protects and he gives us what we need.

152
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,420
You know, at times, he protects me from me.

153
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,980
He protects me from me, and he protects you from you.

154
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Amen?

155
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,740
I hope you're willing to admit that tonight, because sometimes, you know, I think it was

156
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:15,020
D.L. Moody, he said, the worst enemy I have is the man whose face I shave each morning.

157
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,620
Sometimes we're our worst enemy, and sometimes in life, God protects me from me.

158
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,180
Even terrible decisions, amen?

159
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,620
Not waiting on the Lord, not seeking God's face, responding in situations where really

160
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,220
we'd say it's not really responding, it's reacting.

161
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,940
We just get hasty and what have you, but God, see, our shepherd, he leads me.

162
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,420
He protects me.

163
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,020
Number eight this evening, my shepherd intercedes for me, intercedes for me.

164
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,140
I'm so thankful that the Bible teaches us that the Lord Jesus Christ, he took my place

165
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,580
on that cross of Calvary, but he was buried in a borrowed tomb, and he didn't stay there.

166
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,140
He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

167
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,320
He lives forevermore, but the Bible teaches us that he lives and he makes intercession

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
for us.

169
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,540
Notice in Hebrews 7 and verse number 25, a precious truth of God's Word is contained

170
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,060
within this single verse of Scripture, and I'm thankful that he's our intercessor and

171
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,080
that he makes intercession for us.

172
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,560
And I think about Peter, you know, Peter is probably one of the disciples that most

173
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,720
of us can relate well to.

174
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,380
We can think about Peter and we can think about so many things, and man, there are times

175
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,800
in which we can look at his life and we can read the records of what took place, and man,

176
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,120
he is just, he is so right, and he is just, man, he is right on the mark.

177
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,720
And then other times you read Peter and you kind of scratch your head and say, what was

178
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
he thinking?

179
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
What was he doing?

180
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,880
I mean, it was great when Peter said, Lord, if it's thee, bid me come to thee.

181
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
And he walked on the water, what great faith!

182
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,120
But then he says to the other disciples in John 20, he says, I'm going fishing.

183
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,760
You say, what's going on, Peter?

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,100
But we find that Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, he's speaking to Peter and he tells Peter

185
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,360
about denying the Lord.

186
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,520
And Jesus tells him this, he says that Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift

187
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
you as wheat.

188
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,480
But then there's a precious, precious truth, but I have prayed for thee.

189
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Wow.

190
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
I have prayed for thee.

191
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
And notice in Hebrews 7 and verse 25, the Bible says, wherefore, he is able also to

192
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

193
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm thankful for that salvation, but he says, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession

194
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,800
for them.

195
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,560
We find that in Romans 8 and verse 34, the Bible teaches us again this very truth that

196
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,000
we find here in Hebrews 7 and verse 25, where the Bible says, who is it that condemneth?

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,160
It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand

198
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,880
of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

199
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,060
My shepherd intercedes for me.

200
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,440
That should lead me to say my cup runneth over.

201
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,340
I mean, this is, these are, see, so often we think about counter-blessing, sometimes

202
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,360
we think about tangible, earthly, temporal, no, no, we want to get on a different plane

203
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,740
because those things are going to come and go.

204
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,380
Solomon says, wealth, it makes wings and flies away.

205
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,260
But these truths that we look at this evening and this morning as well, these are truths

206
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,140
that endure.

207
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,180
These are truths that are never going to change, that you and I, this evening and throughout

208
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,760
this week and this upcoming year, we never know what's going to come down our road and

209
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,720
what we're going to deal with, but we can say with the psalmist, and truly it is true

210
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,720
in our lives, that my cup runneth over.

211
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,920
My cup runneth over.

212
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,320
Number nine, my shepherd is preparing a place for me.

213
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
That's exciting.

214
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
It's really exciting.

215
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,700
John 14, Jesus had just spent time with the disciples and in the 13th chapter, he washed

216
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,020
their feet and gave them just great truth and lessons, and he had been explaining to

217
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,760
them for some time how he would go to the cross of Calvary.

218
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,980
He says at the end of the chapter, the 13th chapter, now is the Son of Man glorified and

219
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,300
God is glorified in him, and he goes through and he provides them with this information,

220
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,180
but then he begins the 14th chapter and he says, let not your heart be troubled.

221
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,620
What a wonderful statement.

222
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,780
Jesus knowing the disciples and knowing their hearts and he knows your heart as well.

223
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,140
There are times, if you'd be honest, your heart's troubled, but Jesus says, let not

224
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,860
your heart be troubled.

225
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,500
You believe in God, believe also in me.

226
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,100
And then he says this in verse number two, in my father's house are many mansions.

227
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,280
If it were not so, I would have told you, but then notice he says, I go to prepare a

228
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,640
place for you.

229
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,680
You think about that just for a moment.

230
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,640
He's preparing a place for us.

231
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,800
It's absolutely amazing when you consider the blessings that he's bestowed upon us here.

232
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,640
He's been so good to us.

233
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,720
We think about all of these wonderful truths that we look at throughout today and understand

234
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,400
that we say, my cup runneth over, but we find that my shepherd at this moment, yes, he ever

235
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,560
liveth to make intercession for us, but he says, I go to prepare a place for you.

236
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,400
See this world is not my home.

237
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
Aren't you thankful for that?

238
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,220
Mr. Orgina and Mr. Don came up here the other day.

239
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,040
They pulled up in the driveway and we were chatting for a moment and we're speaking about

240
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,200
a few things and they shared something and we're just kind of talking.

241
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,760
And I said, you know, one of the things that reminds me, I'm so thankful.

242
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,280
This world is not my home.

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm just a passing through, amen.

244
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,600
And the reality is that we look at the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter, he talks about

245
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
we're pilgrims and we're strangers.

246
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

247
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,840
I don't know when I'm getting there, but I know where I'm going.

248
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,720
I know that I'm going home.

249
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,600
And the Bible teaches me that my shepherd is preparing a place for me.

250
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
And listen, he doeth all things well, amen.

251
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
He doesn't cut any corners.

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,960
He does all things well.

253
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,840
And I'm looking forward to heaven and I'm looking forward.

254
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
And listen, understand with me, I mentioned it this morning and I'll mention it again

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,880
here in just a little while, but the reality is that heaven is heaven because of the presence

256
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,560
of Jesus.

257
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,280
It's not just because he's preparing a place for us, but it's that he's preparing a place

258
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,440
for us that where he is, there we may be also.

259
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,680
And that's powerful.

260
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:48,480
And listen, on your worst day and on my worst day, I'm not going to hell.

261
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm going to heaven.

262
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
And my shepherd is preparing a place for me.

263
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,000
And that should cause me to say in the midst of however terrible it is, my cup runneth

264
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
over.

265
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why?

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,080
Because my shepherd's preparing a place for me.

267
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,680
It's like the day that I said to the man that I was doing wonderful and he told me I was

268
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,360
lying to him.

269
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,480
And so I'm going to heaven.

270
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,200
If you're going to heaven, not only you're wonderful, but your cup is running over.

271
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,880
Number 10, we're going to spend some time on this one.

272
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,400
My shepherd is coming back for me.

273
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,040
My shepherd's coming back for me.

274
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,059
Listen, no one is going to prevent Jesus from coming back.

275
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,200
He's going to come back right on time.

276
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,280
And he's coming for me.

277
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,640
In the same passage of scripture in John 14, we see in verse 2, he says, I go to prepare

278
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
a place for you.

279
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,640
But he says this in verse number 3, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come

280
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,160
again.

281
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,680
And notice he says, receive you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also.

282
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,059
He's coming back for me.

283
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,200
He knows what we're going through.

284
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,920
He knows what we're in trouble with.

285
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,140
enduring and he knows why he's left us here.

286
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,740
Listen, there are times in which people will have the idea,

287
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,160
why are we here, what's going on?

288
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,740
God has a purpose for us.

289
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,860
God has a plan for us.

290
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,820
The Bible says that the Lord is not slack

291
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
concerning his promise.

292
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,300
In the context of 2 Peter chapter three,

293
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,980
the promise that is being spoken of

294
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,060
is the promise of his return.

295
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,980
And there are scoffers and there are mockers

296
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,700
and they're saying, where is he?

297
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,860
All things continue as they always have been.

298
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,940
And the Bible says that the Lord is not slack

299
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,500
concerning his promise to us, word,

300
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,620
but is long suffering to us, word,

301
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,320
not willing that any should perish,

302
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,640
but that all should come to repentance.

303
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,040
And so we find this evening that my shepherd,

304
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,020
he's coming back for me.

305
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,940
Now, this truth should encourage every child of God.

306
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,780
It should comfort us to know that our shepherd

307
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,500
is coming back for us and to know,

308
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,060
listen, I don't know the hour, I don't know the day,

309
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,640
but I know that as you see what's taking place

310
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,620
in our world, when you look at all that's taking place,

311
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,300
we know that it's getting closer.

312
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,100
It's closer today than it was yesterday, amen.

313
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,300
And we find here in Acts chapter number one,

314
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,140
look over there.

315
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,380
And I want you to think about not only the comfort

316
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,880
that this truth provides for you and I,

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,100
the comfort that it gives us and the reason

318
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,020
that we should say my cup runneth over

319
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,060
because he's coming back for me.

320
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,360
He's not going to forsake us.

321
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,900
And we find here that this not only comforts us,

322
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,520
but it ought to motivate us.

323
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,520
I don't know when he's coming back and neither do you,

324
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,580
but I know one thing, 1 John 3 speaks of this,

325
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,420
I don't want to be ashamed of his appearing.

326
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,500
I don't want to be ashamed of his appearing.

327
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,100
There's no doubt in my life,

328
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,600
there's been a time in your life,

329
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,460
I know there's been times in my life,

330
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,180
that you've been ashamed that someone's appearing.

331
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,820
Someone left you some instructions,

332
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,020
maybe it was a parent, maybe it was an employer, a boss,

333
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,500
and they left you with some instructions

334
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,340
and you weren't diligent to do what you were supposed to do.

335
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,700
And you were ashamed that they're appearing.

336
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Maybe a teacher.

337
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,980
I don't know what the context would be,

338
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,540
but this evening I don't want to be ashamed

339
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,460
of the appearing of my savior.

340
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,220
I want to be found doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

341
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,700
Notice in Acts 1 and verse number six,

342
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,620
the Bible says when they therefore were come together,

343
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,460
they asked of him saying, Lord,

344
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,980
will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

345
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,660
He said unto them, it is not for you to know the times

346
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,380
or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power,

347
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,820
but you shall receive power

348
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,220
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,

349
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,300
and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

350
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,580
and all Judea and Samaria

351
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,620
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

352
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,380
At times it seems as if we've forgotten

353
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,180
this piece of instruction that the Lord has left us with.

354
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,900
They want to know when the times would be,

355
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,300
and he says it's not for you to know,

356
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,580
but here's what your duty is,

357
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,300
here's what your responsibility is.

358
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,380
Notice in verse number nine,

359
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,740
and when he had spoken these things,

360
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,700
while they beheld, he was taken up

361
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,660
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

362
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,220
While they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up,

363
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,340
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,

364
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,260
which also said, ye men of Galilee,

365
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,820
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

366
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,220
Notice the same Jesus,

367
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,420
which has taken up from you into heaven,

368
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,180
shall so come in like manner

369
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,100
as you have seen him go into heaven.

370
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,660
And so what was the duty here

371
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,100
when you think about the disciples

372
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,020
and hear this record in Acts one,

373
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,580
we find that it's a comforting truth,

374
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,060
but it's also a motivational truth.

375
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,460
Jesus is coming again.

376
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,220
He left them with instruction.

377
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,460
When we read the book of Acts

378
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,260
and we begin to read and unfold

379
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,780
what's happened in the first century

380
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,900
and you begin to see the work

381
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,460
that God is doing through his disciples

382
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,540
and the way in which they,

383
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,500
the Bible says that they filled Jerusalem

384
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,340
with their doctrine,

385
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,220
the Bible says that they turned the world upside down

386
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,500
and you begin to see how that the gospel

387
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,820
is spread through the known world

388
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,780
and all that takes place in the first century

389
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,020
in the book of Acts through God's people.

390
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,460
I believe with all of my heart this evening

391
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,140
that part of the reason for that

392
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,820
is they were motivated by this promise.

393
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,580
He's coming again.

394
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,420
He shall come.

395
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,380
And we find this evening

396
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,540
that we're to understand

397
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,180
that my shepherd is coming back for me.

398
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,220
Notice this, we've seen it not only in John 14

399
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,860
but look in 1 Thessalonians chapter one

400
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,340
because I want you to see in chapter number four,

401
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,980
excuse me, 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

402
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,260
notice with me this evening,

403
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,460
he said I will come again to receive you unto myself

404
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,380
that where I am there you may be also there

405
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,220
in John 14 in Acts one.

406
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,940
We find that he says this same Jesus

407
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,380
which has taken up from you into heaven

408
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,100
shall so come in like manner.

409
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,820
And we find here in 1 Thessalonians four

410
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
in verse number 16,

411
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,980
notice the Bible says for the Lord himself,

412
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,740
some folks still turning,

413
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
let me let you get there,

414
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,660
notice verse 16,

415
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,100
we're jumping right in the middle

416
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,180
of this portion of scripture,

417
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,940
1 Thessalonians four, 13 through 18,

418
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,460
really the whole context of it,

419
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,900
but notice verse 16,

420
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,180
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

421
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,300
with a shout,

422
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,500
with the voice of the archangel,

423
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,340
with the trump of God

424
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,940
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

425
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,780
Then, verse 17,

426
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,060
we which are alive and remain

427
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,260
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

428
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,460
to meet the Lord in the air

429
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,020
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

430
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,260
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

431
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,420
I'm thankful this evening

432
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,580
that Jesus isn't sending an angel for me.

433
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,660
The Lord himself,

434
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
he said I will come again.

435
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,420
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven.

436
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,260
This same Jesus, Acts chapter number one,

437
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,180
which you've seen go,

438
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
he's coming back,

439
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,340
he's not sending somebody for us.

440
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,660
Something different about that.

441
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,620
Something precious about that.

442
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,780
Something exciting about that.

443
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,460
You ever, in a situation

444
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,140
and maybe you're gonna have a meeting with somebody

445
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,820
and they send somebody else out to meet with you.

446
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,420
No, no, I didn't wanna meet with them,

447
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,020
I wanted to meet with you.

448
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,020
Jesus isn't sending an angel,

449
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,340
he's not even sending a Michael.

450
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,220
He's not sending an archangel,

451
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,260
no, he's coming back.

452
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,100
My shepherd is, he's coming for me.

453
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,580
And I'm so thankful for that wonderful truth

454
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,740
that God has given us.

455
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,980
Notice in the book of Titus,

456
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,380
just a few pages over in your Bible,

457
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,060
in Titus chapter number two,

458
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,940
notice what the Bible teaches us here

459
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,260
with regard to this precious truth of his return.

460
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,580
It says here in this portion of scripture

461
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,340
in Titus chapter number two,

462
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,460
and verse number 11,

463
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,740
notice the Bible says for the grace of God

464
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,140
that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,

465
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,660
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts

466
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,100
we shall live soberly, righteously,

467
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,740
and godly in this present world,

468
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,060
looking for that blessed hope,

469
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,620
the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior,

470
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,180
Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us,

471
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,580
that he might redeem us from all iniquity

472
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,740
and purify unto himself a peculiar people,

473
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,420
zealous of good works.

474
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,660
These things speak and exhort and rebuke

475
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,100
with all authority, let no man despise thee.

476
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,660
I'm thankful that he gave himself for me

477
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,180
so that he could redeem me,

478
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,100
but I'm thankful that he's coming back for me.

479
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,140
And this evening, as we begin to look

480
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,620
at the truth of God's word,

481
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,300
the Bible says in 1 Peter 5 and verse number four,

482
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,140
when the chief shepherd shall appear.

483
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,700
The Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews

484
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,020
that when he shall come,

485
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,300
listen, he's not gonna tarry his coming.

486
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,220
Jesus is coming back right on time.

487
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,980
And this evening, when we understand

488
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,380
these wonderful truths that we've examined

489
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,340
throughout the day, five this morning,

490
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,860
five more this evening,

491
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,020
I hope that each of us would leave,

492
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,460
and we're not, I'm thankful as a child of God,

493
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,340
my cup is not half full.

494
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,740
My cup's not half empty.

495
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,540
My cup is running over.

496
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,460
And so is yours.

497
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,540
And I believe this evening that if we would live

498
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,700
with that kind of perspective,

499
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,540
God would give us opportunity to impact some people.

500
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,420
Because there's something different.

501
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,820
Why do you live that way?

502
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,020
Why are you so full of joy?

503
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,980
And why do you have this?

504
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,580
Because of what my God's done for me.

505
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,780
Because he loves me, and he died for me,

506
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,180
and he found me, and he cares about me,

507
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,620
and he provides for me.

508
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,900
And as we've looked this evening,

509
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,860
he leads me, and he protects me,

510
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,460
and he intercedes for me,

511
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,060
and he's preparing a place for me,

512
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,620
and one day he's coming back for me.

513
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,340
Hallelujah.

514
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,220
My cup, my cup runneth over.

515
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
This morning I mentioned about a song,

516
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,820
and I was not, I did not know if anyone

517
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,540
would have any knowledge of the song,

518
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,700
and I know that Mike Clark, a friend of mine has,

519
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,060
he sings the song, and I made comment of it this morning.

520
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,580
The song is titled Drinking From My Saucer.

521
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,140
And it speaks about my cup runneth over,

522
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
and I'm drinking from my saucer,

523
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,260
and Miss Mana said to me when she left this morning,

524
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,580
she said, I have that poem hanging on my refrigerator.

525
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,820
And she brought me a copy of it this evening.

526
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,340
Here's what the author, a man by the name of Bill Anderson,

527
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,380
I don't know the man, I heard Mike Clark sing the song.

528
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,660
Here's what the author says,

529
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,100
I've never made a fortune, and it's probably too late now.

530
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,540
Some of us say, yep, I'm in that same boat, amen.

531
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,020
But I don't worry about that.

532
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,020
Because I'm happy anyhow.

533
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,500
As I journey through this life,

534
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,900
I'm reaping better than I sow.

535
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,780
And I'm drinking from my saucer,

536
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,060
because my cup has overflowed.

537
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,940
I'm not sure about the English of this poem,

538
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,900
but I'm just gonna read it like he wrote it, amen.

539
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,300
I don't have a lot of riches,

540
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,260
and sometimes the going is slow.

541
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,460
tough, but with loving friends and family I feel I'm rich enough. I thank God for

542
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,740
his loving care, the blessings he's bestowed from drinking from my saucer

543
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,820
because my cup has overflowed. Oh I remember when things went wrong and my

544
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,700
faith grew a wee bit thin, but all at once the dark clouds broke and the sun

545
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,620
peeped through again. So Lord help me not to gripe about the tough rows I have

546
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,940
owed from drinking from my saucer because my cup has overflowed. If God

547
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,380
gives me strength and courage when the path grows steep and rough, I'll not ask

548
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,020
for other blessings for I've been blessed enough and may never be too busy

549
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,980
to help another bear his load, for then I'll keep drinking from my saucer

550
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,980
because my cup has overflowed. I just wonder this evening, we lead into this

551
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,980
week of Thanksgiving and of course as God's people we're to be thankful every

552
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,580
day of our lives, not just the month of November, not just the week of

553
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Thanksgiving. The Bible says that we're to give thanks in everything for this is

554
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,820
the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. We're to be a thankful

555
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,100
people. Rejoice evermore. What a simple verse of Scripture in 1st

556
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:27,420
Thessalonians 5. Rejoice evermore. Psalm 118.24, this is the day the Lord hath made.

557
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,140
We will rejoice and be glad in it. The psalmist didn't say this is the day the

558
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,260
Lord hath made, we'll see what happens, we'll see how it goes and then we'll

559
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,220
determine if we'll rejoice or not. No, we will rejoice and be glad in it. This

560
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,100
evening I hope that as we fix our attention for a couple of messages today

561
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:56,340
on a simple statement from Psalm 23 5, my cup runneth over. I said this this

562
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,660
morning, I'll say it again in closing. The list that I gave you, ten things, it's

563
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,980
not exhaustive. You could add so many more things to the list. I challenge you

564
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:13,340
to do that. Why does your cup, why is it running over? You say, I don't think my

565
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:20,380
cup is running over. Get along with God. Get into His Word. Let Him minister your

566
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:27,820
heart because I'm telling you this evening, we should be able to say with all honesty

567
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:36,740
and sincerity, not just repeating empty words, but true from the heart we ought to be able

568
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:44,580
to say with the psalmist, my cup runneth over. My cup runneth over. Let's pray. Father,

569
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:53,460
we thank you for your many blessings. This evening we have so much to be thankful for.

570
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:05,260
We've considered ten truths throughout the day that do not change with my circumstances,

571
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:12,580
with our circumstances, with our feelings, our emotions. They're settled. They're

572
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:19,340
constant. Father, I pray that as we go through life, you'd help us to go day by day with

573
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:27,460
this perspective that my cup runneth over. Help us to live as a blessed people because

574
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:35,500
truly we have been blessed. God, I pray that as we go throughout our busy days and we interact

575
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:44,180
with those that we come in contact with that we would be able to show to them a heart of

576
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:54,700
gratitude because of how great a God you are. I pray, Father, that you'd forgive us,

577
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:04,380
forgive me for murmuring and complaining, for discontent. Lord, help us to live with

578
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,820
this perspective. My cup runneth over. I pray that in the quietness of the moment this evening

579
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,820
that, Lord, we do business with you. I pray that you would use your word in our lives

580
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:24,980
to not only encourage us by these wonderful truths but, Lord, to convict us in times in

581
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:32,260
our lives where we've lacked gratitude to acknowledge tonight that sin, to confess it

582
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:38,460
and forsake it, but also to determine that by your grace and with your help we'll live

583
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,100
as a thankful people. I pray that you'd have your will and way in these moments of invitation

584
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,180
for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

585
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,740
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. Maybe the Lord spoke to your heart this evening.
