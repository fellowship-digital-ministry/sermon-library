00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
John, chapter number one, and get used to the book of First John will be here on Sunday

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.719
mornings throughout the year.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:13.640
And I have read the book of First John over the last 60 days, about 60 times, and not

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.639
just exclusively for my Bible reading, just in addition to my Bible reading to really

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:23.959
get the entirety of this book into my mind.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:27.040
And I trust to be a great blessing to you as we study through this book.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.120
As you know, each year I choose a theme for our church, an annual church theme, and I

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.520
seek direction from the Lord and ask to have guidance and wisdom with regard to the particular

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.880
theme for that year.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.659
And each year since I've been here, I've had a theme, and I've enjoyed the opportunity

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:50.360
to kind of keep on track with a theme, keep it before us, and keep a theme song, notes

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.240
of not only bookmarks, but sermon notebooks, calendars, just all of it, and just really

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.599
keep the theme before us.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.599
And it helps me.

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.840
I trust that it helps you as well.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.239
In 2012, the first full calendar year that I was here, we looked at a theme.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.400
I titled it Standing on His Promises.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.879
And of course, we find that there are wonderful promises in the Word of God.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.279
Peter described them as exceeding great and precious promises, and we went through a whole

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:22.959
host of promises from the Word of God, and we dealt with the fact that there are some

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.760
promises that are unconditional.

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:26.559
But I'm thankful for those promises.

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:28.739
And then there's some promises that are conditional.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:31.040
If you do this, then God says He'll do this.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.400
And those are great promises as well.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.959
And we looked at the conditional, unconditional promises.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.300
In 2013, I preached through the book of Esther.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.680
Our theme was For Such a Time as This, and I greatly enjoyed the book of Esther.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.160
In 2014, He Must Increase, and I preached through the book of John.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.760
And what a great declaration by John the Baptist.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.680
I must decrease, but He, He must increase.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.959
And it's all about Jesus.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.680
In 2015, Boldness to Speak Thy Word, and I preached through Acts 1-12, the first 12 chapters

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
of the book.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.360
And then the following year, in 2016, I preached the remainder of the book of Acts, and I preached

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.160
a theme, I Believe God.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.639
In Acts 27, Paul stood up with great confidence and said, I believe God, and how we need to

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.639
believe God.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:25.520
In 2017, I had our theme, Increase Our Faith, and how our faith needs to be increased.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.199
And the people of God are spoken of in various portions of Scripture.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.279
The church in Thessalonica, they were growing and exceeding.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.479
Their faith had increased, and how our faith is to be increased.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.759
And we dealt with a number of things throughout the year.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.360
Faith builders, I referred to them as, and how God will use His Word to increase our

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
faith.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.600
In 2018, count your blessings.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.199
And we have so many things to be thankful for.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.880
And our thought throughout the year was that by the end of the year, we'd have, I don't

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.119
preach every Sunday morning, we have missionaries and revival meetings, but we'd have 45 or

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.000
so reasons to rejoice.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.880
We started out by looking at it this way, if we learn to count our blessings, if we

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.960
learn to thank God for who He is, we will never lack reason to rejoice, for He never

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
changes.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.919
We're to thank Him for who He is, and then we're also to thank Him for what He does.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.119
And so often in our lives, we get so caught up in thanking God for what He does, and fail

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:29.800
to thank God for who He is, and we really focus upon who He is, we can go through some

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.960
real difficulties and trials, and know that He remains the same.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.279
He's still faithful and holy and just, and He's still all-powerful and all-knowing, and

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.839
we dealt with all sorts of things.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.600
In 2019, be strong in the Lord, the book of Ephesians, and we're to put on the whole armor

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600
of God.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.160
We are engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.080
I mentioned it in our Sunday school lesson this morning.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.559
So often people want to discuss in our media, in our world today, that we're engaged in

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:01.320
cultural wars, and the reality is that it goes far deeper than a cultural war, it is

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.199
a spiritual war.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.720
And the only way to engage in spiritual battle is to be strong in the Lord and the power

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.240
of His might to put on the whole armor of God.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.239
And then in 2020, how interesting this was, it was in October of 2019 that God laid upon

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.959
my heart for the year of 2020 to have as our theme, Looking Unto Jesus.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.940
I preached through the book of Hebrews, had no idea that this thing called coronavirus

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.920
was gonna come and cause all kinds of havoc, and I was so thankful for that theme because

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.559
how important it is that we lift up our eyes unto the hills from whence cometh our help,

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.640
knowing that our help cometh from the Lord.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.040
And Looking Unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, last year, complete in Christ,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.839
the book of Colossians, and I'm so thankful that I'm complete in Christ.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:57.959
And so many people are trying to find some kind of value in life and somebody's accommodations

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:03.359
and recommendations and all these sort of things, but knowing who we are in Christ and

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:08.119
knowing that we are complete in Him is just a great joy.

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:11.079
And then as we go through the book of 1 John, honestly, there's a couple of different themes

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:16.000
that you could look at in the book of 1 John, and as we go through the book, we will address

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.399
some of those, of course.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.119
And we have chosen from verse number 7 in 1 John 1 and verse number 7, notice the Bible

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:31.959
says this, but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:32.959
with another.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:38.839
In the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son cleanseth us from all sin.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.760
Lord willing and with the help of God, we'll study through this book of 1 John this year,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.959
and we will have as our theme, as is mentioned on the banners and all the things that you'll

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.359
get, walking in the light.

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:55.320
The message this morning will be more of a topical message dealing with the theme, and

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.720
then we will go through the book of 1 John beginning next week in the first verse of

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
the first chapter.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.519
We'll go through it exegetically through the entirety of the book of 1 John.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.839
But as we think about this theme of walking in the light, really, it could be synonymous

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:14.799
with really the thought of walking in obedience, in living a life of obedience.

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.679
We sing the song, trust and obey.

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:20.640
There's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.799
And the reality is that throughout the New Testament, there is much instruction that

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:28.480
is given to the people of God with regard to our walk.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.040
We have often said over the years that our walk matters to God.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.279
He cares how we live our lives.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.760
Our behavior matters to God.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.119
There are some that have taken the truth of 1 John, and they have twisted the truth of

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:42.119
1 John.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:48.480
Antinomianism is really an evil teaching that is very prevalent in our day and age in which

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.640
we're living, and they carry with it this idea that because you're saved, you can just

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.959
basically live however you want to live.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.760
Well, that's foreign to the truth of God's Word, because God is concerned about how we

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.399
live our lives.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:11.119
We've often said that belief impacts behavior, but the reality is that behavior reveals belief.

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:16.279
How we behave ourselves reveals what we believe, and we understand that the Word of God speaks

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.040
much to the walk of God's people.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.799
In fact, as we look at the book of Ephesians, and I will not have you turn there, but in

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:27.160
the book of Ephesians, on five different references in the last two chapters of the

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.239
book of Ephesians, Paul mentions specifically to the people of Ephesus truth with regard

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.239
to their walk.

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:38.440
We've mentioned, as we've studied through the book of Ephesians several years ago, as

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.079
we had as our theme, I mentioned already, in 2019, and we looked at that book, and we

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:48.359
understood that really the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians deal with our position

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:50.399
in Christ, who we are in Christ.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:51.399
We've been saved.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.959
We've been redeemed through the blood of Christ, and what a blessing that is.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:59.519
But the last part of the book becomes very practical, deals with our position, but then

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:06.320
the practical aspect of our now behavior, because of who we are in Christ, here's how

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.679
that should impact us.

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:14.559
Because I've been saved, I am to walk worthy of my calling, Ephesians 4 and verse number

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:15.559
1.

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:20.480
Because I have been saved, I am to walk not as other Gentiles, Ephesians 4 and verse

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.959
number 17.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:27.359
Because I have been saved, I am to walk in love, Ephesians 5 and verse number 2.

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:33.400
Because I have been saved, I am to walk as a child of light, Ephesians 5a.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.640
And finally, in Ephesians 5 and verse number 15, because I am a child of God, I am to walk

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.640
circumspectly.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.960
And as we think about those five aspects of our walk in the book of Ephesians, we understand

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.440
that Paul is not saying to the church at Ephesus, walk this way, do these things so that you

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.320
can be saved, or so that you can stay saved.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.760
No, he's already settled the matter of salvation in the first three chapters of the book of

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.200
Ephesians, and now he is saying, because you are saved, it should be evidenced by how you

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.159
live your life, your walk.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.140
Our walk matters to God.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.080
And as we study the book of 1 John, we will be challenged throughout the entirety of this

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.559
book to walk in the light as He is in the light.

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:26.520
And so this morning, as we look at this really introductory theme type of message, I want

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.400
you to notice, as we think about this truth of walking in the light, number one, if you're

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.859
taking notes, I would say this, walking in the light requires relationship.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:38.520
It requires relationship.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.479
It is not possible for you to walk in the light if you've not been saved.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.119
If you've not been born again, if you've not trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.719
you cannot walk in the light as He is in the light, as we find here.

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:56.520
Notice in verse number, let's just begin in verse number 1, that which was from the beginning,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.640
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.220
and our hands have handled of the word of life.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.600
For the life was manifested and we have seen it

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.480
and bear witness and show unto you

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.240
that eternal life which was with the Father

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.280
and was manifested unto us,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.660
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.280
that ye also may have fellowship with us.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.580
And truly our fellowship is with the Father

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.360
and with the Son, Jesus Christ.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.000
And these things write we unto you

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.200
that your joy may be full."

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.040
He's writing to believers,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.920
but one truth with regard to having our joy being full

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.040
is that we walk in the light.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.000
And that helps us to have that full joy.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.800
But he speaks here about redemption and about salvation.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.960
He says in verse number five,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.040
this then is the message which we have heard of him

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.920
and declare unto you that God is light

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.240
and in him is no darkness at all.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.320
Notice, if we say that we have fellowship with him

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.360
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.900
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.740
we have fellowship one with another.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.200
And the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.120
cleanseth us from all sin.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.120
You notice right in the middle of verse number two,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.500
it says that show unto you that eternal life.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.220
And I'm thankful as we mentioned even

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.960
as we studied a couple of weeks ago,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.340
the gift of God, if thou knewest the gift of God,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.320
the gift of God is eternal life.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.200
And if I'm going to walk in the light,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200
it requires relationship.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.420
This message of walking in the light

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.500
is not a message that is given to a lost person.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.120
It is given to someone that has been born again,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.840
that is saved, that is being challenged

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.600
to live that life of obedience.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.680
And it's only possible because of the relationship

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.760
that we have with Christ.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.560
We understand this morning that before salvation,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.940
we were at enmity with God.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.620
In Romans five and verse number eight,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.580
the word of God says,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.000
but God commendeth his love toward us.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.800
And that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.560
We were dead in our sins and our trespasses

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.000
according to Ephesians two.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.500
And we find that because of his great mercy,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000
because of his great love,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.400
we heard the gospel of Jesus Christ

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.460
and we were received the gift of God,

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.520
which is eternal life, believing that God loved me

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.560
and that Jesus died for me to pay for my sin,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.900
understanding that I could never pay for my own sin,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.180
that it's only through the blood of Jesus Christ,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.460
his death, his burial, and his glorious resurrection.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.780
And we place our faith and trust in Jesus Christ.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.600
Now, because I've been saved, I can walk in the light.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.160
I could not walk in the light before I got saved,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.260
and neither could you.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.700
And so this year, as we think about this theme,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.900
walking in the light, I would say that we must acknowledge

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.120
that walking in the light requires relationship.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.480
We cannot expect a lost person to live like a saved person.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.380
And we ought not, by the way.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.520
We ought not expect it.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.200
Sometimes we get so annoyed and so bothered

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.300
by various things that are taking place

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.140
and decisions that are being made

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.960
and legislation that is being passed,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.380
and we scratch our heads and it bothers us.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.960
And I understand the reasoning behind being bothered,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.240
but we understand this truth this morning

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.980
that many of those that are making those decisions

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.940
and passing the legislation, that they are in darkness,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.700
and they need the light of the glorious gospel

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.100
to shine in unto them.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.260
They cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.300
for the natural man receiveth not the things

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.780
of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.820
neither can he know them.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.740
This morning and this year, as we deal

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.220
with this subject matter of walking in the light,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.640
we understand this morning that because

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.000
we have been born again because of our relationship,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.840
it is possible that we can walk in the light.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.360
One of the songs that we sang this morning,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.680
the songwriter said,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.440
trying to walk in the light of the Savior.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.640
And the reality is that I can only,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.240
it's only possible because of the relationship.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.520
It's only possible because of the relationship.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.000
And what joy comes as a result of walking in the light.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.660
See, we were at enmity with God

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.220
and our sin prevented fellowship with God

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.740
and prevented us being able to walk with God,

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.580
and that's why we needed to be reconciled.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.660
And through redemption, through salvation,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.460
that act of reconciliation was made,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.180
and I'm so thankful that we can walk in the light.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.340
Let me say this, not only does walking in the light

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.780
require relationship,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.020
but walking in the light reveals obedience.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.840
Walking in the light reveals obedience.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.680
I mentioned already at the onset of the message,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.200
really in the introduction,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.440
that the phrase to walk in the light

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.120
can be really understood as being a walk of obedience.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.920
And when we think about walking in the light,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.180
revealing obedience, you know in verse number five,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.120
the Bible says this then is the message

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.920
which we have heard of Him and declare unto you.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.840
Notice what it says, that God is light

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.320
and in Him is no darkness at all.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.540
If we say, notice in verse number six,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.020
if we say that we have fellowship with Him,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.260
but yet we do what?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.260
We walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.640
But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.260
we have fellowship one with another,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.660
and so we see this revealing,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.220
this walking in the light reveals obedience.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.300
If you skip down to the second chapter of 1 John

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.600
in verse number three, the Bible says,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600
and hereby we do know that we know Him.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.440
How?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.180
If we keep His commandments.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.800
You'll see the word know multiple times

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.600
throughout the book of 1 John.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.740
And it says we know that we know Him

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.160
if we keep His commandments.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.480
He that saith, I know Him and keepeth not His commandments

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.920
is a liar and the truth is not in him.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.320
You say, man, that's kind of harsh.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.600
That's God's Word.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.580
Yes.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.780
God has given us in His Word some test, if you will,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.420
that we can examine and know if we're in the faith.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.260
Amen?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Some, what we'll refer to throughout 2022,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.060
of birthmarks of a believer.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.780
And here we find that He says this in verse number five,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.260
but whoso keepeth His Word,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.220
in him verily is the love of God perfected,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.280
hereby know we that we are in Him.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.240
He that saith, He abideth in Him.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.760
Notice what it says, ought Himself also so to walk

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.840
even as He walked.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.600
Is that how we get saved?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.440
No.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.440
Salvation's already settled.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.720
But because I'm saved as a child of God,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.560
I can have that now because of that relationship,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.960
I can walk in the light, but as I walk in the light,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.540
it reveals obedience.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.340
I want to walk in the light as He is in the light.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.460
I want to obey His Word, not so that I can be saved,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.580
not so that I can stay saved, but because I am saved,

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.960
I wanna live a life of obedience.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.140
We mentioned this morning in our Sunday school lesson

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.660
as we looked at that man, that man that was possessed

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.900
of a demon in Mark chapter number five,

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.620
and Matthew eight deals with it as well,

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.160
but in Mark chapter number five,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.460
we found that after his transformation,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.360
that he had a desire to be with Jesus.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.820
When the townspeople came, the folks from the city

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.220
heard what had happened, they sought Jesus,

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.380
and they found that man that was possessed of the devil

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.200
sitting clothed and in his right mind.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.020
And then when Jesus honored the request of the people

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.340
of the city to depart from their coast,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.540
we find the Bible says that that man

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.360
desired to be with Jesus.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.200
Why?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.740
Because of all that God did for him.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.460
And in our lives this morning,

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.860
as we think about this theme throughout the year,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.400
walking in the light, it first requires relationship,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.860
but then we find that as we're walking in the light,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.860
it reveals obedience, that heart of obedience.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.780
We understand that we're never gonna reach a place

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.900
of sinless perfection this side of heaven.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.500
There are some that have sought to teach that thought

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.600
and have spun that idea that we could reach

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.260
some level of sinless perfection,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.840
but in the very next verse, the Bible says

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.480
in 1 John 1 and verse number nine,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.440
excuse me, in two verses later,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.000
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.679
to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.280
from all unrighteousness.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.920
If we say that we have not sinned,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.239
we make him a liar and his word is not in us.

00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:54.000
If any man sin, according to verse number one of chapter two,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.799
we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.020
the righteous, and how thankful I am

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.260
that we have an advocate.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.619
And it's not the idea of walking in the light

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:05.980
is not the idea of reaching some level

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.980
of sinless perfection, rather, walking in the light

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.299
is simply walking in obedience to God

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.940
and saying, with my heart, I want to obey him.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.660
I want to take his word.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.440
I don't wanna argue with God.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.640
I don't wanna disagree with God.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.600
I'm gonna make a decision in my life

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.460
that I'm going to agree with God

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.600
and what God says, by his grace and with his help,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.960
I'm going to do.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.679
Live a life of obedience.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.200
Are there times in which we disobey?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.040
Sure.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.320
And that's when we confess and get it right.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.179
And then, once again, start walking in the light

00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:46.420
as he is in the light.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.239
It's a walk of obedience, and really,

00:19:49.239 --> 00:19:51.359
walking in the light reveals obedience.

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:53.580
Let me say this, number three,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.080
when we think about this theme of walking in the light,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.119
I would say walking in the light reveals progress.

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:00.439
reveals progress.

00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:01.839
You think about walking.

00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:03.319
Walking is not stationary.

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:04.439
Walking is moving.

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:06.399
And when you think about walking in the light,

00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:07.799
you think about making progress.

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:10.119
And obviously, last week on Sunday morning,

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:12.559
I preached a message from Exodus with regard

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:15.719
to really the thought of go forward

00:20:15.719 --> 00:20:19.639
and how the people of God, as they had left from Egypt

00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:21.599
and they were there right before the Red Sea

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:23.999
and they were noticing, they understood

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:26.279
that the Egyptians were seeking from behind them

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:28.219
and they're in this position.

00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:30.819
And God says to Moses, speak to the people

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:34.699
and tell them, go forward.

00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:37.339
And walking in the light reveals progress.

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.619
It's moving forward.

00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:40.059
It's not stationary.

00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:42.439
We're not holding on until Jesus comes.

00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:43.819
We're not running for the hills.

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:47.179
We're not living in fear and all of this sort of thing.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.179
No, we're to be on the offense.

00:20:49.179 --> 00:20:53.499
We're to be making progress as people of God.

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:55.299
When the Bible says of the church,

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:58.619
when Jesus gives this truth to Peter

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.899
in Matthew chapter number 16,

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:03.659
he says that I will build my church

00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:08.059
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.379
It's not that we're sitting back

00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:11.859
in some kind of defensive position

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:15.619
and trying to defend ourselves against the attack of Satan.

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:19.139
It's that the church, onward Christian soldiers,

00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:20.219
you know the song, right?

00:21:20.219 --> 00:21:21.739
Onward and forward.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.179
And we're moving forward.

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:26.859
And as we're moving forward for the Lord

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.339
and with the gospel,

00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:32.899
the gates of hell will not prevail against the church.

00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:35.819
That's his own promise.

00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:38.139
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:21:38.139 --> 00:21:40.619
Listen, when the great commission was given,

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:44.419
it was to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:46.019
In Acts chapter number one,

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:48.539
in Jerusalem, but Judea and Samaria

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:49.859
and unto the uttermost.

00:21:49.859 --> 00:21:52.719
And we understand that we are to be going

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:55.359
and we're to be making progress.

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:58.119
It's interesting to me that he says walk in the light.

00:21:58.119 --> 00:22:00.799
Sometimes you find some that have great zeal

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.119
and will speak of zeal even within this book

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:06.479
and understand some truth within the Word of God

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:07.399
of being zealous.

00:22:07.399 --> 00:22:09.720
And certainly there's reference to that

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.279
throughout the Word of God.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:13.399
But there are some that want to run

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:15.399
and they want to run, run, run

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:17.360
and then they kind of just fizzle out.

00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:21.679
You think about the consistency of the progress

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:24.000
that is made in walking.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.559
Walking in the light as he is in the light.

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:30.039
And it's making progress.

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:31.500
And we measure that progress.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.839
We want to see that progress.

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:34.559
We want to see some development.

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.039
And we think about our own lives

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.940
as we as individuals are walking in the light

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.239
as he is in the light.

00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:43.199
We see that progress in our Christian life.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.159
There is great joy to me as a pastor,

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.319
as a spiritual leader,

00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:52.440
when someone shares with me about reading their Bibles.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.039
When somebody shares with me,

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.319
as happened in 2021,

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:58.000
for the first time in my life,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.399
I read the entire Bible cover to cover.

00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:02.419
Man, that makes me rejoice.

00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:04.639
Because this Word is powerful.

00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:06.599
And we need to get it into our lives.

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:09.279
And we find that people when they say,

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:12.059
man, I got to share the Gospel with someone.

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:13.039
I got to see somebody.

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.559
I got to lead somebody to Christ.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.679
And it's the first person I ever led to Christ.

00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:18.839
And you begin to see that progress.

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:20.119
Why?

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:20.959
Because we're walking in the light

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:22.559
as he is in the light.

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.720
And we're making progress.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.839
And we're growing through obedience.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:29.000
And we find that that progress,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.779
listen, the Christian life is a life of growth.

00:23:33.159 --> 00:23:34.080
It's a life of growth.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.699
It's a life of progress.

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:40.199
He told us to occupy till he come.

00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:43.539
And we find that he told us to redeem the time.

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:46.519
Those are words that are given

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:48.720
that would describe that we're to be busy

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:51.319
about the work that God has given us.

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:53.399
We're to be making progress.

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:56.399
Walking, it reveals to me growth.

00:23:56.399 --> 00:23:58.559
It reveals to me maturing

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.459
when we think about this progress.

00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:03.039
And we think about that spiritual maturity

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:06.639
that is being revealed in this truth

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:08.379
of walking in the light.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.440
I hope this morning that you would say,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.160
I want to grow in my walk with God.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.000
I'm not content with where I am in my walk with God.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.160
I want to know Him.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.959
Think about the Apostle Paul.

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:28.079
For many of us, the Apostle Paul,

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:30.600
in our minds, if someone were to ask us

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.299
who's the greatest Christian,

00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:36.119
no doubt Paul would end up on your list.

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:38.699
He may not be the first one on everyone's list,

00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:41.760
but he would no doubt be on your list.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.380
And many times we hold Paul in high regard.

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:47.100
Because of how he was surrendered to God

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.500
and how God used him.

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:50.899
And we understand that God used him

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:52.779
because he was surrendered to God.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.260
Paul says of himself that he was the chief of sinners.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.739
He says in 2 Corinthians 12 that he does not want others

00:25:00.739 --> 00:25:04.100
to think more highly of him than they should.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.839
Paul was a man of humility.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.899
We hold him in high regard and we look at Paul

00:25:10.899 --> 00:25:14.720
as being a great Christian, and certainly he was.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.139
But in the book of Philippians, in the third chapter,

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:21.260
he says that I may know him

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.179
and the power of his resurrection

00:25:23.179 --> 00:25:25.019
and the fellowship of his sufferings

00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:28.579
being made conformable unto his death.

00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:30.940
You understand this morning that that was not written

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.019
in the first month or the first year of Paul's salvation,

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:35.579
of his walk with God.

00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:38.699
That's written near the end of Paul's life.

00:25:39.699 --> 00:25:43.459
And Paul's saying, I wanna know him.

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.779
You think about the psalmist.

00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:46.699
I've preached before from this thought

00:25:46.699 --> 00:25:49.220
of understanding the greatness of who God is

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.540
and declaring his greatness.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.739
The psalmist says, I know that the Lord is great

00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:56.500
and what great declarative truth that is.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.100
But then 10 psalms later, the Bible says

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.739
that the greatness of God is unsearchable.

00:26:03.739 --> 00:26:05.059
Is it contradictory?

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:05.899
No.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:09.380
I know God is great.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.779
I've known that for years, but each year I find out

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:13.779
that he's greater than I thought he was.

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:15.859
Right?

00:26:15.859 --> 00:26:19.339
No matter how great you think God is today,

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:21.739
as you walk in the light, as you grow,

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:24.660
as you make progress, as you mature spiritually,

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.919
you're gonna find out he's greater than I thought he was.

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:32.179
I mean, I dealt with this problem and I had this situation

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:35.979
and I just didn't know how, and God showed his greatness

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.220
that I may know him.

00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:41.820
So we can't be content.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.299
We can't get stagnant.

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:44.899
We can't flounder around.

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:46.500
We must walk in the light.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.959
We must be walking in obedience and making that progress.

00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:53.859
We sing the song, as I mentioned,

00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:56.220
we had as a theme, Standing on the Promises,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.299
and sometimes you'll hear someone say,

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:00.179
it's not sitting on the premises.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.100
Amen?

00:27:02.899 --> 00:27:05.059
Or not to just be sitting around idle.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:10.059
Get busy, get working, walk with God and serve God.

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:13.179
This evening, I'm gonna preach a message

00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:14.660
I've titled Living Your Faith.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.260
You see it on the back of the bulletin, Living Your Faith.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.660
I'm gonna challenge you this evening.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.479
I'm gonna actually pass out some cards this evening,

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:26.179
not that you would return them to me,

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:28.339
but that you would keep them in your own Bible,

00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:31.100
and I want you to make some commitments to God

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.660
of how you're gonna grow this year,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.779
and how you're going to develop this year,

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:37.059
and how with God's help.

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:37.899
Why?

00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:39.739
Because as it says on the card

00:27:39.739 --> 00:27:42.000
that I'll hand out this evening,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.739
if I fail to plan, I plan to fail.

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:49.899
If I aim for nothing, I hit it every time, right?

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.739
And so I'm gonna set some goals at this time of the year.

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.720
We find there are many that have these resolutions

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.260
and New Year's resolutions,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.260
and I'm gonna do this, and I'm gonna do that.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.380
The month of January, historically,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.179
has been the highest month for new gym memberships on record.

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:12.500
In fact, I got an email this morning from Planet Fitness.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.419
You can rejoin for zero dollars.

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:17.959
They know how it works.

00:28:17.959 --> 00:28:20.119
Everyone gets done after the holidays,

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:22.040
and Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and New Year's,

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.859
and the clothes don't fit like they did in October,

00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:28.260
and you say, man, I'm gonna go back to the gym.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.540
And they know it, and they market right to it,

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.659
and they take your money, and you don't go,

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:36.619
and they just enjoy it, right?

00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:37.659
And if you go to the gym,

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:39.039
if you're one of those gym people,

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:40.739
and you go to the gym all of the time,

00:28:40.739 --> 00:28:44.239
you notice that in August, and September, and October,

00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:45.859
man, the machines are available,

00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.859
and I can just go in and exercise and do what I have to do,

00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:50.919
and in January, there's all these new faces,

00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:52.380
and no machines are available,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.580
and they don't know what they're doing,

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.059
and everything's occupied.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.219
Just wait until March,

00:28:57.219 --> 00:29:00.940
and it will just kind of die back down, right?

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.339
But in the Christian life,

00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:07.299
this year, as we have this theme of walking in the light,

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:10.080
I want it to be before us every single week.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.919
Why?

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:12.659
Because we're gonna be making progress.

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:17.299
Today, am I closer to God than I was last week?

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.260
Am I closer to Him today than I was a year ago?

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.739
I hope we can say yes.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.339
If there was some time in your life

00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:31.659
that you were closer to God than what you are today,

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:33.219
that could simply be defined

00:29:33.219 --> 00:29:35.179
in a single word of being backslidden.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.940
We need to be close to God.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.659
In walking in the light, it requires relationship.

00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:47.580
I can't walk in the light if I'm not saved.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.299
It reveals obedience, because it's walking in obedience.

00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:52.559
It reveals progress,

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.260
and let me say this finally this morning, number four.

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:59.260
Walking in the light results in fellowship.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.200
It results in fellowship.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.840
Notice back in verse number 3, it says, "'That which we have seen and heard declare unto

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.560
you that you also may have fellowship with us.'"

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.720
Notice the rest of the verse, "'And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.760
His Son Jesus Christ.'"

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.240
It's absolutely amazing that the God of the universe would desire to have fellowship with

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.800
us, isn't it?

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.920
It's absolutely amazing that the God of the universe would desire to have fellowship with

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.640
us, but He does.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.240
Draw nigh to God, He'll draw nigh unto you.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.280
It is good for me, the psalmist says, to draw nigh unto the Lord.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.220
He desires to have fellowship with us.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.620
We know in verse number 5, it says, "'This then is the message which we have heard of

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.320
Him and declared unto you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.520
For if we walk in the light, as He is in the light," and so we find that really, and

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.800
we think about walking in the light results in fellowship, I would say first, and by looking

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:05.360
at verse number 3, no doubt that our fellowship is with the Lord.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.680
And how sweet that is.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.220
The psalmist said, "'In thy presence is fullness of joy.'"

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.760
In Psalm 16 and verse number 11, "'In thy presence is fullness of joy.'"

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.080
Verse 3 says in verse number 4, "'And these things write we unto you, that your joy may

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.900
be full.'"

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:32.520
I said this on Friday evening during our watch night service, if you will, that some of the

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:43.640
most joyful, glad, happy people on the face of the planet should be God's people.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.000
Amen?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.080
Jesus gave us joy, unspeakable, amen?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.120
And full of glory.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.440
And we understand, remember the disciples, they came back, and Luke records that they

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.720
came back rejoicing because the spirits were made subject unto them, and Jesus said, "'In

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.720
this, rejoice not.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720
Rather, rejoice,' why?

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.920
"'That your names are written in heaven.'"

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.040
Do you know the Bible says, "'No man taketh your joy.'"

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.200
David prayed, "'Lord, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.'"

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.800
Why was his joy stolen?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.560
Because of his sin.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.240
Sin will rob you of your joy.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.360
But in His presence, as I'm walking in the light, it results in fellowship, first fellowship

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:34.440
with Him, and how sweet it is, and how joyful, and how we ought to be glad when we meditate

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.560
upon who He is.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:41.120
That's what we looked at on Friday evening, Psalm 103, and just our meditation of Him

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.080
is sweet, and we are glad, and what joy that is.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.160
Listen, we ought to be joyful people.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.920
As a preacher, I think it's, Palmer Sean said this before, that far too often he goes into

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.840
churches and he meets Christians that look like they've been sucking on lemon juice through

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.160
a fire hose.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.040
It's a great analogy.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.960
I mean, just a picture comes in your mind immediately when you hear that phrase, and

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.960
I'm like, man, that's pretty good, I like that.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.480
We ought not be that way.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:17.220
We ought not be the Eeyore, oh, bother, right, everything's just so bad.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.220
How are you?

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.220
Well, under the circumstances.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.280
You ever hear somebody say that?

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.520
When did you ever read in your Bible you're supposed to live under the circumstances?

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.760
Amen?

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.400
He's in control of the circumstances, is He not?

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400
He's allowed it.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.520
He's the sovereign God of the universe, and He has a purpose in it.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.820
He has a plan for it, and we understand that.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.080
We can rejoice.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.280
You think about the truth of 1 Peter.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.600
If need be, you're in these manifold temptations, the trial of your faith, but what are you

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600
to do?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600
Rejoice.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
Rejoice.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.680
It results in fellowship.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:06.240
But really specifically mentioned in our text of verse number 7 is not fellowship with God.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.940
It's really interesting.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.820
Look back at verse number 7 with me.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.940
Yes, indeed, as we walk in the light, we have fellowship with God.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.220
But in verse number 7, I want you to notice what is said.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:28.619
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:33.180
And the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin.

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.860
So He's specifically mentioned with regard to walking in the light in this verse with

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.420
regard to fellowship is fellowship one with another.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.700
I believe that this is quite insightful.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.220
As each believer, as each individual believer walks in the light, as He is in the light,

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:56.460
yes, we have fellowship with God, but then we have fellowship one with another.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.940
So if you're walking in the light, you're walking in the light, you're walking in the

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.660
light, and I'm walking in the light, we're all walking in the light, then guess what?

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.820
Yes, we have fellowship with God, but then we have fellowship one with another.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.700
And by the way, in the Christian life, we're to have fellowship one with another.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.740
We need fellowship one with another.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.740
The reality is that there is to be no division within the body.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.900
There's to be no schism.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:29.260
There's to be no problems as we look at in the book of 1 Corinthians, and you look at

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.100
all of the division and the infighting and the schisms and all that's taking place in

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.220
the church in Corinth, that's not to be.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.140
We're to strive for unity.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.180
And as we understand the passage of Scripture that is before us with the theme for this

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:49.660
year in verse number 7, yes, we understand the fellowship that we have with God and how

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.339
blessed that is and how grateful we are for it, but the reality is that He specifically

00:35:55.339 --> 00:36:02.820
mentions that we have fellowship one with another, the unity that we have.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.220
Can I say this?

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:13.580
When a church lacks unity, when believers, when Christians are at odds one with another,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:26.940
when they're divided, one or both are not walking in the light as He is in the light.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:33.420
Because as we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.940
We strive for that unity.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:42.860
I've often said this over the years, listen, there's an idea, a thought that's very prevalent

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.980
in our society today with regard to unity that we just set aside those things that divide

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:53.300
us and embrace those few things that would help us to have unity, but that's not unity.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.220
You're never going to have unity by doing that, why?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.540
Because those things that divide you are still there.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:06.380
The only way to have unity is when each of us as individuals agree to agree with God.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:11.740
That's the only way to have unity, because you have a different background than I do,

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.100
you have a different perspective than I do, you just keep listing it out of all the differences

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.059
between us as individuals.

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:24.779
But if we want to have unity and we want to have fellowship one with another, we have

00:37:24.779 --> 00:37:28.300
to say, what does God say?

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:35.180
And you and each one of you and me and each believer, we say, I'm going to agree with

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.140
God.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.059
And as I agree with God and I make His Word the authority, by the way, as Baptist people

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:49.580
we often say, as we look at the Baptist distinctives, that God's Word is the sole authority for

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.580
faith and practice.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.140
What does that mean?

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.339
It's the only one, right?

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:58.420
It's not my opinion, it's not your opinion, it's not what the church fathers said, it's

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.920
what God says.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.119
So if I say I'm going to agree with God, and if Ron says he's going to agree with God,

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:11.559
and if you go right through the list, I'm not going to name everybody, says I'm going

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.360
to agree with God, then guess what?

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.760
We're going to agree with each other, right?

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.800
Because God's Word is the standard and it is the authority.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.279
And so as I'm walking in the light, to walk in the light, remember it reveals obedience,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.200
yes, the progress, but as I'm walking in the light, and I'm having that fellowship with

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.600
God, it also means that I have fellowship one with another.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.880
You ever think about going on a walk with someone?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.799
Maybe you're going to walk with your spouse, and you're making progress, you're taking

00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:51.600
a walk and physically speaking, and you have communion one with another, you have fellowship

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.239
one with another.

00:38:55.239 --> 00:39:00.919
As we walk with God, we have fellowship with God, but as collectively, so as individuals

00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:05.440
we have fellowship with God, but then collectively or corporately when we're all walking in the

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.960
light, we then have fellowship not only with God, but then one with another.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:19.080
And it's sweet, and what joy to have that fellowship one with another.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.600
As we have the opportunity to iron sharpeneth iron, to encourage one another, to edify one

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.200
another, you know, the New Testament is full of one another commandments, and those one

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:40.400
another commandments are very impossible when you're not with one another, right?

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.559
Very very challenging and very difficult when you're not with one another.

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:49.320
And so as we're walking in the light as He is in the light, and yes, we have that fellowship

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.640
with Him I think about the result being fellowship one with another, the unity.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.320
And so this year, in 2022, we'll study through the book of first

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:06.360
John, I believe that, man, we'll be encouraged through the truth of 1 John.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.400
God wants us to know some things.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.080
He wants us to be settled on some things.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.040
He doesn't want us to be tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.960
He wants us to be settled, to know, and the word is used over and over and over.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960
He wants us to know.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.120
You know what He wants us to know the most?

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.520
He wants us to know that we belong to Him.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:35.600
1 John 5.13 is probably one of the most commonly memorized verses of all of 1 John.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.800
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.560
ye may know that ye have eternal life.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.980
And I think about that, having that knowledge of knowing that you have eternal life.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.440
He wants us to know that we belong to Him.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.080
And as we study through the book of 1 John, He wants us to know some things.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.600
There's a lot of things He wants us to know.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.960
He wants us to walk in the light.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.240
He wants us to have fellowship one with another.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:08.520
Listen, the church is God's plan and God's idea.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:15.320
The church is not the idea of Constantine or some other person.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.700
The church is the idea of God.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.480
God ordained the church.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:29.640
And God says, as individual believers make up this body of believers, He says, as individuals

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.160
you walk in the light.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.680
And as you walk in the light, you'll have fellowship one with another.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.840
It's a great byproduct.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.640
It's a great result of walking in the light, fellowship, first with God, next, it's specifically

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.300
mentioned in the text, with one another.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.000
This year, let's make a commitment, I'm going to walk in the light.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.080
Walking in the light.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.280
Father, we love You.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.200
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.200
We thank You for the Word of God and for the truth that's contained therein.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:14.840
God, I pray that as we enter into a new year, we have set before us this new theme, walking

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.440
in the light.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.760
We understand that it requires relationship.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.600
It's impossible for a lost person to walk in the light as He is in the light.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.440
God, if there's one here or one under the sound of my voice, maybe tuned in via live

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:37.480
stream that's not sure of heaven, they've never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480
personal Savior.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.080
I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:50.960
They would get it settled once and for all, so that they can begin walking in the light.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:57.840
For each one that's been born again, we know You as our personal Lord and Savior.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.860
I pray, God, that You'd help us to walk in the light, knowing that it reveals obedience

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.760
and it reveals progress.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:19.600
God, help us to really have a longing for You, a desire to know You, that, God, we would

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:25.000
not be content with where we are in our walk with You.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.040
We want to know You in a greater way.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.160
Help us to walk in obedience.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.680
Help us to have spiritual maturity in our lives.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:43.360
Help us to enjoy fellowship, yes, with You, but also with one another.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:50.420
I pray that You'd work in our hearts and lives, even through this introductory kind of a message.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:55.400
Help us to resolve, even as Matt prayed this morning for the offering, that we'd resolve

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.600
to draw closer to You, to know You.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.200
Help us, God, to walk in the light.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.320
Well, thank You for each decision that is made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.320
Would You stand with me?

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.220
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.679
As is our custom, we'll have an opportunity for an invitation, a response to the teaching

00:44:17.679 --> 00:44:19.080
and preaching of the Word of God.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.160
And if the Spirit of God has spoken to your heart this morning, I want to give you an

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.520
opportunity to respond.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.640
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.040
The altar is open.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.440
You make your pew and altar.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.679
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
