1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
number one and we of course have been studying through the book of Genesis in

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,800
fact we this is our 51st lesson through the book of Genesis and we have

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,719
effective successfully completed 19 chapters of study in 50 lessons and so

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:24,000
we're right on track to finish in three years or so but in any case this lesson

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
that I'm going to teach this evening that I have titled what about dinosaurs

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,400
was a lesson that I was going to teach way back in March of 2020 and I guess

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,000
last week of March first week of April somewhere in that time frame is what my

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,520
plan was to teach it and of course kovat came and service schedules got all kinds

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,200
of weird and I was preaching to a camera only and for several weeks and what have

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,639
you just had a handful of people here and so I ended up just continuing to go

11
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,880
through the book of Genesis and never really had an easy stopping point with

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,400
regard to the just the dialogue that's going through the book of Genesis and

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,919
when I finished the 19th chapter I felt that it was a good break point to be

14
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:10,480
able to of course some things with Abraham continue but it was a good

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,680
break point for us to be able to have this lesson this evening and so many of

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,440
the children were coming up to me saying is it true pastor are you teaching about

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,480
dinosaurs tonight and they were all excited and one little boy I won't tell

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,519
you who was so excited that he almost couldn't ask me the question and the

19
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,559
father kept saying go ahead ask him ask him ask him and finally enough courage

20
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:40,080
to say is it true that you're gonna teach on dinosaurs and then asked why

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,919
and of course the the truth of God's Word is important that we'd understand

22
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:51,480
even the subject matter of dinosaurs in fact I believe this evening that there

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,680
are times in our lives that we may shy away or maybe even avoid a conversation

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,400
with someone about dinosaurs because we just simply don't know how to deal with

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,000
it we don't know how to answer the questions we don't feel like we have

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,759
been adequately trained we can't debate their science and so on and so forth and

27
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:18,080
so we may shy away or even avoid altogether some conversations with

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
people about a subject matter like dinosaurs because we just don't know and

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,160
this evening I want to right up front admit to you that I am NOT a

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,759
paleontologist I do not study dinosaurs I don't study fossils and I did a lot of

31
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,199
study for this particular message and I hope it'll be a blessing to you but we

32
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,679
understand that there are many paleontologists that do lots of work and

33
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:47,919
there have been volumes scores of books that have been written upon dinosaurs

34
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,199
and we understand there are many documentaries that you can watch and

35
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,160
listen to and people that have all sorts of credentials and what-have-you in fact

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,240
it's exciting that there are plenty of good resources that are available of

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,000
those that have been adequately appropriately trained to be able to

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,479
discuss the subject matter in great detail that are coming from it from a

39
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,080
biblical worldview a biblical perspective you don't always find that

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,199
of course and so I would encourage you that as of course children are super

41
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,160
excited and interested in dinosaurs but as you begin to maybe through this study

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,000
have some interest in learning some additional things there are some good

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,360
resources out there I will say this there are two organizations one of them

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,479
is answers in Genesis I do not give a broad statement of support to any

45
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,600
organization but I will tell you that they have some good materials on

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,880
creation they have some good materials on dinosaurs and what-have-you and then

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,880
the Institute of Creation Research again I'm not giving a broad you know

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,039
statement with support fully of either of these organizations but I do say that

49
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,679
they are organizations are out there that have lots of good material that

50
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:06,479
comes from a biblical perspective a biblical worldview I believe that as we

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,000
begin to study and think about this that it would be important that we understand

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,440
of course as a pastor that I'm going to be approaching this with a biblical

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,279
worldview and having a biblical worldview and starting with and ending

54
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,359
with the Bible will lead us to a place where we will have different conclusions

55
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:29,959
and different understandings than those who doubt or just straight-up oppose the

56
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,119
Word of God and so we have to understand that one of the lessons that I

57
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:39,640
previously taught we dealt with the flood and I dealt with the Grand Canyon

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,399
in a particular message and looked at a number of things of how the waters

59
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,679
assuaged and how that could be formed very easily and quickly we also looked

60
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,200
at a subject matter and spent an entire lesson dealing with the Ice Age and

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,920
dealing with those things and one thing that I said repeatedly in those two

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,679
messages I'll say it again this evening the problem is not with what we see but

63
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:04,679
it's with how we interpret what we see listen there are plenty of fossils out

64
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:09,760
there that show us that dinosaurs existed and the problem is not with what

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,440
we see but it's in how we interpret that which we see and we find that it's

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,320
important that we begin with the Bible what does the Word of God say these

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,940
things that we see when we talk about maybe the the Grand Canyon we speak

68
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,959
about the Ice Age we talk about dinosaurs these things do not take

69
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,320
millions or even billions of years I I believe that they simply require the

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,739
right conditions and we dealt with that we talked about the the Grand Canyon we

71
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,160
dealt with that we talked about the Ice Age and some of those conditions and I

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,000
think that that's also pertinent here to our discussion this evening I have you

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,119
there in the book of Genesis I want to read one verse to you from the New

74
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:54,299
Testament in 1st Thessalonians 5 and then we'll get right back to Genesis

75
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:58,779
chapter 1 but in 1st Thessalonians 5 in verse number 21 the Bible says this

76
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:06,739
prove all things hold fast that which is good and let me just give you let me

77
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,380
look at read a couple of verses of Scripture and then give you some common

78
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,779
teaching with regard to dinosaurs and then give some biblical answers in

79
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:20,420
Genesis 1 in verse number 24 the Bible says this and God said let the earth

80
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:27,540
bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and

81
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:35,100
beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the beast of the

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,260
earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth

83
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,980
upon the earth after his kind and God saw that it was good we'll look at some

84
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,100
more verses here as we get through the lesson this evening but we find that

85
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,579
here these verses in verse 24 and 25 are the first verses dealing with that which

86
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:02,059
was created on day six of creation and we find that God is giving us

87
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:06,019
information throughout the record of Genesis chapter 1 with regard to

88
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,940
creation and one phrase that you'll find repeated we read it multiple times just

89
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,739
in those two verses is this word kind after his kind after their kind and it's

90
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,739
important that we understand that we dealt with that many many months ago

91
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,739
actually a year and a half ago as we studied Genesis 1 in more detail in each

92
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:29,820
day of creation with regard to dinosaurs specifically and answering the question

93
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,899
what about dinosaurs let me just give you a few things that people will say

94
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,100
common teaching common thoughts with regard to dinosaurs number one they'll

95
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,500
say this dinosaurs reigned for a hundred and sixty five million years after

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,700
evolving from some other type of reptile now rate at face value do you have any

97
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,100
problems with that statement I got a couple of problems right away the

98
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,140
timeline 165 million years I got a problem with the timeline and I got a

99
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:01,660
problem with the fact that they evolve from other reptiles and we'll deal with

100
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,700
that we'll discuss that approximately 65 million years ago so for a hundred and

101
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,220
sixty five million years these dinosaurs reigned upon the earth and then 65

102
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,100
million years ago there was some major event they would believe it was some

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,899
kind of an asteroid that struck earth and killed off the dinosaurs I got a

104
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,820
problem with that as well I got a problem with the timeline again and I

105
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,420
have a problem with the answer as to what happened but here's the the the

106
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,859
reality remember the problem is not with what we see but how we interpret what we

107
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,500
say right so nobody was around a hundred sixty five million years ago no one's

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,299
around 65 million years ago and they're looking at these fossils and they're

109
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,419
coming from a perspective of no biblical worldview and they're saying where did

110
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:49,659
this stuff come from how did it get here and they just begin to come up with some

111
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,419
kind of answers and they give some kind of scientific reason and logic and so on

112
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:59,059
and so forth and we find that they would dismiss Bible truth another common

113
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:04,340
teaching would be this that humans and dinosaurs did not live at the same time

114
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,299
they would say that there was nearly 65 million years that passed before humans

115
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:15,500
appeared on earth well I got a problem with that as well as you look at the

116
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,780
account of Genesis and the verses that I just read in verses 24 and 25 of the

117
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,140
creation of day six you know what happens right after that event is God

118
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,580
creates man on the same day day number six and so I have problems with that and

119
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,059
here's one of the things that they often say that I believe can cause us to have

120
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,260
great difficulty in engaging in conversations with individuals and it's

121
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,739
this that the word dinosaur doesn't even appear in the Bible right so they'll say

122
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,619
something to the effect of the word dinosaur doesn't appear in the Bible and

123
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,419
so the Bible doesn't say anything about dinosaurs there's nothing in there about

124
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,940
it and so how are you going to talk to me about dinosaurs right they'll say

125
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,059
something like that well here's what's interesting about the word

126
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:07,059
dinosaur. The word dinosaur was first used by Sir Richard Owen in 1841. All

127
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,799
right, that's a hundred and forty years ago. It was the first time the word

128
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,099
dinosaur was ever used. It was used by this man, Sir Richard Owen, as he was

129
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:20,579
addressing the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The term was

130
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:27,539
then published in 1842. So if the term was first used in 1841 and we find that

131
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,819
it was then used, I said, I think I said 140, it'd be 180 years ago, and it was

132
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:37,859
then published in 1842, we would not expect the word dinosaur to be in our

133
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:44,139
Bible, right? We understand that the word, if there's a word, you know, they have

134
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:49,339
in the English language, the dictionary, they have new words that they add into

135
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:52,659
the dictionary all the time. And each year they have a certain number of words

136
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,259
that they add into the dictionary. Well, it would be foolish of us to say that

137
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,459
there was a word entered into the dictionary in 2020 and we'd have an

138
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,259
issue with the fact that that word was nowhere to be found in any legal

139
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,959
documents or otherwise in 1984. Well, of course it wasn't in those documents in

140
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,860
1984 because those documents were written before that word was ever

141
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,860
injected into the English language. And so we understand that the Bible was

142
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,899
originally the the Old Testament, Hebrew and Aramaic. We understand the New

143
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,579
Testament to be Greek, and we find that this Bible, of course, you think about

144
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,659
the Word of God and the existence of the Word of God and how God gave His Word,

145
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,299
and in 1841 some guy comes along and uses the word dinosaur, and there are

146
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,339
people that will say to you as a Bible-believing Christian that you can't

147
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,500
have, you have no authority to talk about dinosaurs because the word doesn't exist

148
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
in the Bible, and so God doesn't know anything about it. That's just foolish.

149
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,939
But the reality is that sometimes it will stop us dead in our tracks because

150
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:54,939
you cannot find the word dinosaur in the Bible. I don't care what kind of

151
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:58,860
concordance you have, it's not there, but it does not

152
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,860
mean that God's Word doesn't deal with the subject matter of dinosaurs. And so

153
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,059
let me answer just a few questions if I can. The first question I would ask by

154
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,779
way of kind of teaching through this this evening would be this, where did

155
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,259
dinosaurs come from? Of course, I'm sure you already know what my answer is, but

156
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,779
let's look at what the Word of God says. Where did dinosaurs come from? Of course,

157
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,339
we mentioned that they said that they reigned upon the earth for about 165

158
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,739
million years after evolving from reptiles, some other kind of reptile. We

159
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:31,380
reject evolution, and therefore we would conclude that they had to have been

160
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,339
created by God. The Word of God clearly states in multiple places, remember I

161
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,899
mentioned to you that the the subject of creation is not isolated to Genesis 1.

162
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,419
The subject of creation is found all throughout the Word of God, and we find

163
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:50,220
that there are many references throughout the whole of the Bible that

164
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,179
speaks of God being the creator of all things. And we find that God is the

165
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,779
creator of all things, and we understand that as you read the record of Genesis

166
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,099
chapter number 1, and we dealt with this in great detail, that this is a

167
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:10,660
literal 24-hour day, a six-day creation. We find that God mentions to the

168
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,339
children of Israel that in six days God made all things, and he repeats this

169
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,779
throughout the Word of God. And the reference that I read in verses 24 and

170
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,020
25, that is the event of the creation on day number six, and you find that in verse

171
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,940
number 25 that the Word of God says, and God made the beast of the

172
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,860
earth after his kind. And so we find their cattle after their kind, everything

173
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,099
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and God saw that was good. And we

174
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,699
focus upon that statement, it says God made the beast of the earth after his

175
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:45,179
kind. Admittedly, the Word is not dinosaur. Again, to reference what I said a moment

176
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,339
ago, the Word did not exist, and therefore we would not expect to find

177
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:53,020
that Word in the Word of God. But we remember, and we're mindful of the fact

178
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,699
that God's Word clearly teaches that God made all things in six days, and that

179
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,259
would include dinosaurs. Now, there are some that would have the idea that

180
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,619
perhaps it was on day five and day six, maybe there was some on day five, some on

181
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:09,739
day six, there is certainly some that could have an argument with that

182
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,779
On day number five, you'll see that it begins in verse number 20, and God

183
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,500
said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath

184
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,059
life, and fowl that they may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

185
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,540
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the

186
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,779
waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after

187
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,940
his kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful

188
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,459
and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

189
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,859
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. If you study all of the

190
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:42,859
dinosaurs, and I'm not going to get into it this evening, there are way too many of

191
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,820
them, and all this, I can't say all the words anyway, some of these little boys

192
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,299
can probably say some of the words better than I can, but the reality is

193
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:54,059
that there were some that were land creatures, some that were that were

194
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,220
flying creatures, and some that were in the the water, marine creatures, if you

195
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,260
will. And so no doubt some of them could have been created there on day number

196
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,139
five. It is of interest and of note that many people would argue, those that would

197
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,700
adopt the evolutionary perspective of not only where did dinosaurs come from,

198
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,059
but where did they end up, that they would speak about them becoming or

199
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:19,299
evolving into birds. But birds were created on day number five, as we see

200
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:25,019
clearly indicated here, and we find that to be the case in the Word of God. Now,

201
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,899
when we think about God creating these dinosaurs on day number six, as we look

202
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,739
at verses 24 and 25, we will remember to answer the question where they say that

203
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:40,660
man and dinosaur did not dwell on the earth at the same time. Remember they

204
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,220
mentioned that there's 65 million years after the extinction, if you will, of

205
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,179
dinosaurs, that man came upon the earth. Well, the Bible continues in verse number

206
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:56,739
26 of Genesis 1, and says, and God said, let us make man in our image after our

207
00:15:56,739 --> 00:16:00,419
likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of

208
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,179
the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing

209
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:08,899
that creepeth upon the earth. Verse 27, so God created man in his own image, and

210
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:14,500
the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. God blessed them,

211
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,779
and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth, and subdue

212
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,739
it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and

213
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:27,940
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth, including dinosaurs. All right,

214
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,179
that's what God says. He doesn't say including dinosaurs, I'm saying

215
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:35,459
that's what he's saying, because he says every living thing that

216
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,059
moveth upon the earth, that would be inclusive of dinosaurs, and therefore we

217
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:46,299
would confidently conclude that humans and dinosaurs absolutely lived at the

218
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:52,299
same time, 100%. And we find, turn over to the book of Job, if you will, Job chapter

219
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:57,540
number 40. Turn to the book of Job, and I'm not gonna get into all of this this

220
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:01,419
evening, we won't be able to take the time to do so. I'm just gonna look at

221
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,139
chapter number 40, but you can look at chapter number 41 and read about Leviathan.

222
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:08,859
We're gonna look at chapter number 40 and read about a behemoth, and

223
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,820
we think about behemoth, it begins here in Job chapter number 40, and I want you

224
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:21,859
to begin looking with me at verse number 15. Job 40 and verse number 15. Notice

225
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:26,119
what God is saying here. This is God's second speech, speaking of his power, the

226
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,359
Lord answered Job, if you look at verse number six, it said, then answered the

227
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,880
Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind and said, and so just so we can pick up

228
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,239
context, I'm gonna begin in verse 15, but just so you understand, this is the Lord

229
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:42,480
speaking to Job. Behold now, behemoth, which I have made with thee, he eateth

230
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,600
grass as an ox. Now notice the phrase, God says, which I made with thee, right? So

231
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,000
this behemoth that he's speaking of, God says, I made him, and then he says, he

232
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:03,200
eateth grass as an ox. Lo, now, verse number 16, his strength is in his loins and his

233
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,200
force is in the navel of his belly. Verse 17, he moveth his tail like a cedar. The

234
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,720
sinews of his stones are wrapped together. His bones are as strong pieces

235
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,679
of brass. His bones are like bars of iron. Notice verse 19, he is the chief of the

236
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:29,720
ways of God. He that made him, who's that? That's God. He that made him can make his

237
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,960
sword to approach unto him. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all

238
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,520
the beasts of the field play. He lieth under the shady trees and the covert of

239
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,559
the reed and fens. The shady trees cover him with their shadow. The willows of the

240
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,840
brook compass him about. Behold, he drinketh up a river and hasteth not. He

241
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,559
trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. And so we begin to see, verse

242
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,320
number 24, says he taketh it with his eyes, his nose pierceth through with

243
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,559
piercing, pierceth through snares. And so we begin to look at these phraseologies and

244
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,200
all that's done and how it's explained to us. There are some, in fact, it might be

245
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,400
that you have a study Bible in your hand this evening that will say that behemoth

246
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,359
was like a hippopotamus, or that behemoth was like an elephant. Well, the

247
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,960
description that I just read to you does not line up with, I know what a

248
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,359
hippopotamus is, amen? I know what an elephant is. Neither one of them have a

249
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,039
tail like a cedar, right? I mean, they just don't fit the description. And so

250
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,880
therefore, for us to take this approach, and unfortunately Bible, study

251
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,359
Bibles and some Bible scholars of yesteryear, they would just take this

252
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,679
approach of saying, well, it must be a hippopotamus, it must be a whatever,

253
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,719
because they don't know how to answer the question. And then you have more problems

254
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:52,559
interacting with somebody because, well, the word dinosaur isn't there and they

255
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,279
say that it's a hippopotamus. It just doesn't line up. The description that God

256
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,159
gives here at the end of Job chapter number 40, this

257
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:10,199
This is not a hippo, this is not some kind of a large mammal, animal, elephant or otherwise.

258
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:14,959
We find that the description is given of a huge animal with a long neck that ate grass.

259
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:20,319
I believe that it would describe a sauropod if you would, perhaps even, and you guys bear

260
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,999
with me, some of these little kids can say the words better than I can, a brachiosaurus.

261
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,959
And when you think about this particular, and I didn't take pictures and bring it up

262
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:34,519
here or anything, but you think about this particular dinosaur and you think about the

263
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,759
description of this dinosaur and you think about the way in which this description here

264
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,759
in Job 40 and the fossils that have been found, it matches greatly.

265
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,119
It's a great answer to, okay, it must have been behemoth, must have been a sauropod,

266
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,399
and specifically a brachiosaurus.

267
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,439
And so we think about the pre-flood climate, remember we dealt with the flood and we talked

268
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:01,879
about that pre-flood climate and how things, you think about the longevity of life, the

269
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:06,719
longevity of all of those things, the way the climate was and so on and so forth, and

270
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:11,839
you begin to find out how these creatures could thrive in such an environment.

271
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,879
It's interesting because this here text tells us in verse number 15 about behemoth that

272
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,479
he eateth grass as an ox.

273
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,999
Well, that was always a problem for folks when they began to, especially with these

274
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:31,279
evolutionary scientists that would give their answers as to what they would believe with

275
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,679
regard to dinosaurs and their aging and so on and so forth.

276
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,079
But there was some, and I apologize if it's crude, but there was some fossilized dinosaur

277
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:46,159
dung that was found in the rocks of India.

278
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,959
And this fossilized dinosaur dung that was found in the rocks of India showed very plainly

279
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:55,439
that sauropods ate grass.

280
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:00,479
Well that kind of caused a problem for them, because they didn't believe that grass existed

281
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:07,399
at the same time that these dinosaurs existed, because on their evolutionary timeline it

282
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,599
didn't line up that way.

283
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,839
So when you look at all the millions of years and all the things that go on, it's okay,

284
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,039
we need to go back to the drawing board and figure this out.

285
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,999
From a Bible perspective, I have no problem with behemoth eating grass.

286
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:19,999
Why?

287
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:23,759
Because on day number three is when God created grass.

288
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,479
If you go back to Genesis chapter number one and you look at verse number 11, the Bible

289
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,959
says, and God said, let the earth bring forth grass.

290
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:31,959
And guess what?

291
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:35,839
In verse number 12, the earth brought forth grass.

292
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,999
As we've mentioned as we've studied through Genesis chapter number one, again, it's been

293
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,959
a long time ago when we're studying through it specifically, but we mentioned how God

294
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,039
everything he does is in order, right?

295
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,879
There's decency and order with God, and we find that God, as he would create, he would

296
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:55,559
provide the provision for the next thing that he would create.

297
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,999
These things needed to have some kind of food source, and so God created the food source

298
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,879
and then created the creature.

299
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,799
And so it's no problem for us as a biblical creationist to say, well, there's a fossil

300
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,759
that is of a dinosaur and he has grass.

301
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,759
Well, sure.

302
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:13,599
In fact, it wasn't until after the flood that they ate meat.

303
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,679
They all ate grass.

304
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:15,679
But here's what happens.

305
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,199
Remember my statement in the very beginning.

306
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:22,519
It's not so much with what we see, but how we interpret what we see.

307
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,639
Sometimes they see these dinosaurs and they got these big, huge teeth, and I mean, they're

308
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:29,479
sharp and all this stuff, and they just, man, they have to be these ferocious meat eaters

309
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:32,399
and so on and so forth.

310
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:34,399
How do you reach the conclusion?

311
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:37,039
Behemoth ate grass as an ox.

312
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,239
It's what God tells us.

313
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:44,439
And so as we begin to understand and ask the question, where did dinosaurs come from, we're

314
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:51,879
able to very easily answer some of the questions with regard to not only the fact of creation,

315
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,199
but answer the question about them being on the earth and roaming the earth at the same

316
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,199
time as man.

317
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:02,559
But then it also leads us to the question of what happened to the dinosaurs.

318
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,279
What happened to the dinosaurs?

319
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,079
And maybe we'd follow it up with this question.

320
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,079
Why are there so many fossils?

321
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,839
Why are there so many fossils?

322
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,159
Well, between the record of Genesis chapter number one and the record of the flood in

323
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:21,759
Genesis six through eight, we understand the timeline that there's roughly 1,656 years

324
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,919
between the creation and the flood.

325
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,279
So 1,656 years.

326
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,999
That's a far cry from 165 million years, but it's 1,656 years.

327
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:37,599
Now remember the climate pre-flood and the way in which the longevity of man, you can

328
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:43,839
read of the time in which man lived and their days, and you can read about just all of the

329
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,799
way in which the climate would support life and allow life to really thrive.

330
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:55,239
And so we find that 1,656 years after creation, we would say, as we look at the word of God,

331
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:59,959
that there was a global flood as is recorded in Genesis six through eight.

332
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:06,239
And the global flood provides us with wonderful answers with regard to answering the question,

333
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,359
what happened to the dinosaurs?

334
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,359
And then follow up question of that, why are there so many fossils?

335
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,919
And so when we begin to answer this question, we would understand as we look at the record

336
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:23,399
of the book of Genesis, that it was not through the flood that every dinosaur was destroyed.

337
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:28,479
See there are some that would teach that have this idea, these evolutionary scientists that

338
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:32,999
would say that when that asteroid hit earth, that basically there are some that would say

339
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,759
that it was in a moment, in an instant, it just destroyed all of them.

340
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,919
And there are some that would say it destroyed most of them.

341
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,999
And then over a period of years, and they speak in terms of millions of years as if

342
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,079
it's just a couple of minutes.

343
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,719
And then, you know, they began to die off entirely.

344
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:52,759
We don't believe that the flood destroyed all of the dinosaurs because Noah was told

345
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,779
to bring dinosaurs or bring all of the animals onto the ark, right?

346
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:03,059
Look in Genesis chapter number 7 if you will, we believe that Noah took dinosaurs onto the

347
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,059
ark.

348
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,699
Now, there are some that immediately oppose that and they say, well, the ark wasn't big

349
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:12,139
enough, there's no way you could get dinosaurs, I mean, look at the size of these sauropods

350
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,299
and T-Rex and all of this.

351
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:20,859
Who said that he had to bring adult grown, fully grown animals onto the ark?

352
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:26,419
There's no need to bring fully grown animals onto the ark.

353
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,579
In fact, it would be much wiser to bring adolescent sized animals onto the ark.

354
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:36,939
Not only would they be smaller, but they would be ready to be productive and reproduce after

355
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,659
they got off the ark.

356
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:41,219
And that's what they were instructed to do, right?

357
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:44,379
Not only Noah and his family, but all of the animals.

358
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:47,499
They were to come off the ark and they were to replenish the earth.

359
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:51,179
And so we find that here in Genesis chapter number 7, in verse number 7, notice what the

360
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,179
word of God says, and Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his son's wives with

361
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,539
him into the ark because of the waters of the flood of clean beasts and of beasts that

362
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,379
are not clean and of fowls and of everything that creepeth upon the earth.

363
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:10,739
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded

364
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:15,299
Noah and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the

365
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,299
earth.

366
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,099
And so God moved and God worked, God created these animals, God brought these animals onto

367
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,019
the ark.

368
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,419
And of course, Noah was responsible for building the ark and what have you.

369
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:30,659
But we find that Noah would take these dinosaurs onto the ark.

370
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,899
Again, not only did they not have to be fully grown dinosaurs, but not every single species

371
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:37,899
of dinosaur.

372
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,419
You think about dogs and you think about the kind, right?

373
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,259
The dog kind.

374
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,599
But then how many variants are there?

375
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,939
When you go through the whole process and you want this breed of dog or that breed of

376
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,979
dog and crossbreeding and so on and so forth.

377
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:53,739
Now, you can't do it with a dog and cat because they're not the same kind, right?

378
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:59,099
We understand that, but we find that you can certainly within the kind, you can have a

379
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,659
variety of families or breeds, if you will.

380
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:10,699
And so we find that here, God specifically in Genesis one repeats kind, kind, kind after

381
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:11,699
his kind.

382
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:15,619
And so it's believed by people that are much smarter than I am, that there were probably

383
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,899
about 60 pairs of dinosaurs that would have to be on the ark.

384
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,579
Now, those 60 pairs of dinosaurs, but it's interesting to understand this, the average

385
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:30,179
size of a dinosaur was the size of a large sheep.

386
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,699
So you have some really big dinosaurs, but you also have some small creatures.

387
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:39,379
And so this is not, when you understand the fact that they weren't these fully grown,

388
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:44,259
they didn't have to be fully grown, and it wasn't that you had to have every variant,

389
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,619
every type that's out there, you would understand that it was certainly adequate for them to

390
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,339
fit on the ark.

391
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,879
We went through, as we talked about the ark many lessons ago, we talked about the size

392
00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:02,339
of the ark and how many freight cars of, you know, cubic feet that they had for storage

393
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,259
and so on and so forth, sufficiently sized for all these creatures.

394
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,619
Let me say this, Noah took all the animals on the ark, including dinosaurs, but we also

395
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,859
understand as we read the Genesis flood, that all living creatures that were not on the

396
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:19,059
ark died.

397
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,379
Genesis 7, continue reading, look down at verse 21.

398
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:28,179
The Bible says, "...and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of

399
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:31,659
cattle and of beasts and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every

400
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:37,979
man and in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land died."

401
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:42,259
Verse 23 of Genesis 7, "...and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the

402
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:46,979
face of the ground, both man and cattle and the creeping thing and the fowl of the heaven,

403
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:52,219
and they were destroyed from the earth, and Noah only remained alive and they that were

404
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:57,019
with him in the ark, and the waters prevailed upon the earth in a hundred and fifty days."

405
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,940
And so all living creatures that were not on the ark died.

406
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
So there were lives.

407
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,220
lots of dinosaurs that died during the flood.

408
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,300
We don't know the number, but we do know this,

409
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,140
and I'm gonna read this to you.

410
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,640
The rocks of the Earth's crust

411
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,460
now contain the fossil remains

412
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,940
of unnumbered billions of plants and animals

413
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,900
buried in water-transported sediments,

414
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,700
which quickly became stone.

415
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,600
This geologic column has been grossly distorted

416
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,540
by evolutionists into the record

417
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,220
of an imagined three-billion-year history of evolution

418
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,380
during the geological ages.

419
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,740
Actually, it represents the deposits

420
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,600
of the cataclysmic flood, with the fossils order

421
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
primarily depicting the relative elevations

422
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,100
of the habitats, and therefore,

423
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,740
the usual order of sedimentary burial in the flood

424
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,020
of the organisms of the pre-flood world.

425
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,420
Many modern geologists are again admitting

426
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,020
the necessity of catastrophic formation and burial

427
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,360
to explain the fossil rocks in the geological column.

428
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,620
The reason why very few fossilized men,

429
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,380
so this is another question that comes up,

430
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,900
why do we find these dinosaurs that are fossilized,

431
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,380
but we don't find men that are fossilized?

432
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,740
And if they lived at the same time,

433
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,459
then you would find, if you're gonna find

434
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,779
fossilized dinosaurs, you should find fossilized men.

435
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,160
I thought it was an interesting statement here.

436
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,260
The reason why very few fossilized men

437
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,900
and also very few fossilized flying birds

438
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,779
are found in the rocks is their high mobility

439
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,300
and ability to escape burial and sediments.

440
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,180
When eventually drowned, their bodies

441
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,300
would remain on the surface until they decayed.

442
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,340
Well, if you decay, you don't fossilize, right?

443
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,380
It just can't happen.

444
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,540
In fact, someone said this, fossils,

445
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,300
in order for a fossil to be created,

446
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,660
they have to be buried fast and deep to be preserved.

447
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
There's no gentle drifting out to sea,

448
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,220
settling to the bottom and then somehow becoming buried

449
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,940
so that no scavengers attack the carcasses.

450
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,000
This was something that happened very quickly.

451
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,580
Now, think about the flood and think about

452
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,779
all of the great deeps opening up and the water coming,

453
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:08,520
and then you begin to think about when the waters assuaged

454
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,720
and how everything was rapidly moving

455
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,500
and all of that earth being so soft

456
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,119
because of the number of days in which

457
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,860
the water was on the earth.

458
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,680
And then when God calls the wind to come

459
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,680
to assuage the waters, I mean, it's just catastrophic event.

460
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,520
And no doubt resulting in many of these fossils

461
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,279
that are being found today.

462
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,680
We not only believe that they were created by God

463
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,440
and that Noah took them on the ark

464
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,279
and those that were not on the ark died in the flood,

465
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,199
but we also believe that they were brought off of the ark.

466
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:48,880
Genesis chapter number eight, verse 15.

467
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,479
Notice in Genesis eight and verse 15,

468
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:55,240
it says, God spake unto Noah saying,

469
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,040
go forth of the ark.

470
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,800
What a wonderful day that must have been.

471
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,680
Amen?

472
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,680
After being on that ark, it's time to get off.

473
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,360
Get off the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons

474
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,639
and thy sons' wives with thee.

475
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:13,520
Notice verse 17, bring forth with thee

476
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,360
every living thing that is with thee

477
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,559
of all flesh, both of fowl and of cattle

478
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,919
and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth

479
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,839
that they may notice that they may breed abundantly

480
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,559
in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.

481
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,559
And Noah went forth and his sons and his wife

482
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
and his sons' wives with him, every beast,

483
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
every creeping thing and every fowl

484
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,520
and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth

485
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,520
after their kinds went forth out of the ark.

486
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,820
Therefore, we would, just as I said earlier,

487
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,080
confidently conclude that man and dinosaur

488
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,320
dwelt at the same time, we would conclude

489
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,160
that dinosaurs lived after the flood.

490
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,880
They lived after the flood.

491
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,639
You say, are you sure about that?

492
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,880
Well, did you just read what I read?

493
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,600
They went on the ark, if everything went on the ark

494
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,199
and then everything came off the ark,

495
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,760
then they existed after the flood.

496
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
So what happened to them?

497
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,540
Why is it that after the ark, of course,

498
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,680
we don't believe in their extinction immediately

499
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,959
because of the flood, but we would find

500
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,739
that they obviously died out after a period of time

501
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,119
and we don't know exactly the time

502
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,220
in all of the regions and what have you,

503
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,959
but the reality is that the post-flood climate

504
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,920
was drastically different than the pre-flood climate.

505
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,920
The climatic changes upon earth, post-flood versus pre-flood

506
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,040
are just amazing.

507
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
I mean, just, you just think about it

508
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,720
in the life expectancy of mankind

509
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,839
and you see the way in which man, very quickly,

510
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,959
their life expectancy decreases after the flood

511
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:53,080
and you begin to see the impact of the climate

512
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
and so we see that lifespan decreases.

513
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,959
Think about the vegetation changes, right?

514
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,239
And so what is the vegetation?

515
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,160
Well, that's a source of sustenance for these animals

516
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,839
and you understand that.

517
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,600
You think about the ice age.

518
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,580
We dealt with a whole lesson on the ice age.

519
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,559
Well, what kind of an impact did the ice age have

520
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,299
upon the dinosaurs?

521
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:17,140
Some animals, no doubt, as they came off the ark

522
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,420
and they began to deal with some of the climatic changes

523
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,580
that were so much drastically different,

524
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,619
the oxygen levels in the atmosphere

525
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,299
are different than they were pre-flood

526
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,580
and just so many variables and you say,

527
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,920
okay, how did all of these things impact

528
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,779
the ability for certain animals to live?

529
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,779
And how did it cause those things to happen?

530
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:40,980
And so we look at that and we find that

531
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,380
all of these factors would contribute

532
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,100
to an eventual extinction of dinosaurs.

533
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,580
I would also say this.

534
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,100
The reality is that the animal-human interaction

535
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,940
differed greatly post-flood.

536
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,920
Pre-flood, there was a way in which God

537
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,100
had given the instruction, as you look in Genesis 1

538
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,399
and we read it earlier, when God created man,

539
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:07,779
he was to have dominion over, right?

540
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,420
And there was this certain level of interaction,

541
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,000
if I can use that terminology this evening,

542
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,320
of how man and animal would interact with each other.

543
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,880
But after the flood, all of those things changed.

544
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,880
We understand that one day, there's going to be

545
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,160
in the millennial kingdom of Christ,

546
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,799
there's going to be a change into the animal kingdom

547
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:30,760
as well and how man interacts with animals

548
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,480
and so on and so forth and you see that.

549
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,019
You read in Isaiah some of those things

550
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:37,119
that God gives us with regard to

551
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,480
the millennial reign of Christ.

552
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,640
And so that difference in the interaction

553
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,100
between these that would now leave the ark

554
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,360
and go to inhabit the earth, you think about

555
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,720
the way in which the Tower of Babel is described

556
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,799
in chapter number 11 of the book of Genesis

557
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,399
and how those people eventually,

558
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,080
after their language was changed,

559
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
how they departed and spread out,

560
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,959
no doubt they would come in contact with dinosaurs.

561
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,200
And what would they do?

562
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,480
How would that interaction be?

563
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,839
And we find there are plenty of historical events

564
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,760
and evidences, if you will,

565
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,720
that would refer to various encounters

566
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,519
that individuals had with these dragons

567
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,279
or these dinosaur-like creatures.

568
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,200
And we find that, as we mentioned earlier

569
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,540
in Job chapter number 40 about behemoth,

570
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,820
we also would understand and say tonight,

571
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,200
we're not gonna look at the references

572
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,559
because there's many of them,

573
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,739
but you would understand that in the word of God

574
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:43,739
in our Bibles, the word dragon appears several times.

575
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,220
And so that word dragon, again,

576
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,339
it's not the word dinosaur

577
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:47,660
because the word dinosaur didn't exist,

578
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,640
but it's the word dragon.

579
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,739
You read about behemoth, you read about Leviathan,

580
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,540
you read about these dragons

581
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,940
that are mentioned in the word of God,

582
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,420
and you begin to see how the word of God

583
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,779
provides us with evidence that yes, dinosaurs existed.

584
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,820
We're not some backwards group of people.

585
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,100
Oh, you're a biblical Christian

586
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,459
and you don't believe in dinosaurs.

587
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:08,580
No, we believe in dinosaurs.

588
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,339
It's just what we believe about dinosaurs

589
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:12,779
varies greatly from what you believe about dinosaurs

590
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,459
because we don't believe that they evolved

591
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,860
from some other type of reptile.

592
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,559
We don't believe that they were here for 165 million years

593
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,260
and then all of a sudden an asteroid came and destroyed them

594
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,459
and then 65 million years later after that, man showed up.

595
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:27,619
We just go ahead and get rid of all of that.

596
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,220
We don't believe that.

597
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,059
Why?

598
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,580
Because we believe and start with the word of God.

599
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,220
What does God's word tell us?

600
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,619
In addition to having the word of God,

601
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,580
I thought it was noteworthy of interest

602
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,059
to share some things with you

603
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,500
about some just historical evidence, if you will,

604
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,419
for us to understand the truth

605
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:49,460
that dinosaurs existed after the flood.

606
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Now, I don't know, I've not done surveys on this,

607
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,119
I didn't read a whole lot on this,

608
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,140
but I began the message this evening

609
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,979
by saying that there are times in which

610
00:38:58,979 --> 00:39:03,299
we as Christians may shy away or avoid a conversation

611
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,299
with somebody about dinosaurs

612
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,260
because we just don't know how to talk about it.

613
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,580
There's also the subject matter,

614
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,979
there are some that just have the answer

615
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:14,979
that dinosaurs were destroyed during the flood entirely,

616
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,700
but that doesn't answer the question

617
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,940
of some of these historical evidences

618
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,739
of dinosaurs existing after the flood.

619
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:25,559
And so just as Noah would have taken dinosaurs onto the ark,

620
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,599
we've already dealt with the fact

621
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,679
that he would have brought them off of the ark,

622
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,700
so it's easy for us to acknowledge this evening

623
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,260
that no, the flood didn't destroy all of the dinosaurs

624
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,000
because they came off of the ark.

625
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,520
A number of events took place,

626
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,260
obviously through all of those factors

627
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,140
that we mentioned a few moments ago,

628
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,900
eventually they would become extinct,

629
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,619
but I wanna share with you just a few historical evidences,

630
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,419
and you can look these things up and see their validity,

631
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:55,220
but Alexander the Great, as he was going and conquering

632
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,099
and moving forth, when he went into India in 326 BC,

633
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,260
he gave record of finding hissing dragons.

634
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,960
that were very descriptive-like to some of these types of dinosaurs that you hear about.

635
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,960
In fact, many of us know about Marco Polo, and it's more than just a game that you play Marco Polo,

636
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,460
and you kind of answer it, so on and so forth, but there was this man, The Travels of Marco Polo, right?

637
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,860
He traveled all over the place, and he would describe in this book, The Travels of Marco Polo,

638
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,060
he described in great detail a number of the animals that he would see in different parts of the world

639
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,660
during his travels, and no doubt, if you were to read through the descriptions,

640
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,460
he definitely could have had some contact with some dinosaurs as he had these travels.

641
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,260
I would say this, there's this ancient Egyptian plaque, and the Narmer Palette,

642
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:57,260
it depicts humans handling two creatures that are obvious long-necked dinosaurs.

643
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:03,460
So how do they have this plaque that depicts these humans that are handling this dinosaur?

644
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,560
If dinosaurs and humans didn't exist at the same time, or if dinosaurs were done away with during the flood,

645
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,060
and they just ended, and so on and so forth, well, there's evidences out there that these dinosaurs existed,

646
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:20,960
and they have these. There's a Stegosaurus carving on a Cambodian temple wall,

647
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,360
and this Stegosaurus that's carved on this wall in this Cambodian temple,

648
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:32,460
it was carved nearly 800 years before any fossil of a Stegosaurus was ever found.

649
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,460
That's interesting. I mean, somebody just make it up?

650
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,560
No, they probably saw them. They lived there. They dwelled in that area.

651
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,160
It's also interesting, how many of you have ever gone to a Chinese restaurant,

652
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,160
and you sat down to eat, and they have that little placemat that has all those little animals,

653
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,560
and you are the year of the—I'm the year of the monkey, 1980, year of the monkey.

654
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,160
I don't know. It just is what it is, right? The Chinese Zodiac.

655
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,860
The Chinese Zodiac has 12 animals on it. 11 of them are animals that we know.

656
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,360
But then there's a dragon. There's a dragon.

657
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,860
And many people would say, as they would look at that Chinese Zodiac,

658
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,360
that it features these 12 animals, and that 11 are real, and one is mythological.

659
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,660
Does that really make sense?

660
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,160
If they have 11 known animals that we can still see today, that we still understand what they are,

661
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,860
then they have this dragon. I think that it's a better explanation to say that they encountered

662
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,360
these types of dinosaurs, these dragon-like animals,

663
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,760
and they probably called them dragons because, remember, it wasn't until 1841

664
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,860
that the word dinosaur was ever used in the English language.

665
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,360
I want to read this to you as well as we conclude this evening.

666
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,160
This is an article that was written in June of 2020.

667
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,460
So just a year and a couple of weeks ago, it was written on June 10th of 2020.

668
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:01,660
And it says, in 2017, so a few years ago, a large dinosaur was discovered, washed out to sea,

669
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,360
and it was similar to a dinosaur bone that was found 70 miles off of Norway's coast.

670
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Only this one was partially intact, nearly perfectly preserved.

671
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,560
And here's something that's very interesting.

672
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,860
It still contained its last meal fossilized inside its stomach.

673
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,860
That's of interest, is it not?

674
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,860
I read part of this a moment ago, but fossils have to be buried fast and deep to be preserved.

675
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,560
There's no gentle drifting out to sea, settling to the bottom,

676
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,760
and then somehow becoming buried so that no scavengers attack the carcass.

677
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,560
As the dinosaurs did various research and what have you on this particular fossil,

678
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:48,560
they discovered that there were 48 varieties of plants in this dinosaur's stomach.

679
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,560
They made very interesting comments with regard to the plants that were found

680
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,560
and just the plant structure and so on and so forth.

681
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,560
And they say this, the man that wrote the article says,

682
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,560
obviously the dinosaur was buried so quickly in the ocean

683
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,560
that even its stomach contents didn't have time to rot.

684
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,560
And then he asked this question, how do you explain that?

685
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
What's your explanation for that?

686
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,560
How does someone explain this?

687
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,559
And he says this, again, to answer or to ask the question that I mentioned at the very beginning,

688
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,559
the problem is not what we see, but how we interpret what we see.

689
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,559
So when somebody sees this and they see this fossil, this dinosaur,

690
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,559
and it's got its last meal fossilized in its stomach, it didn't even rot, it didn't decay,

691
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,559
it's fossilized in its stomach, 48 varieties of plants.

692
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,559
How does that happen?

693
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,559
The man that wrote this article says the best explanation for this wonderfully preserved dinosaur

694
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,559
and its intact stomach contents is that it was buried rapidly in the flood.

695
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,559
Only a global flood with massive tsunami-like waves could transport a nearly intact

696
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:06,559
one-and-a-half ton dinosaur out to sea and bury it fast enough to preserve it so perfectly.

697
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:13,559
That was a great conclusion to this particular article with regard to how do you explain what you're seeing.

698
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,559
We don't have to be afraid of talking to people about dinosaurs.

699
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,559
But I will caution you with this, most people aren't coming from a biblical worldview.

700
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,559
So when you begin with a biblical worldview, you understand that people are going to oppose that.

701
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,559
But I would tell you this, especially for those that have children at home

702
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,559
and some of the little kids that were so excited about dinosaurs and so on and so forth,

703
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,559
little Ari had a dinosaur shirt on, I saw him on Friday and he had a dinosaur shirt on,

704
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,559
and kids like dinosaurs.

705
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:50,559
But I would caution you with regard to dinosaurs because the world teaches something entirely different

706
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,559
than what the Word of God would say about dinosaurs.

707
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,559
When they begin to teach all of their evolutionary nonsense and they teach all of their stuff

708
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,559
about all of these millions and billions of years,

709
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,559
it really can undermine the authority of the Word of God with regard to other subject matters.

710
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:12,559
And so I would encourage that we would be able to adequately go to the Word of God and say,

711
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,559
here's what God's Word says.

712
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,559
You don't have to see the word dinosaur to understand that these beasts exist.

713
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:27,559
And that though that word isn't used, it wasn't used for a long time in any other writings.

714
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,559
So why criticize the Bible because the word isn't there?

715
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,559
It wasn't a word that existed.

716
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,559
And therefore that argument should be thrown out, in my opinion.

717
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,559
And so this evening, we can answer the question, where did dinosaurs come from?

718
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:44,559
God made them. God made them.

719
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,559
Did dinosaurs and humans live at the same time?

720
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,559
Emphatically, yes. Absolutely.

721
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:57,559
To the best of our understanding of Genesis chapter 1, they were created on the same exact day.

722
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,559
Where did they go? What happened to them?

723
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:03,559
Why so many fossils?

724
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,559
There was a global flood.

725
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,559
And only the things that were taken onto the ark,

726
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,559
only Noah and his wife and his three sons and their wives, eight people,

727
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,559
they were the only ones saved.

728
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:16,559
And the animals that were brought thereon.

729
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,559
Every other thing died.

730
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,559
Therefore you have lots of fossils, billions of fossils.

731
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:26,559
We find that one day when God said,

732
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,559
alright Noah, the waters have assuaged, it's time to come off the ark.

733
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,559
Not only did Noah and his family come off, but all the animals came off, including dinosaurs.

734
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,559
And therefore we have records, of some of which I shared with you this evening,

735
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,559
we have these historical records of man interacting with dinosaurs.

736
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:54,559
Man depicting dinosaurs in very old carvings and paintings and what have you.

737
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,559
Why? Because they exist.

738
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,559
They existed.

739
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,559
And they're a real thing.

740
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,559
And so we don't have to shy away from it. We don't have to be fearful of it.

741
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,559
And we start with the Bible and we end with the Bible.

742
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,559
Here's what the Word of God says.

743
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,559
Understand, the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,

744
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:15,559
their foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned.

745
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,559
People continue to push away the record of Genesis,

746
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,559
and they seek to interpret things through their own mind and their own understanding.

747
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,559
But the reality is that God's record makes a lot of sense.

748
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,559
It gives us the truth. Why?

749
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,559
Because He is the truth.

750
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,559
And He is the Creator.

751
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,559
And He says, here's how it all happened.

752
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,559
We love you. We thank you for loving us.

753
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:44,559
I know it was a very teachy type of a message this evening,

754
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:54,559
but I hope that somehow tonight you have strengthened us in our ability to have confidence in your Word

755
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,559
with regard even to the subject matter of dinosaurs.

756
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,559
There are times in which we see things.

757
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:02,559
Perhaps we've been taught things in some other setting somewhere,

758
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,559
maybe in college or elsewhere,

759
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:09,559
where people have sought to teach us something entirely different with regard to dinosaurs.

760
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,559
And maybe we just felt inadequate on being able to answer the question

761
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,559
or even to engage in discussion with someone.

762
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:25,559
God, I pray that you'd help us tonight to once again have that firm foundation of your Word,

763
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,559
knowing that you've given us the truth,

764
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,559
knowing that you are the Creator of all things,

765
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:37,559
and that you've given us a record that provides us with answers to many of these questions.

766
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,559
I pray that you'd strengthen our faith.

767
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,559
Lord, we pray that you'd give us a blessed time of fellowship tonight as we have birthday fellowship.

768
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:49,559
I pray that you would be exalted in our midst, that you'd help us to have a sweet time,

769
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:51,559
and we'll thank you for all that you'll do.

770
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:52,559
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
