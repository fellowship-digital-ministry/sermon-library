1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
contrast that was given to us in 2 Corinthians chapter number 3 between law and grace consumed

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,699
the chapter.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,159
We noted several things.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:16,100
We said this, the law condemns, but grace, or the gospel, converts.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,420
And I'm so thankful for the power of the gospel.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:25,180
We find that the law had glory that fadeth, but grace has glory that excels.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,139
The law is intended to bring us to Christ, but grace can make us like Christ.

8
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:35,740
And what a blessing to know the truth of the ministry.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,159
The apostle Paul started talking about the ministry at the end of chapter number 2.

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,119
He continued in chapter number 3, making this contrast through the ministry.

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,580
He will now continue through chapter 4, 5, and part of chapter number 6 discussing the

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,139
ministry.

13
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:57,500
And I can almost see, as we look at this portion of scripture in 2 Corinthians chapter

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,380
number 4, I can almost see the countenance of the apostle Paul.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,440
I can almost hear the excitement in his voice as we read the opening statement of 2 Corinthians

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,139
chapter number 4 where he says, therefore, and remember, every time you see a therefore

17
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,419
you find out what it's there for.

18
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:18,260
And we find that in chapter number 3 he's talking about the glory of the ministry, that

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,660
we see, yes, the law, the letter, it killeth, but the spirit, grace, it gives life.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,660
And this was temporary, but this is permanent, and we have been given.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,260
Notice he says, therefore, seeing we have this ministry.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:42,019
And oh, what a ministry it is, and how glorious it is to know the truth of the word of God.

23
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,739
This ministry that Paul is referring to is the one that gives life.

24
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,300
It's the one that he refers to in 2 Corinthians 3 as the ministration of righteousness.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,860
And we talked about chapter 5 and verse 21, how God made Jesus to be sin for us who knew

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,620
no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,220
It's the ministry that excels in glory.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,020
And again, I can almost hear the excitement in the voice of the apostle Paul as he says,

29
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:20,500
Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, notice, as we have received mercy, we faint not, but

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,300
have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,619
word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every

32
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,619
man's conscience in the sight of God.

33
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:41,779
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world

34
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:47,660
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,660
of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,940
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,500
Jesus' sake.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,660
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts

39
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,940
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

40
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:24,380
Notice verse 7, but we have, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,940
of the power may be of God and not of us.

42
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,380
This morning from verse number 7, I've adopted the title for the message, This Treasure in

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,779
Earthen Vessels.

44
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:39,740
We're just clay.

45
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,820
We're just human, frail flesh, but we've been redeemed by the blood of Christ.

46
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,460
And Paul says we have this treasure, speaking about the gospel, in earthen vessels.

47
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,020
It's an amazing thing.

48
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,020
In Sunday school this morning, Brother Jeff talked about and he mentioned that God has

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,020
no other plan for delivering the gospel.

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,460
His plan for delivering the gospel is you and me.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,899
God's plan for delivering the gospel to a lost and dying world is those that have been

52
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,300
saved by the grace of God.

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,519
Those who understand the truth of the gospel, those that understand that all are sinners,

54
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,059
and that Jesus, the Son of God, God in flesh, that He is the Savior of the world, that He

55
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:27,059
went to that cross not for His own sin, but for our sin.

56
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:32,779
He bled and He died, He was buried and He rose again, and He delivers, He offers this

57
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,859
free gift of eternal life.

58
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:40,980
It's why we go out on Saturday mornings, it's why we have gospel tracks in our track rack,

59
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,859
it's why we encourage you week after week to tell somebody about Jesus.

60
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:51,260
We sang the song to start the service this morning, I love to tell the story.

61
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,899
The third verse of that song says, for some have never heard the message of salvation

62
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,619
from God's own Holy Word.

63
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:05,100
The reality this morning that as we sit here with about a population of eight billion people

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:14,339
in our world today, that multiple billions of them have never heard the truth that Jesus saves.

65
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,540
The reality this morning is that people in our communities, in our neighborhoods, in

66
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,540
your family, and in my family, in our workplaces, that they need to hear the gospel.

67
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,739
And Paul says, we have this ministry.

68
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:37,420
He says, we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,220
This morning as we look at this text of Scripture, I want you to notice first of all with me,

70
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,899
notice what Paul recognized.

71
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:49,820
I have two points for the message this morning, but point number one has seven sub points.

72
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,660
And the reality is that Paul recognized seven things in this text of Scripture that he reveals

73
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,980
to us, and I believe they're important for us to recognize as well.

74
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,019
The apostle Paul, of course, had understood the transforming power of the gospel.

75
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,700
He experienced it personally in his life, and for those of you that are here this morning

76
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,779
that you have been saved by the grace of God, you too have experienced the power of the gospel.

77
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,940
And Paul, as he's writing to these believers in Corinth and he's expounding on this truth

78
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,500
of the ministry that we've been given, and he's providing this truth, he reveals to them

79
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,260
these seven things that he recognizes.

80
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:38,619
Number one, I believe from verse number one, he recognized the responsibility of ministry.

81
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,700
The responsibility of ministry.

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,299
So often we talk about, and even as I prayed with Dean this morning to start the service,

83
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:50,579
Dean said this as he prayed, he said, God, you've been so good to us, you've given us

84
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:57,500
so much, and help us to remember the truth that to whom much is given, much is required.

85
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,260
And the reality is that is a Bible truth, a Bible principle, and we have been given

86
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,339
a great responsibility.

87
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:10,619
And the apostle Paul, notice he says, therefore seeing, we have this ministry.

88
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:14,339
He says, as we have received mercy, we faint not.

89
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,500
And so we begin to look at verse number one and understanding that Paul recognizes the

90
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,339
responsibility of ministry.

91
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,140
And a number of other places, in fact, as Paul writes previous to the church in Corinth

92
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,779
in 1 Corinthians chapter number nine, he speaks about the importance of understanding

93
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,299
the responsibility that has been given to him.

94
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:41,500
And he says it this way, in 1 Corinthians 9, in verse number 16, for though I preach

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,540
the gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto

96
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,320
me if I preach not the gospel.

97
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,839
He says in verse 23, and this I do, for what?

98
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,200
For the gospel's sake.

99
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,279
See, the apostle Paul, he says that he's preaching the gospel, but he has no reason to glory.

100
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,239
He says that there's this necessity that's laid upon him.

101
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:14,679
He understood the great responsibility that had been entrusted to him as being a recipient

102
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,679
of the gospel.

103
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:19,779
And yes, the apostle Paul was called into the gospel ministry.

104
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:20,779
He was an apostle.

105
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,179
We understand that he laid that out in 2 Corinthians chapter number one.

106
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:29,179
But the reality is as he's speaking to the church in Corinth and he's writing to them,

107
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:37,780
he says, therefore saying, we, that's plural, that's not singular, we have this ministry.

108
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,020
And the reality is that there is a responsibility that is laid upon every child of God to be

109
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,440
a preacher of the gospel, to understand the ministry that has been entrusted to us.

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Look at Romans chapter one, if you will, and I want you to notice, in fact, as you

111
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,960
look at Romans one, verse 16, of course, is a very familiar verse of scripture.

112
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,719
I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, and we'll look at that here in just a moment.

113
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:04,559
But I want to back up and look at the entirety, really three statements that the apostle Paul

114
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,559
makes in this opening chapter of Romans chapter one.

115
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,640
And he says in verse number 14, and this helps me to be able to gather and understand the

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,359
significance of the responsibility of ministry.

117
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,200
He says, I am debtor.

118
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,440
I want you to think about that phrase just for a moment.

119
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
The apostle Paul understood that he had been entrusted with something.

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,119
The gospel was not his own, it's the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

121
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:37,520
He had not been taught, as you read Galatians chapter number one, from other men and so

122
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,960
on and so forth, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

123
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,640
And we find that the apostle Paul, he understood this great responsibility, and he says, I

124
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,159
am debtor.

125
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,799
He says both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

126
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,559
And so Paul understood that he had been given something that was to be delivered to other

127
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,559
people.

128
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:05,919
the wonderful account when we read about the Christmas account and the birth of our Savior.

129
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,119
And the angels come and they make an announcement to the shepherds and they say that they bring

130
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,959
these glad tidings to you.

131
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,439
Remember it says, which shall be to all people.

132
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:21,759
And the reality is that those glad tidings that were brought to the shepherds was not

133
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,279
to just stay with the shepherds, it was something that was to be delivered to others.

134
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,879
And Paul says, I am indebted.

135
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,319
And I have been given something from Christ that others need.

136
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:39,199
And I've been given a responsibility to deliver the truth of the gospel.

137
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,499
He goes on in verse 15 and says, I am ready.

138
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:47,199
So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

139
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,959
And how is it that we could be ready, prepared?

140
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,839
I mean, at every moment to give an answer, and I know in my life, and I'll be transparent

141
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,839
with you.

142
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
And I know I've said this before from the pulpit, and I'm sure that you've experienced

143
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,959
it as well.

144
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,999
Many of you have shared it with me.

145
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,799
There are times that we miss the opportunity.

146
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:10,259
There are times in which we leave from a place and we did not take the opportunity that God

147
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,959
had given to us to share the gospel.

148
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,680
And we need to be ready.

149
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,799
We need to be looking for those opportunities.

150
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,399
We need to be gospel minded that the purpose is I want to be able to share the gospel with

151
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,699
this individual.

152
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:28,220
And then he says, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of

153
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,939
God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

154
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,860
Oh, we should never be ashamed of the gospel.

155
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
We may be ridiculed.

156
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,099
We may be laughed at.

157
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,379
Somebody may say, I'm not interested.

158
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,299
They may say whatever they want to say.

159
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:47,199
But the reality is that we know the power of the gospel.

160
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:53,680
And I need not, you need not to be ashamed of the gospel, the responsibility of ministry.

161
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,599
We see also from verse number one, number two, or the second thought with regard to

162
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:02,680
what Paul recognized, not only the responsibility of ministry, but he recognized the privilege

163
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,599
of ministry.

164
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,880
It's important that we understand these two truths this morning.

165
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,720
It's important to understand responsibility and to understand duty, but can I tell you

166
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,039
that it's a privilege, it is a delight to be able to share the gospel with someone.

167
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,239
If you've had the privilege as God has given to me, many times the privilege of being able

168
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:35,279
to talk with someone and see them bow their head and trust Christ as their savior.

169
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,959
Aside from my own salvation, it's probably the most glorious thing I've ever experienced

170
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,199
to see someone else born again.

171
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:44,399
It's exciting.

172
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,599
It's awesome.

173
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,119
It's a privilege.

174
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:52,500
Yes, we can speak about the responsibility and we should, but we must acknowledge this

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,300
morning that it's an absolute privilege.

176
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,539
He says we have received, notice he says, therefore seeing we have this ministry as

177
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,419
we have received mercy, we faint not.

178
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,220
He's been given this ministry.

179
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,720
And I think about what he says in 1 Thessalonians chapter two, in verse number four, as he's

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:18,020
writing to this church and he's expressing the same truth of the privilege of ministry.

181
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:24,459
In 1 Thessalonians two and verse number four, notice Paul says, but as we were allowed of

182
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:25,459
God.

183
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,459
Now think about that just for a moment.

184
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:33,699
He says we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel.

185
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:40,099
Even so we speak not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

186
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,819
We were allowed of God.

187
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,059
You think about a privilege.

188
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,380
I remember you think about kids maybe in school and I remember having different privileges.

189
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,699
A teacher would say, we're going to allow you to do this.

190
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:54,819
We're going to give you this privilege, or you're in some capacity and you've been given

191
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,259
this privilege to do something.

192
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,599
You've been allowed to do it.

193
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,899
You've been entrusted with something.

194
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:07,679
And the God of the universe, the creator, he has allowed us.

195
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:14,279
He has given to us and entrusted to us the gospel.

196
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,119
What a privilege.

197
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:21,980
The king of kings and Lord of lords, the great I am, the Lord God omnipotent.

198
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,320
He says, I'm going to, I'm going to allow you to be in trust with the gospel.

199
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Wow.

200
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,480
What a privilege.

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,079
What a privilege that has been given to us.

202
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,320
The third thing that Paul recognizes still in verse number one is the enabling for ministry.

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Notice he says, we have received mercy.

204
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,799
We faint not.

205
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm thankful for God's enablement, God's grace to save, but God's grace for service.

206
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,359
His grace is sufficient and he enables us.

207
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:06,279
Paul will give his testimony in first Timothy chapter one and verse number two, yeah, first

208
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,839
Timothy chapter one and verse number 12.

209
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,000
And this is a verse that Holly has claimed really as a life verse and any, any email

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,559
that you'd receive from her.

211
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:24,040
She has this in her correspondence and I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who hath enabled me

212
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,160
for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.

213
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,799
Paul says, God enabled me.

214
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,579
He says, we have received mercy.

215
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,799
He says, we faint not.

216
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,119
He'll say again in second Corinthians chapter four and verse number 16, for which cause

217
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,359
we faint not.

218
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:50,720
But though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day and we'll

219
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,239
focus on the latter part of chapter four next Sunday morning.

220
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:58,399
But he speaks about all of the opposition that he faced and all of the difficulty that

221
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,399
he endured.

222
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,639
But we find that he says in verse number one, that he has been enabled by God for this ministry.

223
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,000
Can I tell you this morning, the truth of John 15, when he stood with his disciples

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,480
and said to them, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

225
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,079
And he said to them, without me, ye can do nothing.

226
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,320
You know, what's the most frustrating thing about ministry is if you try to do it in your

227
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
own power.

228
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,160
You try to do it with your own strength, but we find that his strength and his grace

229
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,359
and his mercy enables us to do what God has called us to do.

230
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,160
And I'm so thankful for God's enabling.

231
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,799
In verse two, we find that Paul recognized number four, the seriousness of ministry.

232
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,880
Listen, this ministry that God has called us to is the ministry of life and death.

233
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,639
This thing that Paul mentions in chapter three is he gives this contrast and he's speaking

234
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,200
about the ministry and he's talking about the Old Testament and the law, but then the

235
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,559
New Testament and grace and the gospel, and this is a matter of life and death.

236
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,119
This is of utmost importance.

237
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,600
This is serious what we're engaged in.

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,359
And Paul says it this way in verse number two, we've renounced the hidden things of

239
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,519
dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but

240
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,679
by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the

241
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:31,799
sight of God.

242
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,760
He had said earlier in chapter number two in verse number 17, for we are not as many

243
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,440
which corrupt the word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of God and the sight of God speak we

244
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
in Christ.

245
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,799
The seriousness of ministry.

246
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,919
Listen, we are, he says we've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, really in this

247
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,760
verse of Scripture he's making this contrast between the false teachers and their behaviors

248
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,320
and their approach versus his own understanding of the ministry and what he recognized and

249
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:11,799
the importance of the seriousness of the ministry that God has called us to.

250
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:18,000
When we recognize the seriousness of something, it causes us to have a perspective that is

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
appropriate.

252
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, if we don't see it as being a serious thing, it's just kind of, well, whatever,

253
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,239
if I get a chance, if I, but we see how serious this thing is, this ministry that we've been

254
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:36,400
entrusted with, that we've been privileged, that we've been enabled.

255
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,279
And Paul says this is a serious thing.

256
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,960
Notice the purpose of ministry.

257
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,159
He recognizes number five, there's a great purpose.

258
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,960
In verse number three, and again in verse number six, Paul mentions about if our gospel

259
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,239
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

260
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm not going to ask you this morning to raise your hand, but I'm going to ask this question

261
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
and answer it in your heart.

262
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,119
How many of you know a lost person?

263
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,400
I think every single one of us would have to acknowledge this morning that we know a

264
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,440
lost person, that we know someone who's not saved.

265
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:20,719
And if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

266
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:24,640
I've said this many times, there's two categories of people in the world.

267
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,320
There are saved people and there are lost people.

268
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,880
There are saved people and there are lost people.

269
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,239
And it's the responsibility and the privilege of the saved people to take the gospel to

270
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:40,479
the lost people so that the lost people can hear the gospel and they can Lord willing

271
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,200
respond to the gospel and be saved so they can be saved people.

272
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Amen.

273
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,719
I mentioned this from John chapter number one, where the Bible says that he came to

274
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:52,599
his own, but his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them gave he power

275
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:56,640
to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.

276
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,640
In the reality in John chapter number one, as you read verses 11 and 12, it says,

277
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,120
11 and 12, you find that they had an opportunity,

278
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,680
there's a decision that has to be made.

279
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,280
They rejected, but then they received,

280
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
but as many as received him.

281
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,240
The problem today is many people don't even know

282
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
that there's a decision that they have to make.

283
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,020
They've never been confronted with the truth of the gospel.

284
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,460
We find that Paul says, if our gospel be hid,

285
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,240
it is hid to them that are lost.

286
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,960
Notice verse six, but God,

287
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,120
he references all the way back to Genesis 1

288
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,960
and creation, but God, who commanded the light

289
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,240
to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts

290
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,320
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

291
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,040
in the face of Jesus Christ.

292
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,480
Jesus said this in Luke chapter 19 in verse number 10,

293
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,420
the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

294
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,200
We find the purpose even given to us

295
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,520
when it says that his name shall be called Jesus,

296
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,460
for he shall save his people from their sins.

297
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,360
The purpose is clear on why Jesus came to this earth.

298
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
The purpose is clear for why God

299
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,080
has given to us this ministry.

300
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,760
There are people that are lost.

301
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,640
There are people that need to hear.

302
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,640
We find that he says this,

303
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,560
he recognized number six, the opposition to ministry.

304
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,440
How many of you found that there's opposition to ministry?

305
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,920
How many of you found that there's opposition

306
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
when you try to share the gospel?

307
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
There's someone that wants to tell you

308
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
you're not allowed to talk about this.

309
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,880
There's somebody to tell you whatever

310
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,200
they're gonna tell you and you're not allowed to do this

311
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,960
and so on and so forth and maybe threats

312
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,640
and there's opposition, but I want you to understand

313
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
that it's a spiritual battle

314
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,420
because we find in verse number four

315
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,100
that Paul lays out very clearly

316
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,740
this spiritual warfare that's taking place

317
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,700
and the opposition to ministry.

318
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,060
He says in verse number four,

319
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,180
in whom the God of this world, you see it's a little g,

320
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,220
it's speaking of Satan, the enemy.

321
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,380
In whom the God of this world

322
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,660
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

323
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,540
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,

324
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,260
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

325
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,380
There's opposition to ministry.

326
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,900
Paul was very familiar.

327
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,580
He had experienced regularly as you study the book of Acts

328
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,900
and you trace the steps of the apostle Paul

329
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,220
through the missionary journeys,

330
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,460
you find that it seems everywhere that Paul ever went,

331
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,680
he faced opposition.

332
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,100
There's opposition.

333
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
You find this morning that the more you try

334
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,400
to share the gospel, the more opposition you'll find.

335
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,020
But don't let that discourage you.

336
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,580
Just recognize that that's part of the battle

337
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,220
that we're involved in, engaged in.

338
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,420
It's part of it.

339
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,980
And if everyone quits at the moment of opposition,

340
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,020
then no one will ever preach the gospel.

341
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,900
We find that we just continue on.

342
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,140
We just continue knowing that God is able.

343
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,700
I want you to look at Luke chapter eight.

344
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
I want you to actually turn there.

345
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,980
I know I've quoted a few verses,

346
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
but I want you to turn to Luke chapter eight

347
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,900
just for a moment.

348
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,940
I want you to think about this parable

349
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,100
that the Lord Jesus Christ gives.

350
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,460
The explanation that's provided when we think

351
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,560
about the opposition to ministry,

352
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,780
the Lord Jesus Christ is going to give this parable

353
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,540
and it starts, we're not gonna read the entirety of it.

354
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,980
But in verse number five, notice what Jesus says.

355
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,280
A sower went out to sow his seed.

356
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,060
And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside

357
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,300
and it was trodden down

358
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,540
and the fowls of the air devoured it.

359
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,460
We find in verse number 11,

360
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,140
as the Lord Jesus Christ is going to give an answer

361
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,460
in verse nine, the disciples said,

362
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,140
what might this parable be?

363
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,260
And Jesus is gonna give just this further insight

364
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,460
and he's gonna give explanation.

365
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,780
And notice in verse number 11, Jesus says this.

366
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,820
Now the parable is this.

367
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,620
The seed is the word of God.

368
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,360
The seed is the word of God.

369
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,960
When I went to Mexico on our missions trip,

370
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,740
we got all these containers of scripture

371
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,220
into this building that had been rented

372
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,780
to store all of the scripture.

373
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,380
We had full Bibles, we had New Testaments,

374
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,660
we had the book of Romans, we had gospel tracts

375
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,540
and it was all being unloaded from these containers

376
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,480
and we're working and we're loading.

377
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,220
And the barn as we referred to it,

378
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,860
and it wasn't a barn, it was a building,

379
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,460
but we referred to it as a barn.

380
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,260
The barn was basically empty

381
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,620
and then the containers of scripture came

382
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,900
and we're loading and we're loading.

383
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,700
And here's what we said when we got done.

384
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,460
The barn is now full, but the seed cannot stay in the barn.

385
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,420
Any farmer knows that you gotta get the seed in the ground.

386
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,260
You can't keep the seed in the barn

387
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,500
and expect that you're gonna have a harvest.

388
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,460
No farmer's gonna walk out during harvest time,

389
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,180
during reaping time and expect to see

390
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,220
and gather some great harvest

391
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,660
knowing that during the time of sowing,

392
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,060
he let the seed sit in the barn.

393
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,140
This morning, the seed is the word of God.

394
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,620
The seed, listen, I'm thankful for church.

395
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,780
I love church, I love church.

396
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,180
But you know, the ministry really starts

397
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,580
when we leave these doors.

398
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,140
Seriously.

399
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,300
Notice verse 12, those by the wayside,

400
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,820
are they that hear, then cometh,

401
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,020
what does the Bible tell you?

402
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,940
The devil.

403
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,620
What did it say in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse number four?

404
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,660
In verse number four, it said that the God of this world

405
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,020
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

406
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,460
We see that here, as we look, it says that this,

407
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,180
those by the wayside, are they that hear,

408
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,660
then cometh the devil and taketh away the word

409
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,180
out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

410
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,980
The work that we're engaged in is a spiritual work.

411
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,780
And there is opposition, but we must be faithful.

412
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,060
Oh, how important it is that we're prayed up.

413
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,300
How important it is that we're enabled by God,

414
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,360
that we have the power of the Holy Spirit.

415
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,180
We find that in Acts chapter one,

416
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,260
but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost

417
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,180
has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me,

418
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,940
both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

419
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,460
and the uttermost part of the earth.

420
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,180
And so the responsibility and the important aspect

421
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,500
is that yes, we need to go and be witnesses.

422
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,820
We need to go and proclaim the gospel,

423
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,360
but we must go in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

424
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,980
It's absolutely imperative,

425
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,980
because this work has opposition, and it's a spiritual work.

426
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,820
I want you to notice the seventh thing

427
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,380
that the Apostle Paul recognized

428
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,300
from this portion of scripture is the joy of ministry.

429
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,180
The joy of ministry.

430
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,860
You say, aren't there hardships in ministry?

431
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,660
Sure there are, but the joy of ministry.

432
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,340
We find that in verse number seven,

433
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,940
if we look at that verse, it says,

434
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,540
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels

435
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,500
that the excellency of the power may be of God

436
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,940
and not of us.

437
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,740
Listen, it's all about God.

438
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,100
It's not about us.

439
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,220
It's about him.

440
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,300
This treasure.

441
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,740
I love the word, the usage here,

442
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,180
that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

443
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
We're frail.

444
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,220
In fact, the Old Testament tells us that he knows our frame.

445
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,980
He knows that we're but dust.

446
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,100
We are frail, but he, Christ in us, the hope of glory,

447
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,180
and he has given to us this treasure in earthen vessels,

448
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,180
the truth of the gospel, and the joy of ministry.

449
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,820
In Luke chapter number 15 and verse number seven,

450
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,180
we're told this, and it's a wonderful reminder for us

451
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,700
with regard to the joy of ministry.

452
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,460
It says, I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven

453
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,620
over one sinner that repenteth,

454
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,619
more than over 99 just persons which need no repentance.

455
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,580
There's joy in heaven over one sinner that's saved.

456
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:44,739
There's so many things that we should recognize.

457
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,580
We find that Paul notes these seven things

458
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,059
as he's speaking about the ministry

459
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,460
and is explaining to the believers in Corinth

460
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,179
about the ministry, and he goes through and he says,

461
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,700
I've recognized these things about the ministry.

462
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,260
There's joy in serving Jesus.

463
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
I want you to look at 1 Peter chapter one

464
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,220
just for a moment, and I want you to notice this truth

465
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,660
that Peter reveals to us about this ministry

466
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,619
in 1 Peter chapter one, and then we'll move forward here

467
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,460
in 2 Corinthians four and be done this morning,

468
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,260
but I want you to notice in 1 Peter chapter number one,

469
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,100
we think about this ministry, the truth of the gospel

470
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,820
and the truth of the message from last week

471
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,739
and this morning and looking at all of this combined,

472
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:30,140
and we find that in 1 Peter chapter one,

473
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,220
that Peter says this in verse number 10,

474
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,700
notice what he says, of which salvation

475
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,700
the prophets have inquired and searched diligently,

476
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,179
who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you.

477
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,700
So you remember the apostle Paul

478
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,220
in 2 Corinthians chapter number three,

479
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,100
he talked about the law and he talked about

480
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,380
how the letter, it killeth, and he talked about

481
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,780
that old way and for so many generations,

482
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,619
they were.

483
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,259
in that way, and that's how they lived,

484
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,499
that's what they understood,

485
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:06,619
and now Peter is speaking of, as Paul revealed

486
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,259
in 2 Corinthians chapter three,

487
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,219
that we have now this new and living way

488
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,219
as we read in Hebrews chapter 10,

489
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:14,979
and we find that he says here,

490
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,939
Peter says that these prophets,

491
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:18,779
and we can read of the prophets of old,

492
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,019
and we can understand,

493
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,499
and it says that they prophesied of the grace

494
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,539
that should come unto you.

495
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,839
Can I report to you this morning, it has come.

496
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,519
They prophesied of the grace that should come,

497
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,159
but it has come.

498
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,559
And what a joy that is, notice verse 11,

499
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,199
searching what, or what manner of time

500
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,799
the Spirit of Christ which was in them

501
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,479
did signify when it testified beforehand

502
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:49,479
the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.

503
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,059
Verse 12, unto whom it was revealed

504
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,359
that not unto themselves, but unto us,

505
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,679
they did minister the things

506
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,719
which are now reported unto you

507
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:02,079
by them that have preached the gospel unto you

508
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,719
with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven,

509
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,999
and then notice this phrase,

510
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,919
which things the angels desire to look into.

511
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,079
This ministry that we have been given is unique.

512
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,719
There's a great privilege.

513
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,999
The Old Testament prophets, they prophesied of it.

514
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,359
Of course, we understand that we've been given

515
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,919
and we've been delivered just as Paul received,

516
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,319
we too have received this ministry,

517
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,719
and here Peter speaks about the glory that should follow,

518
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,079
of course, speaking of the resurrection

519
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,519
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

520
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,039
and then he talks about the fact

521
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,519
that we have the privilege of preaching the gospel,

522
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,479
yes, being filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

523
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,299
and then he says,

524
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,959
which things the angels desire to look into.

525
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,039
You know, there's not an angel

526
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,679
that can preach the gospel today.

527
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,279
There's not an angel that can preach the gospel today.

528
00:31:56,719 --> 00:32:01,439
A celestial angel, they cannot preach the gospel today.

529
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:05,399
They diligently look into it, inquiring.

530
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,720
See, they've not been saved like we've been saved.

531
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,279
They had a point in history where they could choose,

532
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,559
we understand the fallen angels

533
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,279
versus the faithful angels,

534
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,360
and we understand and we could speak.

535
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,559
The message this morning is not on angels specifically,

536
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,440
but I want you to understand this morning

537
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,799
that we've been saved by the grace of God,

538
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,000
and we've been given this ministry,

539
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,239
and we must recognize what God has entrusted to us

540
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:36,879
and the uniqueness of what God has given to us.

541
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,440
We notice all of these things

542
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,679
that Paul recognized, number two this morning.

543
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,659
I want you to notice how Paul responds.

544
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,440
How would we respond after recognizing

545
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,039
such wonderful truth?

546
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,679
I believe that Paul responds exactly

547
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,159
how I would expect him to respond

548
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,199
after sharing all of these wonderful truths,

549
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:03,080
after understanding that he had been blinded by the enemy,

550
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,679
but he experienced the power and glory of the gospel.

551
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,799
He knew what Christ did for him,

552
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,779
and he wanted to publish the gospel

553
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,159
to as many as he possibly could.

554
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,199
So how is it that Paul responded?

555
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,759
Well, right there in the middle of the text

556
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,119
in 2 Corinthians 4, we find in verse number five,

557
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,119
notice he says, for we preach not ourselves,

558
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,279
but Christ Jesus the Lord,

559
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,759
and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

560
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,759
You know what he did?

561
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,360
He preached Christ.

562
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,279
He preached Christ.

563
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:39,159
We find that Paul had this great desire.

564
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,559
We've read already in Romans 1

565
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,259
how Paul said he was deader, he was ready,

566
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,479
he was not ashamed,

567
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,039
and Paul wanted to, he desired to preach

568
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,119
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

569
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,959
Why?

570
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,199
Because he knew what it did for him.

571
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,839
Do you know if you study the book of Acts

572
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,039
and you trace the steps of the apostle Paul,

573
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
you can say with assurance

574
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,379
that Paul never got over his salvation.

575
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:13,159
Acts chapter number nine records the conversion of Paul.

576
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,100
He was saw, but you find that at various moments of time

577
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,579
when he's standing before dignitaries,

578
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:26,699
standing before these powerful individuals,

579
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,419
what does he do?

580
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:32,059
He gives his testimony of what Christ did for him

581
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,260
and how he'd been saved by the grace of God.

582
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,359
He never got over it.

583
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,299
The apostle Paul was burdened

584
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,760
because of what he recognized to be true,

585
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,940
because of these seven things that he outlines here

586
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,079
in 2 Corinthians 4, and we too must be burdened.

587
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:51,299
We must respond in like manner that we too would say,

588
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,339
we preach Christ, that that is our purpose.

589
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,139
Why is it that God left us here?

590
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,019
Why is it?

591
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:59,019
I know sometimes we mention that, man,

592
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,919
it'd be wonderful at the moment of salvation

593
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,179
if we were just immediately transported to heaven

594
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:05,339
and we didn't have to deal with all of these things here,

595
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,459
but the reality is that God in his wonderful wisdom

596
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:13,279
and his master plan, he left us here

597
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,559
ultimately for the purpose of bringing glory to his name,

598
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,839
and John 15 plainly tells us that when we bear fruit,

599
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,359
we bring glory to his name.

600
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,559
How will they hear?

601
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:28,600
Romans 10 answers that question.

602
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,160
They will not hear without a preacher,

603
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,760
someone to tell them.

604
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,479
In Acts chapter 20, you don't need to turn there,

605
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,320
in verse 31, Paul says,

606
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,579
therefore watch and remember that by the space

607
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,220
of three years, I cease not to warn everyone

608
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,619
night and day with tears.

609
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,380
Why was Paul so consumed with this idea

610
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,579
of preaching the gospel?

611
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,579
Why was he so just completely given to sharing the gospel?

612
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,579
I mean, you go to town after town, city after city,

613
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:03,979
opportunity after opportunity, and Paul does what?

614
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:05,459
He preaches the gospel.

615
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,660
He preaches the gospel.

616
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,660
In Romans chapter 15, in verse number 19,

617
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,540
he says, through mighty signs and wonders

618
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,100
by the power of the spirit of God,

619
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,059
so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Eliukim,

620
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,179
I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

621
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,100
I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

622
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,019
Reminded of what Paul says to this group of believers

623
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,940
in Corinth in 1 Corinthians one, in verse 23,

624
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,979
he says, but we preach Christ crucified.

625
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:36,260
We preach Christ.

626
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,440
We preach Christ.

627
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,359
This morning, do we recognize these things

628
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,399
that Paul recognized about the ministry

629
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,160
that has been given to us?

630
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,679
Do we recognize the responsibility, the privilege,

631
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,959
the enabling, the seriousness, the purpose,

632
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,959
the opposition, and the joy?

633
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:03,359
I think that if we recognize those things,

634
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,899
it will help us to respond in like manner.

635
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:11,739
That we will have the kind of burden that Paul has

636
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:15,380
that he shares in Romans nine and in Romans 10,

637
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,779
that his heart's desire and prayer for Israel

638
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,179
is that they might be saved,

639
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:21,100
his kinsmen according to the flesh,

640
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,779
that he just desired that people would be saved.

641
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,619
Let me finish this morning with a verse

642
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,019
that will come later in the book

643
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,059
of 2 Corinthians chapter 10.

644
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,160
Notice in 2 Corinthians chapter 10,

645
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,559
Paul goes through a number of things here

646
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,040
as he's wrapping up, getting near the end of this book,

647
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,600
but I want you to notice what he says.

648
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,919
In verse 15, it says, not boasting of things

649
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:57,479
without our measure, that is, of other men's labors,

650
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:00,079
but having hope when your faith is increased

651
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,699
that we shall be enlarged by you

652
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:04,899
according to our rule abundantly.

653
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,419
And then notice what he says in verse 16,

654
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:11,179
to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you,

655
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,040
and not to boast in another man's line

656
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,619
of things made ready to our hand,

657
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:17,619
but he that glorieth, let him glory, what?

658
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:19,940
Let him glory in the Lord.

659
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,940
I want you to notice it says to preach the gospel

660
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,540
in the regions beyond you.

661
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:27,260
We see it in Thessalonica that from them

662
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,179
sounded forth the word of God.

663
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,059
Through Macedonia and Achaia

664
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,900
and how they heard the truth of the gospel.

665
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,260
And for us this morning that we'd understand

666
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:42,020
and recognize what God has given to us

667
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,539
and that we would respond by saying,

668
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,539
God, would you just use me?

669
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:49,859
It may not be that God will call you

670
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,179
to go to some foreign field.

671
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,859
It may not be that God would call you

672
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,380
to be a pastor of some church,

673
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,020
but it is true that God says that of every child of God

674
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,279
that we are his witnesses, that we are his ambassadors,

675
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,239
that we are his representatives,

676
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,919
that we are to preach the gospel to every creature.

677
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:13,960
And every Christian is a preacher of the gospel.

678
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,200
And then we'd say, God, would you use me?

679
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,539
Would you help me to respond simply by surrendering?

680
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,320
God, use me.

681
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,979
I know what you did for me.

682
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,760
I've experienced the power of the gospel personally.

683
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,239
And God, I want you to use me.

684
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:37,239
I desire that you would use me as a vessel

685
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,960
because we have this treasure in earthen vessels.

686
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,359
God, help me to be surrendered

687
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,599
and that you would take the gospel

688
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,279
of the Lord Jesus Christ and save sinners.

689
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:55,080
Just use us, God, for your glory.

690
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,919
Let's pray.

691
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,039
Father, we love you.

692
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,279
We thank you for loving us.

693
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,619
We thank you, God, for.

694
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:06,119
what Paul outlined here in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God. We thank you God

695
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:13,579
for the power of the Gospel. Thank you for saving me. Lord, so many that are here this

696
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:18,379
morning that have shared personally with me their testimony of salvation and how thankful

697
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:22,979
we are. And I just pray, Lord, this morning that you help us to recognize these important

698
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:30,359
truths from 2 Corinthians chapter 4. You'd help us to respond in like manner as the Apostle

699
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,339
Paul responded that we preach Christ. God, you would just use us. That we'd recognize

700
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:43,419
that we have this treasure in earthen vessels. So often we may look at ourselves and say,

701
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:51,499
who am I? What do I have to offer? I'm not a, we have a treasure in earthen vessels.

702
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:59,499
The Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you for your plan. And I pray that you'd help

703
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,699
us to surrender and submit. And we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would

704
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:07,019
you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd

705
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:09,619
love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your home.
