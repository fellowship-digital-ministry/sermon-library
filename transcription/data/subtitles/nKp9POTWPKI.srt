1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And we were in the Old Testament and this morning back to our study through the book of 1st Timothy.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And our theme for this calendar year is continue.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We find that in 1st and 2nd Timothy we see many references to the idea of continue.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the Apostle Paul is being used of the Lord to write to his son in the faith, Timothy,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and to encourage him to continue, to continue to do the work of the ministry,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to continue to do what God's called him to do.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And what a blessing.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm thankful that God gives us the strength and he gives us the truth that we need

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in order to continue to endure.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Listen, we'll face opposition, we'll face adversity,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but with God's help and by God's grace we can continue to do what God has called us to do.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
As we look this morning in 1st Timothy chapter 4,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I plan to preach through the entire chapter, the 16 verses here.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to read just a couple of verses and we'll get right into it this morning.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In verse number 1, notice the Bible says,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The nature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but sanctified by the word of God in prayer.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Notice verse 6,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If thou, Timothy, if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
whereunto thou hast attained.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want you to look at verse 16.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's actually our memory verse for the month of May if you've been working on it.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Bible says,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
As we look at this passage of Scripture,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've titled the message this morning this,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How is your diet?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How is your diet?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you look at verse number 6,

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the Bible says right in the middle of that verse,

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that we'll be nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As you note the title for the message this morning,

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you may immediately think of your physical diet,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and you might think of its nutrition level.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
However, this is church, and I'm not a dietician.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Amen.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Praise the Lord for that.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm a pastor.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
God's given me the responsibility of preaching the word of God,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and we find that God's word,

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and here in this text of Scripture,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
when I ask how is your diet,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not referring to your physical diet.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm referring to your spiritual diet.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
God likens his word to food,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and our text, as I've read already twice now in verse number 6,

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
speaks about being nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
1 Peter 2 and verse number 2 says,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word,

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that ye may grow thereby.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We understand that as God would liken his word to food,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and even in that truth in 1 Peter 2,

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
he gives the understanding as newborn babes,

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
if you're saved this morning,

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
praise God for your salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you're not saved this morning,

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you don't know that heaven is your home.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Today is the day of salvation.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It could be the day of your second birth.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We find that those that are born again,

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
we are babes in Christ.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You grow in your Christian life.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've now had the privilege of knowing the Lord

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and walking with the Lord for some 20, almost 7 years,

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and I praise the Lord for that.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And the reality is that when I first got saved,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and when you first got saved, you were a babe.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I hope you're not still a babe, amen,

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
unless you just got saved recently.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why?

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because we're to grow in grace and knowledge

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And he says in 1 Peter 2,

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
As newborn babes desire what?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The sincere milk of the word,

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that ye may grow thereby.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You know what babies need?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They need milk.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And he refers to the milk of the word,

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but we find that in Hebrews 5 and verse 14,

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
God says this,

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
even those who by reason of use

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm thankful that there's the milk of the word,

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but I'm thankful that there's the meat of the word.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know, the more you, the longer you have been saved,

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and the more you read the Bible,

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and the closer you get to the Lord,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the more you find out how deep this book really is,

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and the treasures within God's word,

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and I'm so thankful for it.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As we think this morning about this question

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that I've used to title the message this morning,

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
How is your diet?

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
As we look at this passage of scripture,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
we see that there's some things that we ought to receive,

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but there's some things that we ought to reject.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And we understand that as we look at this passage of scripture,

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
there's a continuity that is given throughout this portion

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
of God's word that helps us understand

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the importance of our spiritual diet.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's very interesting to me that when this book was written,

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
of course, in the first century,

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the technology that is available today

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
was obviously not available then.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And even as the Apostle Paul would be used of God

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to give this instruction and to provide this warning,

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and to help the people,

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Timothy and those that he's ministering to in Ephesus,

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to understand the importance of receiving certain things

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but rejecting other things,

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
how much more today we need the truth

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
of this portion of scripture.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm thankful this morning that God's word is perfect,

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it's preserved.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm thankful that it's profitable.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm thankful that it is a book

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that just goes beyond our ability

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to fully understand the depths of the truth of this book

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the fact that it does not need to be updated.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No, we just need to follow the instruction

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that God has given us.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a book that's been given for every people

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
throughout all of time because its author is eternal.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And what a blessing to understand that truth

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and to comprehend it this morning.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And so if we're taking notes this morning,

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
we ask the question, how is your diet?

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm going to give you a couple of thoughts.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Number one, you must be selective.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You must be selective.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What do I mean by that?

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, not everything that is available

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is to be consumed by the child of God.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Just because something is available,

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
just because something has a Christian title

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
doesn't mean that it should be consumed

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
by the child of God.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Understand this morning that there are many books,

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that there are many pamphlets,

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that there are blogs and videos,

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and you think about the YouTube videos

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
that are available today,

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and you look at all the blogs,

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and I mean just so many things that are available

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that would have a Christian title to them

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that may have some catchphrases in them

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that may at first appearance look to be

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
something that you could consume.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But I want you to understand this morning

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that not everything that is available

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is to be consumed by the child of God.

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Not everything that's available

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is to be consumed by the child of God.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
See, there are some things that are unhealthy.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are some things that are unhealthy.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Notice what the Bible says in verse 1.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It says,

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Notice what it says,

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that in the latter times,

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
some shall depart from the faith,

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and they're giving heed to seducing spirits.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Understand that we're engaged in spiritual warfare,

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
spiritual battle.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Listen, it is Satan, the enemy of God,

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the enemy of God's people,

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that said in Genesis chapter number 3,

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yea, hath God said.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's the enemy, Satan, that in Genesis 3 says,

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ye shall not surely die.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And he continues to manipulate God's word,

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and he continues to cause doubt and confusion,

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and these demons, these fallen angels,

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
these false spirits,

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
we find that it says,

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
giving heed to seducing spirits.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Notice, and doctrines of devils.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It says this in verse 2,

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Speaking lies and hypocrisy,

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
having their conscience seared with a hot iron,

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
forbidding to marry,

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and commanding to abstain from meats,

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
of them which believe and know the truth.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And so we find that there's a warning that's given.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There's a couple of examples in verse number 3

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
of what these false teachers would teach

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and this danger that is lurking.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We find that in verse number 7,

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we speak about that which is unhealthy.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Notice what God says in verse 7,

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But refuse profane and old wives' fables,

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
As we begin to think about that which is unhealthy,

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
see, the appearance of something doesn't determine

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
whether it's healthy or unhealthy.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In fact, there are many books that can be written

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that have really nice graphics,

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and I mean appealing titles,

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and yet the content is not healthy for God's people.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There are those, listen, you understand

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
that the people that are false teachers

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that are following what we see here,

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that we as God's people are to refuse and to reject,

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
they do not begin their blog,

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
they do not begin their video by saying,

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
by the way, I'm speaking...

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,539
They're making lies and hypocrisy just to put it out there.

214
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,179
They don't start out that way.

215
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,020
No, they're deceptive, they're crafty,

216
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,520
they're seeking to lead astray

217
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,619
with craftiness and deceitfulness,

218
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:19,620
and we find this morning that we must be selective

219
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,959
because there are some things that are unhealthy.

220
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,659
In 1 Timothy chapter number one,

221
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,000
turn back a couple of pages,

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,600
and I want to remind you of what God revealed

223
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,000
in this first chapter that we studied many weeks ago now,

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,639
and we find that in verse number four,

225
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,580
notice what God says.

226
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,479
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.

227
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:44,680
Notice what they do, which minister questions

228
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,860
rather than godly edifying, which is in faith, so do.

229
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,400
So they minister questions, they give this doubt.

230
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,560
They cause people to say, well, yeah, how could that be?

231
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,740
Listen, God says that he is a god of the impossible.

232
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,639
God is the one that created everything.

233
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,580
He is the one that sustains everything.

234
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,940
We must understand that as we look at the pages

235
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,779
of this book, and we'll mention some more about this

236
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,860
in just a moment, that God's word is powerful,

237
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,459
and it is truthful, and everything that it records

238
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
is accurate.

239
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,660
You say, well, I just don't understand how that could be.

240
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,819
It goes against the laws of he created.

241
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,160
He is God, amen?

242
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,860
And so guess what happens in a lot of these videos

243
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,040
and these blogs and these books, they minister questions.

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,379
They simply try to put a little doubt

245
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,639
in the mind of a believer, in the mind of an individual

246
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,779
that will destroy their entire understanding

247
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,839
and cause them to have no confidence whatsoever

248
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,739
in this precious book.

249
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,540
Why is there so much attack in Genesis one through 11?

250
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,319
Why are there so many that have attacked

251
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,480
the creation account, the flood account?

252
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,660
Why constant bombardment on those particular passage

253
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,919
of scripture?

254
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,100
Well, because if you can undermine, if you can discredit,

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,160
if you can discredit the first several chapters

256
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,759
of the book of Genesis, you've destroyed

257
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,800
the entirety of the Bible.

258
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,539
Because if God can't be trusted in what he said

259
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,440
in Genesis one, and what he said in Genesis two,

260
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,240
and what he said in Genesis three, and four, and five,

261
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,880
and six, and so on and so forth,

262
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,539
then how can we trust John 3.16?

263
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Oh, but we want to trust John 3.16,

264
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
because for God so loved the world that he gave his own,

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,639
and if you don't believe that verse, sure you do.

266
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,639
But you can't have a redeemer without a creator.

267
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,880
He is creator, and he is redeemer.

268
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,479
And we rejoice in that.

269
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,419
Listen, there are some things that are unhealthy.

270
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,020
There are some things that the child of God

271
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,559
must simply refuse.

272
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,820
They must reject.

273
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,800
Let me say, I'm not gonna read that,

274
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,199
I'm not gonna watch that, I'm not gonna be influenced

275
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,199
by that, why?

276
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,460
Because it's unhealthy.

277
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,500
It's not good for me.

278
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,199
God said, without faith, it is impossible to please him.

279
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,419
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

280
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:26,580
and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,

281
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,720
in Hebrews 11, in verse number six.

282
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,059
Listen, we believe this book by faith.

283
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,919
Someone said, you mean to tell me that you believe

284
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,259
a whale swallowed Jonah?

285
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,660
Yeah.

286
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,300
And a preacher said this in response,

287
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,339
if God's word told me that a Jonah swallowed a whale,

288
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,339
I'd believe it, too.

289
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,160
Amen?

290
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:45,820
Why?

291
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,460
Because God's word is truth.

292
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,820
God's word is truth.

293
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,419
There's some things that are unhealthy.

294
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,979
In 1 Timothy 1, 4, we see how it ministers questions.

295
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:56,619
Notice in verse six, the Bible says,

296
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,960
from which some having swerved,

297
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,059
notice this, have turned aside unto vain jangling.

298
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,139
I love the way that that phrase is recorded for us

299
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,500
and really translated for us.

300
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,080
And it has this idea of useless talk.

301
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,059
Sometimes you listen to these,

302
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,260
and I hope you're not listening to them,

303
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,980
but you come across something,

304
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,660
and it's just vain jangling.

305
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
It's just useless talk.

306
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,920
It's just ministering questions.

307
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,820
It's not edifying.

308
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,660
It's not building up.

309
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,980
It's not honoring God.

310
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,980
It's not building up your faith.

311
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,660
We find that there's some things, again,

312
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,040
that we as God's people must simply refuse.

313
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,220
We must be selective.

314
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,059
Why?

315
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,380
Because there's some things that are unhealthy.

316
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,380
We must be selective.

317
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,200
Why?

318
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,859
Because there's some things that are healthy.

319
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm thankful for God's word.

320
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,359
I'm thankful for resources that are available

321
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,079
that are helpful, that are healthful,

322
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,000
that God uses to build up our faith.

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,279
Notice the Bible says, we read already in verse number three,

324
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,480
notice the end of the verse.

325
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,000
The Bible says, to be received with thanksgiving,

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
notice this, of them which believe and know the truth.

327
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,459
I'm so thankful for truth.

328
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:14,459
We live in a world today that really, in many cases,

329
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
they don't want to know truth.

330
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,000
They don't want to be confronted with truth.

331
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,739
They don't want to acknowledge that God is who he is

332
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:28,559
and that he's given a Bible that is truth

333
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,279
because if they acknowledge that,

334
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,260
then they're accountable to that.

335
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,160
And so man wants to, quote unquote, create their own truth.

336
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
They want to say, well, that's your truth.

337
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,459
This is my truth and everything becomes relative.

338
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,179
But what I would submit to you this morning

339
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:48,100
is that there is truth and it is absolute truth.

340
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,899
Jesus, who is the way, the truth and the life,

341
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,899
stood before Pilate and Pilate says what is truth,

342
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,320
but he didn't stick around long enough to get an answer.

343
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,660
And how sad that is.

344
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,779
Jesus said, before he went,

345
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,700
before that interaction with Pilate,

346
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,059
he says this, sanctify them by thy word.

347
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,140
Thy word is truth.

348
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,480
Truth stands on its own.

349
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,459
Truth is powerful.

350
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,160
It's transforming.

351
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm so thankful for truth.

352
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,720
And he says to those that know the truth,

353
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,000
that believe and know the truth,

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
what is the truth reference?

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
Well, he talks about that they forbid to marry

356
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,359
and command to abstain from meats.

357
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,920
But what is the truth knowing in verse number four,

358
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
for every creature of God is good

359
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,500
and nothing to be refused

360
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,220
if it be received with thanksgiving.

361
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,260
Hallelujah.

362
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,700
Praise God.

363
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,540
Amen.

364
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,600
You know, there've been some dietary restriction changes

365
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,299
throughout the scriptures.

366
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,940
You think about pre in the garden

367
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,140
and then you think about pre flood

368
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,260
and then you think about post flood

369
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,820
and then you think about the dietary restriction

370
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,739
in the book of Leviticus.

371
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:58,059
And then you come to the New Testament

372
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,500
and God says that everything

373
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,059
can be received with thanksgiving.

374
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,059
Hallelujah.

375
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,820
Glory to God.

376
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,679
For it is sanctified by the word of God in prayer.

377
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,839
But then notice this,

378
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,040
as we think about that which is healthy

379
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,559
and we understand what it does for us

380
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,760
and how it encourages and edifies and builds us.

381
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,220
In verse number six, notice what the Bible says.

382
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,579
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

383
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,420
what things?

384
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,500
Well, obviously he's not returning

385
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,119
to the doctrines of devils in verse number one.

386
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,720
He's not speaking about the lies

387
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,040
and hypocrisies of verse number two.

388
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,500
No, he's talking about the truth.

389
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,799
And if you, Timothy,

390
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,920
if you put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

391
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,320
in other words, as he will say in 2 Timothy 4,

392
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,600
preach the word.

393
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Timothy, if you're faithful to teach the truth,

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,640
if you're faithful to give the word of God,

395
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,000
notice that you put the brethren

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,720
in remembrance of these things.

397
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,220
Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

398
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,559
Thou shalt be the desire of every pastor,

399
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,200
every spiritual leader.

400
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,239
And it says, nourished up in the words of faith

401
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:16,160
and of good doctrine where unto thou hast attained.

402
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm thankful for the truth of God's word

403
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,519
and it continues to help us understand

404
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,559
that that which is healthy.

405
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
In verse seven, it says, but refuse,

406
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,359
again, that which is unhealthy,

407
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,899
profane and old wise fables.

408
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:32,739
But what do you do?

409
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,559
Rather, unto godliness.

410
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,520
For bodily exercise profiteth little.

411
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,799
But godliness is profitable unto all things,

412
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
having promise of the life that now is

413
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,000
and of that which is to come.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,479
Now, verse number eight's a very interesting

415
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,559
verse of scripture.

416
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,559
Bodily exercise profiteth little.

417
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,440
There's a truth there that it is profitable,

418
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,039
but it ought not be the primary concern.

419
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
You know, we live in a culture today

420
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,179
that puts a greater emphasis on the external

421
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,739
than they do on the spiritual,

422
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:08,919
on the physical versus the spiritual.

423
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,460
They spend hours in a gym trying to sculpt muscles

424
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,599
and whatever and have whatever type of health

425
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,599
they think they can have while they ignore the spiritual.

426
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,380
God is not saying in this verse of scripture

427
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,940
that you shouldn't exercise,

428
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,340
that you shouldn't have any bodily exercise.

429
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,460
He's simply helping us to understand

430
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,179
that bodily exercise profiteth little.

431
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:33,659
It's temporary.

432
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,239
Amen?

433
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:41,239
But, notice, godliness is profitable unto all things,

434
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,960
having promise of the life that now is

435
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,039
and of that which is to come.

436
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,239
And understanding this work of studying the scriptures,

437
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:53,000
of growing spiritually, of feasting upon that

438
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,280
which is healthy, of being in God's word.

439
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,919
Listen, I hope this morning that you don't spend

440
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,219
more time.

441
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:04,779
physically working out than you do spiritually feasting on God's Word.

442
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:10,539
There needs to be a balance. There needs to be a balance. Well, the doctor told me that I need to

443
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:11,219
exercise.

444
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:17,019
Well, listen, God says to study. God says that we're to read it and to know it and to

445
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,259
memorize it.

446
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,059
People say, man, I just can't memorize any verses. It's just too hard for me. You know

447
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,059
why, Ms. Lorraine? It takes work!

448
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:29,539
Right? She says to me, she's been a blessing all year. I don't mean to point her out, but

449
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,939
all year she's been a blessing with this memory verse campaign that we're doing of each month

450
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:35,579
having a verse as a church.

451
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,779
She comes to me and she's called me and said, can I quote the verse to you? She comes in

452
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,219
and says, can I quote the verse to you? At scripture assembly, she says, I'm going to

453
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:47,619
start in January and I'm going to give, and just help me with the first word and we'd

454
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:54,619
get through it. And man, that's a blessing to my heart. But why? It's work. It's work.

455
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,979
It's work.

456
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:02,099
She says this in verse 9, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. For

457
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:06,899
therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living God who is

458
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,979
the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe.

459
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:14,299
Now this verse, verse number 10, is a unique verse, a great verse. You know, there's a

460
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:21,299
teaching of election and predestination and Calvinistic ideas that there's only, Jesus

461
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:25,219
only died for certain people and so on and so forth. Well here we find that the Bible

462
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,219
promises that He's the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe. What does

463
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:33,179
He mean by that? Well obviously we know that all men aren't saved, but His sacrifice and

464
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:40,179
His payment for sin is enough, is sufficient for all of humanity. Praise God. Hallelujah

465
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,899
for that truth.

466
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:49,159
We find that earlier Paul had said this in verse number 15 of chapter 1, this is a faithful

467
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,319
saying and worthy of all acceptation. What is it? That Christ Jesus came into the world

468
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:58,279
to save sinners, of whom I am chief. But how many are sinners? For all have sinned

469
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,919
and come short of the glory of God. And He came into the world to save sinners. His payment,

470
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,759
His blood was sufficient, it's satisfied, and it's available to all mankind. The Bible

471
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,479
says this, that the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, speaking about His return as

472
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:20,059
some men count slackness, but is longsuffering to us, word, not willing that any should perish

473
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,739
but that all should come to repentance. Calvinists have a hard time getting around the word any

474
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:28,579
and all. They start redefining terms and they start manipulating scripture and so on and

475
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,619
so forth. And I love taking them to 1 John chapter 2 where the Bible says that we know

476
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:38,099
that He is the propitiation for our sins, hallelujah, He's writing to save people, but

477
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:45,099
not for our sins, only for the sins of the whole world. Hallelujah. In fact, God speaks

478
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,979
about false teachers and says that they deny the truth, they deny the one that died for

479
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:58,979
them, that paid for their sin. These verses reveal to us that the child of God must be

480
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,339
selective. There are things that are unhealthy, things that are healthy. So we understand

481
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,579
that physically speaking. There are some things that are unhealthy for you. You say, but they

482
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:20,579
taste so good. Listen, the devil's crafty. He'll make it sound good. He'll make it look

483
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:31,099
good. But it's unhealthy. It's unhealthy. There might be some things you need to cut

484
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:35,299
out of your diet. There might be some things that you say, well, I can handle it. No, you

485
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:42,299
can't. You can't. It starts messing with your brain. It causes doubt, confusion, uncertainty,

486
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:50,979
all of a sudden you're not believing what God has said. See, we talked about that which

487
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:56,179
is unhealthy and how it ministers questions, and it's referred to as being vain, jangling,

488
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:00,979
useless talk. Well, that which is healthy, it will build you up. Notice what the Bible

489
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:05,179
says in the book of Colossians. Turn over quickly, if you will, to Colossians chapter

490
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:12,179
number 2. In Colossians chapter 2, in verse number 6, the Bible says that the devil's

491
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:19,619
purpose is this, is he have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.

492
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:26,619
And then notice this, rooted and built up in him, established in the faith, as he have

493
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:34,459
been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. But you know, it's followed with another warning.

494
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:42,579
But, in verse 8, beware, lest any man spoil you, how, through philosophy and vain deceit,

495
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:49,899
after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. That which

496
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:55,819
is healthy is going to build you up. That which is healthy will give maturity and stability.

497
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:01,419
Turn back to the book of Ephesians, if you will, and look at the fourth chapter, Ephesians

498
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,979
chapter number 4, because that which is healthy is going to build you up. That which is healthy

499
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:10,819
is going to give maturity and stability. Again, we understand some of these principles when

500
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:15,779
we think about a physical diet. We're speaking this morning about a spiritual diet. I want

501
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:21,779
to be built up. I want to have that spiritual maturity. I want to have that spiritual stability.

502
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,099
It's only going to come as a result of having, being selective and having a healthy spiritual

503
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:33,419
diet. In verse number 14 of Ephesians 4, the Bible says that we, henceforth be no more

504
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,859
children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight

505
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:46,059
of men and cunning craftiness, notice this, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. But speaking

506
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:53,059
the truth in love may grow up into him in all things, which is the head even Christ.

507
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:59,059
Listen, you want to have that stability? You want to have that maturity? You've got to

508
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,939
be selective in your spiritual diet. There's some things that you ought to receive. There's

509
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,739
some things that you ought to reject, you ought to refuse. You say, listen, I'm going

510
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:14,339
to be selective with my spiritual diet. I understand that not everything that is available

511
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:21,339
is to be consumed by the child of God. We must examine the source. Examine the source.

512
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,139
Listen, you ought to know the author. You ought to know some things about what the author

513
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:30,859
believes. You ought to know who's putting the videos out there and what they believe.

514
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:35,619
And listen, say, well, I can believe, you know, we believe certain things that are consistent.

515
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:41,259
Be careful, because sooner or later what's going to happen, you start filling, you continue

516
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,979
to fill your mind with those things, it's going to have an impact. It's going to have

517
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:49,979
an influence. You say, well, if I believe this that they said, they were so convincing

518
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:54,499
in what they said over here, and I didn't believe it when I first started. But now all

519
00:26:54,499 --> 00:27:00,659
of a sudden I understand where they're coming from. Be careful. We must examine the source.

520
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,499
We must know. Listen, what do they believe? If they don't believe in creation, if they

521
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:11,059
don't believe that God is the creator, if they don't believe that He died for all people,

522
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,499
if they don't believe that Jesus is the only way to heaven, if they don't believe, we could

523
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:19,399
just keep going through the fundamentals of the faith. Listen, don't fill your mind with

524
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:26,399
it. It ministers questions. It's vain jangling. We find this morning that Paul says to Timothy

525
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:36,519
in the second letter, we're not going to turn there and look at it, but you can reference

526
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:42,599
it in 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 10, Paul makes this statement, but thou has fully known

527
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,799
my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, and patience. I like

528
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:55,559
that he says, you have fully known my doctrine and manner of life. You ought to examine the

529
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:00,319
source. You know how many people today, when we talk about physical diet, are looking at

530
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,239
the labels? I mean, they're examining, they want to know where did this thing come from,

531
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:09,919
what's going on with it, what's the source? Why? Because they want to, I only want to

532
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,079
put healthy things in my body. And then they're a Christian and they go and listen to terrible

533
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,959
false teaching. You say, what's going on here? You examine the source with regard to

534
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:22,679
the meat that you're going to eat, but you don't even care about the stuff you're listening

535
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:32,399
to? It's dangerous. And Paul gives a warning. He says we have to be selective. When it comes

536
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,319
to our spiritual diet, when we ask ourselves how's our diet spiritually speaking, we must

537
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,559
be selective. Number two, I took a long time on number one, but we'll get through it. Amen.

538
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:50,079
Number two, you must, you must be scriptural. You must be selective, but you must be scriptural.

539
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:59,639
See, in verse number three of the Bible says, them which believe and know the truth. I've

540
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:04,719
already made mention of the fact that we're thankful for God's truth, for God's Word,

541
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:10,879
but I want you to understand this morning that this Bible is like no other book. God's

542
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:18,959
Word is like no other book. This book, the Bible, we must refuse reading it like we would

543
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:25,399
read any other book, because it's not like any other book. It's unique in the fact that

544
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:34,479
its author is divine, its content is true. We accept it by faith. God said it, that settles

545
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:40,119
it. So often we've read and we've seen, and I know that bumper stickers aren't quite as

546
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,319
common or popular today as they once were, but you'll remember perhaps, those of you

547
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,079
that are old enough, the bumper sticker or maybe today the meme that says, God said it,

548
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,879
I believe it, that settles it. I submit to you this morning that whether you believe

549
00:29:54,879 --> 00:30:01,879
it or not doesn't really matter, because if God said it, that settles it.

550
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:11,639
that settles it. Amen? I think about the disciples in Acts when the

551
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:15,359
religious leaders are fighting against and Gamaliel stands up and says, listen,

552
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,299
if this thing be of God and you try to fight against him, it's like you're

553
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:23,639
fighting against God. Yeah, that's exactly what you're doing. Listen, God gave us a

554
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:28,399
perfect book. He gave us a pure book that is preserved, that is precious, that is

555
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,359
profitable, that is powerful, a book that we have in our hands this morning that

556
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,959
is like no other book. Listen, I have books in my library that you can have. I

557
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:47,559
don't care, but you can't have my Bible. You can't have my Bible. My kids could tell you

558
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:53,879
they're older now. When they were little, still they don't carry my Bible. Could

559
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,759
they? Yeah, they're old enough, they're big enough, but when they're little kids, man,

560
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,799
they didn't carry my Bible. You say, well, that's kind of, listen, I was, I didn't

561
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,999
want them dropping it and drawing in it. I came home from work one day. I was

562
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:07,199
working at Sikorsky and Juliana got a hold of a page in Exodus and wrote all

563
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:13,319
over it. Man, I had to go take a break. I was like, whew, I gotta calm down for a minute, right? I was

564
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,279
at a pastor's meeting on Tuesday. I tell you the truth, I'm protective about my

565
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,999
Bible. I was at a pastor's meeting on Tuesday and I left my Bible in the pew

566
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,399
of the church. Why did I leave it in the pew? Because we're going over to have

567
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:29,719
lunch and guess what? I don't want anything spilling on my Bible. Because

568
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:33,839
I'm messy and I'm gonna spill? No, the guy next to me might spill something. Amen?

569
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,239
There might be a kid at the table. I leave my Bible in the church so I know

570
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:42,079
where I left it. I know where it is. It's in safekeeping and I'm there and I'm

571
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,479
fellowship and I'm getting ready to leave and I'm talking to Pastor Mike

572
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,759
Reed. I'm talking to him and some lady comes walking through. Anyone know whose

573
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,639
Bible this is? I'm like, whoa, that's my Bible. Careful. And she's like, oh, I just

574
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,799
wanted to bring it to you. And I'm like, thank you very much. Just trying to, just

575
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,319
wagging it around, right? Listen, the Bible is a precious book. You say, Pastor, you're

576
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:10,759
gonna get a new one. I understand but it's my Bible. It's my Bible. I love the

577
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:20,279
Bible. I love the Bible. This book is like no other book. It has absolutely changed

578
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:28,639
my life. And those of you here this morning that have read this book, you

579
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:33,519
know that this book is like no other book. You know the impact and the

580
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,359
difference that this book has made in your life. I'm reading through the Bible

581
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,759
for a second time right now. I personally like to read in Genesis and go through

582
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,199
Revelation and start back in Genesis and go to Revelation and start back. That's

583
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:52,999
just what I like to do. Near the end of the year, depending on what the time of

584
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:57,879
the month is when I finish Revelation for a, whatever the time is that I

585
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,679
finish it in that calendar year, depending on the number of days or

586
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:04,959
months left in the year, I might just read the New Testament and then I'll

587
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:10,439
start on January 1st in Genesis 1. It's just what I do. The last few days I've

588
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:20,199
been reading Leviticus. Right now I'm reading Deuteronomy. It's exciting. I know

589
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:24,079
that numbers is in between those two books. I understand that. But I bring up

590
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:30,959
Leviticus because so many people criticize the book of Leviticus. Let me

591
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:35,079
give you just a moment of insight with regard to the book of Leviticus. The book

592
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,159
of Exodus is exciting because it records for us how God delivered His people out

593
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,439
of Egyptian bondage. And it's exciting to read the book of Exodus. I had regularly,

594
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:51,359
I admit that. I willingly admit that the book of Exodus is exciting. I mean, you

595
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,959
start reading about the Red Sea, you read about all the plagues, you read about the Red Sea,

596
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:59,679
man, it's exciting. You end the book with the tabernacle being reared up and the

597
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,759
presence of God being there. I mean, it's exciting. You come to the book of Leviticus, you start

598
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:11,119
reading all this stuff. You say, what in the world is going on here? Two quick takeaways.

599
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,839
Number one, Moses was a faithful minister. God gave Moses truth for the people and Moses

600
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,359
delivered the truth to the people. But let me tell you what the book of Leviticus is really

601
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,719
all about. See, God got His people out of Egypt. But in the book of Leviticus, God has to get

602
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:36,839
Egypt out of His people. And for those of us that are saved here this morning, I don't know

603
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:42,439
when you got saved, but Egypt is a type of picture of the world. And I don't know how much world you

604
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:47,479
had in you before you got saved. But you know what Christ is trying to do? He's trying to get the

605
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:54,959
world out of you. You know what He says? Be holy for I am holy. We're in the book of Leviticus. He

606
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,159
says, here's what I want you to do. Here's how I want you to behave. I don't want you to do what

607
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:02,519
you saw in Egypt. I don't want you to do what you're going to see in the land. I want you to

608
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:10,279
do what I'm telling you to do because I'm your God. Don't skip it. It's powerful. It's helpful.

609
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:15,399
By the way, the Old Testament was written for two things according to the New Testament. Number one,

610
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:23,319
our learning. Number two, our admonition. The Bible is one complete book that's made up of

611
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:32,199
66 individual books, but its theme is consistent, written over a period of 1,500 years, 40 different

612
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:38,319
people. I mean, it's amazing. Why? Because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God. It's

613
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:45,959
God's Word. It's God's book. And we understand this morning that we should not, we must not

614
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:52,039
consume that which deviates from the Bible. We must remember that there are some things that must

615
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:59,239
be refused. John says this in 1 John chapter number 4 and verse number 1, Beloved, believe not

616
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:05,399
every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out

617
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:16,479
into the world. This morning, we must be selective, but we must be scriptural. Where God's Word puts

618
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:25,759
a period, don't put a question mark. When God said it, it settles it. Sometimes, well, I just got to be

619
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:30,499
able to figure it out. Listen, His ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts. If you

620
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:39,159
could figure out God, then you don't need God. I'm thankful that God has allowed us to know Him,

621
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:44,279
and we continue to desire to know Him, but I've submitted this to you on more than one occasion,

622
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:50,799
that the reality this morning is that as great as you think God is today in your life, He is far,

623
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:58,519
far greater than your mind could even imagine. You say, but I know that God is great. Yes, so did

624
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:05,519
David. And then he said this, that His greatness is unsearchable. That's Bible. Psalm 135, Psalm 145.

625
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,239
I know that the Lord is great. His greatness is unsearchable. You say there's a contradiction. No,

626
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:16,479
no contradiction whatsoever. I submit to you this morning, I know that God is great,

627
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:20,239
but does it mean I know everything about Him that I can explain it? No,

628
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:29,519
because His greatness is unsearchable, and we come to Him by faith. Amen? Man.

629
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:45,159
Man is not perfect. God is perfect. Man is fallible. God is infallible. Have you ever

630
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:54,959
said something and you said it wrong? Sure you have. I have said things when I've preached and

631
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:59,519
said, no, no, I didn't mean it that way. Let me rephrase that. Why? Because sometimes we get,

632
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,119
your mind gets thinking faster than your tongue can go. Now my tongue can go pretty fast,

633
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,919
but sometimes my mind goes faster. And you might say something, you might have it in the reverse

634
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:15,599
order or whatever it might be. Listen, God is perfect, and His Word is perfect. We think about

635
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,479
our spiritual diet, it's got to be selective and it's got to be scriptural. And we see,

636
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:25,999
number three this morning in closing, when we understand, when we evaluate our spiritual diet,

637
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:31,999
it must be selective, it must be scriptural, but the result is going to be this, you will be sound.

638
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:40,799
If you're selective and if you're scriptural, you will be sound. You will be sound. What do I mean

639
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:46,799
by the word sound? Well, we understand that God says in His Word many times, He talks about sound

640
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:54,079
doctrine. When He uses that word sound, He uses that to refer to that which is healthy,

641
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:02,479
or that which is free from any mixture of error. In verse 11 it says, these things, back in 1

642
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:07,119
Timothy chapter number 4, these things, we read that in verse number 6, where He said,

643
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,679
if you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, now in verse number 11, these things,

644
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:18,399
command and teach. He then says this, let no man despise thy youth. It's kind of interesting

645
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:23,679
because Timothy wasn't necessarily a very young man at this particular time, but he was definitely

646
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,639
younger than others. He says, let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers

647
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,279
in word and conversation and charity and spirit and faith in purity. Now I want you to just pause

648
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:39,199
for a moment and look at verse number 12. God says, let no man despise thy youth. And He tells

649
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,119
them what to do in being an example and what have you. And oftentimes we think about this in the

650
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,599
context of, you know, a younger person. Timothy wasn't specifically younger, probably in his 40s

651
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,799
actually. And that is kind of young, amen, I'm in my 40s, kind of young. But the reality is this,

652
00:39:54,799 --> 00:40:01,599
today, if I could make an application and not be doing any

653
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,259
service to the Scriptures, here's what I find what happens today. People will say something

654
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:11,899
like this, well, you just don't have a degree. You're just not as smart as we are. I mean,

655
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:16,739
I got a doctorate in some kind of whatever science and some kind of whatever. You know

656
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:22,999
what Romans 1 says, professing themselves to be wise? They became fools. Am I saying

657
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:27,319
that everyone that has a Ph.D. is a fool? I'm not saying that. Don't misquote me. What

658
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,419
I'm saying this morning is that God's wisdom and earthly wisdom are two very different

659
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:46,839
things. Two very different things. You know what happens sometimes? The intellectual movement

660
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,859
causes people to not accept this book by faith because intellectually they just can't. And

661
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:57,499
then they start trying to, well, you're just not very smart. I'd rather be biblical than

662
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:06,099
smart. Am I against education? No, I have a degree. I've taken other classes and I've

663
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:11,059
done different things over the years. But you know what? My confidence is not in my

664
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:20,459
degree. My confidence in that book, the Bible. Do you know, can I share a secret with you?

665
00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:24,779
There's some people that taught me things when I got that degree that were contrary

666
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:32,379
to what that book says. You know why? Because they're men. They were wrong. They got it

667
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:38,219
wrong. You know what? As you study Scripture and you compare Scripture with Scripture and

668
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:41,299
you're a student of the Word, you're like, well, actually that's really not what the

669
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:53,019
Bible says. Actually the Bible says this, being sound. He says in verse 13, till I come.

670
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:59,099
Remember, Paul was planning to come to Ephesus to be with Timothy and Timothy was left there

671
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,819
just as Titus was left in Crete and he had a job, he had a mission, he had a ministry

672
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:08,839
to do. And Paul said in verse 15 of chapter number 3, if I tarry long. He's writing these

673
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,599
things in verse number 14 and he says that if I tarry long that thou mayest know how

674
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,879
thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living God,

675
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:24,079
the pillar and ground of the truth. And so Paul has this plan, if you will, to go and

676
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,479
to be there, but he says in chapter number 4 in verse number 13, till I come. So I don't

677
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:33,479
know when I'm coming, if I tarry long my plan is to come, but till I come, notice, give

678
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:41,159
attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. That's what you need to be focused

679
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:49,279
on. Obviously, contextually, it would be with regard to the Scriptures. Remember Paul in

680
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:55,719
2 Timothy, he says, listen, bring me, what, especially the parchments. You know what he's

681
00:42:55,719 --> 00:43:00,319
referring to? He's talking about the Old Testament Scriptures. There's a missionary that was

682
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,479
going to the field and he was going to Africa and the journey was challenging. It was about

683
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:11,999
120 years ago and as he's going into the inner parts of the jungle, the journey was challenging

684
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,559
and difficult and he started with all kinds of materials and things he was going to take

685
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,919
as he was planning to go and reach a tribe and minister there and he had all these books,

686
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:27,439
his library with him and the journey was treacherous, the journey was challenging and little by

687
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,439
little he decided, you know what, I don't really think I need this book and I don't

688
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,199
really think I need this book and I'm going to leave this behind because I can't make

689
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,519
the journey with all of these books and eventually, you know what book he got there with? One,

690
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:47,839
the Bible. The Bible. Because there's one book I can't part with. See, Paul says, till

691
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,839
I come. We don't know when he was going to come. He said, if I tarry long, give attendance

692
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,079
to reading, exhortation to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given

693
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:08,239
thee by prophecy with the lying of the hands of the presbytery. Timothy was called into

694
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:17,199
the ministry, called by God, validated through the spiritual leaders. He then says this in

695
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:24,199
verse 15, meditate upon these things. Again, we see another reference to these things.

696
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:29,239
Those things that are healthy. Those things that are true. Notice where he says, give

697
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:38,919
thyself, notice where he says, holy to them. I'm not going to give myself holy or partially

698
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:44,399
to the truth that I, these things that I know and then partially to this other stuff because,

699
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:49,959
you know, I want to be open-minded. You hear that phrase today. It's common. You know,

700
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:57,679
you just got to be open-minded. You got to be, no, no, no. I got to be biblical. I got

701
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,119
to be biblical. I don't need to be open-minded. I need to be biblical. If God said it, this

702
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,039
settles it. Right? And in Sunday school this morning, in the marriage class, we were reading

703
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,759
some passages of scripture, the book of Genesis, the book of Matthew, and we read the portion

704
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:15,759
that says in the beginning, God made them male and female. I don't have to be open-minded

705
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:22,959
about it, and neither do you. Amen? The world's confused. You know why the world's confused?

706
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:30,039
Because they have an unhealthy diet. God's people shouldn't be confused. You know what's

707
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,559
really confusing to me is when you see a church that has crazy flags flying on it and crazy

708
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,839
statements on their marquees and all this stuff. Why? Because they've been given the

709
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:49,399
truth and they've forsaken it. Why? Because they want to be accepted? They want to be

710
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:55,479
politically correct? I'd rather be biblically accurate. Amen? You say, Pastor, this is your

711
00:45:55,479 --> 00:46:02,399
tread on some thin ice. I know. I understand. But it's God's Word. There's no compromise

712
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:13,319
on God's Word. Listen, one day, I'm going to stand before Jesus, and so are you. I don't

713
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:16,799
want to stand before Him and be like, well, you know, the pressures of the culture and

714
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:25,559
all that. No! God said it. And if you are selective and you are scriptural, you will

715
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:33,719
be sound. It might not be that you're popular, but you'll be sound. Notice, give thyself

716
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:38,959
wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all. And then verse 16, take heed unto

717
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:45,679
thyself. We'll see again a reference to this in chapter number 5. We'll keep it in a couple

718
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,119
of weeks. In verse 22, keep thyself pure. He says, take heed unto thyself and unto the

719
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:59,559
doctrine. Continue in them. Don't go looking for other stuff. Continue in what God has

720
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:08,719
said. Continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that

721
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:14,719
hear thee. Who are those that hear thee? Well, Timothy was ministering in the church at Ephesus.

722
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,079
And so as he's preaching, he's a pastor and he's ministering in the church at Ephesus,

723
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:21,759
we found out in verse number 6, putting the brethren in remembrance of these things, it

724
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:27,039
would be that he's a good minister and nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.

725
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,719
And we find that in verse 16, he says, continue in this. Take heed unto thyself and unto the

726
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:35,999
doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that

727
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:41,919
hear thee. Listen, it's not talking about saving and salvation, being saved from the

728
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:46,559
penalty of sin and going to heaven. That's not what verse 16 is talking about. You know

729
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,719
what 16 is talking about? Being saved from the false teachers. Being saved from, as it

730
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,559
says in verse number 4, those that are seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking

731
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,839
lies and hypocrisies. Listen, if you're built up in the faith, if you have a healthy diet,

732
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,239
you're going to be saved from that stuff. Delivered from it, not having all of that

733
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:16,999
confliction in your mind and in your spirit about what is, no, God gave us His Word. I'm

734
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:26,039
so thankful this morning. But I ask you, how's your diet? How's your diet? There's so much

735
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:37,679
that's available today. So much that's available today. You may get emails, you may receive

736
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,959
periodicals, whatever it is that you receive. You go on YouTube and you just start looking

737
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:49,519
at videos of this preacher or that preacher. Well, pastor, they must be right. They have

738
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:56,759
like 450,000 this and they got all this whatever. And, man, they had this video viewed 2.7 million

739
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:04,439
times and your video's only been viewed two times and, you know, blah, blah. Give me a

740
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:13,199
Who are they? What do they believe? Examine the source. Be selective. Be careful. Listen,

741
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,559
not everything that's available today is to be consumed by God's people. There are many

742
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:25,839
false prophets. There are many false teachers. And they're lying in wait to deceive. They

743
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,799
want to confuse you. They minister questions. They don't give answers. They minister questions.

744
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:39,359
This will put a little doubt in your mind. And that little doubt begins to grow. It can

745
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:47,479
mess with you. Don't put a question mark where God's put a period. Take God's Word as God's

746
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:56,559
Word and believe it. God commends through Paul the church at Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians

747
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,519
because when they received the Word of God, they received it not as the Word of men.

748
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:10,659
but it's the Word of God. And he says this, which effectually worketh in you that believe.

749
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:18,999
See they received it as it was the Word of God, not as the Word of man, but as the Word

750
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:26,079
of God. And God's Word effectually worketh in you. Be selective, be scriptural, and the

751
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,739
result is that you will be sound. You'll be sound in the faith. Let's pray. Father, we

752
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:35,419
love you. Thank you for loving us. Lord, if there's one not saved, I pray that today they'd

753
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:42,979
trust Christ as their Savior. We know that you died for all, that you love all, that

754
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:48,419
you offer forgiveness and how thankful we are for that. God, perhaps this morning there's

755
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:55,499
some that, if they'd be honest, their spiritual diet is not healthy. They've been reading

756
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:02,539
and watching and consuming those things that minister questions, that are vain jangling,

757
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:11,839
that are causing confusion and concern. Lord, they need to have a change of diet, some things

758
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:20,459
that must be refused, rejected. Lord, I pray that you'd help us to have a diet that is

759
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:26,539
healthy, spiritually speaking, that will build us up, that will result in stability and maturity,

760
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:32,739
that we'd be sound in the faith. I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives as

761
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:37,339
only you can. Well, thank you for these moments of invitation. For it's in Christ's name we

762
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:41,019
pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. We'll have a moment of invitation.

763
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:44,299
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible, show you how you can know for

764
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:49,059
sure that heaven's your home. Maybe God spoke to you this morning just very directly. Maybe

765
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:53,299
there's some things in your diet that are unhealthy that you need to deal with. You

766
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:57,859
need to confess it to the Lord and say, I'm not going to consume these things anymore.

767
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:02,899
Maybe you just want to come and pray and ask God to help you to have a diet that is healthy,

768
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:08,099
to keep you protected from those unhealthy things. As Kimberly plays, The Altar is Open.
