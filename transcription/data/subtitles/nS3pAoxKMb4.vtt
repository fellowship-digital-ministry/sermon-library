WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
Opportunity to look at this model prayer many times referred to as the Lord's Prayer and we know that we've

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.760
Repeated often throughout this mini-series

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.039
that the Lord never told his disciples to use this as a

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:21.260
Verbatim prayer that we just memorize and aimlessly or I should say mindlessly repeat the words

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.860
That are contained herein and all of the prayers that are recorded throughout the New Testament many of which we have studied over the years

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.739
You do not find that this is quoted verbatim

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.939
It's not just simply something to be repeated, but we find that the Lord Jesus Christ our wonderful Savior is giving

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:44.779
In response to the request of the disciple when he said Lord teach us to pray

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:51.880
the Lord Jesus Christ is providing framework a model if you will as I've said is we would use this kind of as a

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:55.340
Model and then add to it and begin to develop

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.720
Using as a guideline the truth that that the Lord gives us in this portion of Scripture and follow that

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.339
framework, I believe that it would cause us to be mindful of many things and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.019
Just to review quickly it would cause us to be mindful of our relationship

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.019
To the Lord and the fact that God Almighty is our father and he is the Lord God

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.500
Omnipotent that he reigns and rules but he is my father

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.540
I have access because I have relationship to as many as

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:32.660
as we've believed on the Lord Jesus Christ as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God according

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.199
To John 1 in verse number 12, and I'm so thankful that I can say

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260
father and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.139
Go to the Lord knowing that I have relationship. We understand that we would be mindful of the holiness and the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.419
Greatness of our God hallowed be thy name and you think about his greatness our father

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:57.339
Which are in heaven the psalmist said we know I know that the Lord is great

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.660
The psalmist said in Psalm 48 great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and you read through that portion of Scripture in Psalm

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.179
48 and you get to the very last verse of that passage and the Bible says this God is our God and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.059
After he goes through and describes the greatness of God and what a blessing to be mindful of how great our God is and the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.339
Reality that he is holy. We're mindful of his provision

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:28.100
I'm thankful for the good hand of God and for his provision for us as his children and the way that he takes care of

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.899
Us we're reminded of his forgiveness with thee there is forgiveness

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:37.339
we understand that our God is ready to pardon and ready to forgive and when the

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.100
It says there in in verse number four at the beginning and forgive us our sins

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.779
we're mindful of the fact that we're sinful people and we're mindful of the fact that our God is a

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:53.940
Forgiving God and I'm thankful that he has revealed that attribute of his to us in his word

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.619
we also as we studied last Wednesday evening have understood the importance and we'd be mindful of the importance of forgiving others and

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.740
someone said this as bread is to the

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.899
Human flesh so forgiveness is to the human soul and

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.300
how important it is that we would forgive one another that we would love one another and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.699
That we would not allow bitterness to grab root in our hearts in our lives

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.539
We understand that not only would we be mindful of these things that I've mentioned briefly

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:29.580
But it would also cause us to develop an attitude of reverence and submission

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.820
When we go to God in prayer and we follow the framework that is provided for us here and we use this model

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.820
It will help us to have

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:43.500
That attitude of reverence and that attitude of submission and I believe those are necessary

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:50.100
Attitudes when we go to God in prayer we find that as we would conclude this evening this particular

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.059
Model prayer and look at the last phrase of verse number four

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:02.080
We would note this evening that really it finishes with a twofold request that of direction and deliverance notice

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.100
Verse number four of Luke 11. The Bible says and forgive us our sins

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.660
For we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.820
But deliver us from evil

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.380
the title if you're taking notes this evening direction and

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:28.179
Deliverance direction and deliverance as we note this twofold request that completes verse number four

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.540
We are mindful of the fact that this is not a general request for direction and deliverance

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.459
I am thankful that our God does provide leadership guidance direction for his children and how we need

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.420
direction from God Almighty as you study the Old Testament you have the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.859
opportunity to see how God provided direction for the children of Israel as they wandered around as the

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:57.380
pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night and the leadership the direction that was provided in fact as you look

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.500
at the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.420
exodus and you look at their

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.660
exit from Egypt you find that the Bible specifically says God led them and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:13.420
I'm thankful for the leadership and direction that God provides and the reality is that we need God's direction and we understand that as

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.500
Our shepherd that he does guide us. He does lead us

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.899
I'm thankful for God's deliverance and I'm thankful that he's able to deliver us from anything

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:24.140
At times in our lives. He's able to

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:29.140
Instead of delivering us from something he will develop us through something

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.579
but we find this evening that the request the twofold request that completes verse number four is not a

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.260
general request for direction and deliverance, but it is a specific request with regard to temptation and

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.019
Evil notice the first phrase as we complete verse number four. It says lead us not

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:52.739
into temptation

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:57.859
Lead us not into temptation. It is a known reality that we have an enemy

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.179
Amen, we understand that we have an adversary the devil

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:09.859
He's a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour and we are mindful of the fact that we have an enemy

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.579
The reality is that a few chapters earlier if you turn back to Luke chapter number four

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.700
You'll find that God provides for us here in this portion of Scripture

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.820
the passage in which the devil tempted the Lord Jesus Christ while he was in the wilderness and we

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.660
understand that the Bible tells us in verse number one of Luke 4 and

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:34.940
Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness being 40 days

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.660
Tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward and hungered and

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.500
We are not gonna read through the whole portion

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.299
But I want you to notice in verse number 12

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:52.179
The Bible says in Jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.660
We find that it's in verse number four that he says it is written again in verse number eight

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.299
it is written and here in verse number 12, it is said by the way, the Lord is providing for us a

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.859
a

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.820
Model on how we respond to temptation using the Word of God

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:15.899
But notice in verse number 13 and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.260
We have an enemy if the enemy is gonna try to tempt the Lord Jesus Christ

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.459
And we understand the reason in which he would seek to tempt the Lord Jesus Christ

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:30.540
I'm thankful that our God was tempted in all points like as we are such as we are yet without sin and

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.739
What a blessing to understand the truth of that teaching of the Word of God

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:40.899
But for us as the people of God, we understand that we have an enemy and the enemy is going to tempt us

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:42.579
He's gonna tempt us to do evil

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:50.700
We understand that God has given us this great truth in first Corinthians 10 in verse number 13 as Paul is ministering to the believers

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.299
in Corinth a

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:58.899
Verse that is so important for us to understand and really if you go through the entirety of chapter number 10

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:01.899
He will Paul will use some some

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:06.339
information with regard to the Old Testament nation of Israel and

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:11.260
Share with them some historical data to help them understand

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.820
The the truth that he is giving to them and he says this in verse number 12 of first Corinthians 10

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.799
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:29.519
Verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:37.159
Notice these next four words that are worth highlighting underlining in your Bible, but God is faithful

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.840
But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:49.580
But will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.179
So we understand that we have an enemy we understand the reality of temptation

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:59.539
And we understand that our God is faithful and will provide as I like to call it an escape route

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.940
According to verse number 13 of first Corinthians 10

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:09.739
We also understand according to James chapter number 1 that our God does not tempt us to sin in James chapter

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:12.919
Number 1 is specifically in verses 13 through 15

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.900
We find that this truth is being given to us with regard to temptation to sin or to do evil

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.820
And in verse number 13 of James 1 the Bible says let no man say when he is tempted

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.419
I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:36.500
He any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.700
forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.099
so we understand

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:47.059
The the truth of temptation and we understand that we have an enemy

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:53.500
We think about this model that is given to us in Luke chapter number 11 and really the significance of this last statement

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.880
I I believe that it's helpful for us to understand that the Lord Jesus Christ is is giving this

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.040
model this framework to the disciples, of course by way of preservation to us this evening,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.480
so that we would be helped in our prayer time, so that we would understand and have some

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.400
guide as we go to God in prayer, that it's not just haphazardly praying, but we have

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.280
some framework in which we would follow. And he says, lead us not into temptation. I wonder

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:29.720
this evening, do we pray that God would keep us from temptation? I mean, really, do we

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.360
pray, God, would you help me as I go to this place, as I go throughout my day today, as

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.080
I'm interacting with these individuals, would you keep me, would you lead me not into temptation,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.560
would you help me in that area? And the reality is that if we begin to pray up like that,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.840
if we follow the framework and the model, I believe that we would be more aware of the

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.200
temptation when it's presented, right? Because we're praying about it, we're saying, God,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.040
lead me not, lead us not into temptation. And so we're mindful of the fact that we have

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.560
an enemy. Just by praying that way, lead us not into temptation, we are acknowledging

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.600
the fact that we have an enemy that's going to try to tempt us to sin. And we understand

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.280
that when we sin, yes, we have an advocate with the Father, and we are rejoicing and

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.120
thankful for that, but we also understand that it hinders our fellowship with God Almighty.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.120
And so we, as we would understand the model and understand what's taking place as the

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.380
Lord is giving this response to the disciples, and for us this evening when we say, Lord,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:43.460
lead us not into temptation, again, not just these vain words, just repetition, but really

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:49.120
being mindful of, hey, I'm, you know, I'm going to be in this place, amongst this situation,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.920
would you help me, would you lead me not into temptation? Notice the last phrase, but deliver

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.840
us from evil. Deliver us from evil. And so we see the direction and the deliverance.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.720
The reality is that, listen, though we know that there are times in which we face temptation,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:14.600
in fact, you may have been tempted to sin today. You know, the temptations come, and

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.320
so we say, listen, I don't want to be tempted, but we understand that the enemy is going

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.520
to tempt us, and so, therefore, when that temptation comes, deliver us from evil. Deliver

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.520
us from evil.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.279
I believe that, really, as we look at this thought at the end of verse number four, in

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:38.600
this really prayer for deliverance, that it reminds me of that escape route that I mentioned

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.220
that Paul speaks of in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, when he said, but God is faithful.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.100
And we must be mindful of that. Listen, the enemy wants to attack, and the enemy wants

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:54.380
to set a trap, the enemy wants us to fall into sin and to destroy our testimony and

00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.279
to have hindered fellowship with God Almighty, but we find that our God is faithful, not

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.980
only that it says, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able, but

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.620
then says, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.460
to bear it.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.779
I find, oftentimes, that it's unfortunate that too many of God's people are not looking

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.580
for the escape route, so to speak. I think about the illustrations, and we'll go over

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.340
the book of Genesis as we conclude this evening, but we think about the illustration of Joseph

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.460
and how Joseph retained his integrity, how that Joseph got out of the situation, but

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:40.340
we find if we were to contrast that with David, with the sin of Bathsheba, though he was told

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:46.779
when he inquired, asked to Bathsheba, who is she? Who is this woman? He is told who

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:53.460
she is, not only being the daughter of, but the wife of, and very specifically, he is

00:13:53.460 --> 00:14:01.300
made aware of the fact that she was another man's wife. And yet, he didn't look for the

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:07.020
escape route, did he? And we find that God will provide that way of escape, and when

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:13.180
the enemy tempts us, we're asking that God would deliver us from evil. You know, the

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.020
reality is that if we're saved this evening, if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:25.940
that you're no longer bound by sin. Sin no longer has dominion over us. When we were

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:31.660
lost before we trusted Christ as our Savior, the Bible describes us in a number of ways,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.179
but one way in which it describes us is that we were dead in our sins, in our trespasses.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:45.420
And we are not a sinner because we sin, rather we sin because we're sinners. We're born sinners,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.739
and therefore it's the outworking of being a sinner is that we sin, and we understand

00:14:50.739 --> 00:14:56.459
that we're dead in our sins and our trespasses, that we, apart from the deliverance that God

00:14:56.459 --> 00:15:02.779
provides through Calvary, we are bound by that sin. Notice what God says in Romans chapter

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.320
6 as Paul is speaking to the believers here and trying to help them understand this truth

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.559
of being delivered from the very power of sin. The Bible says in Romans 6, and we'll

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:21.720
pick it up in verse 12. Romans 6 and verse 12, the Bible says,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.440
Romans 6 12, let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:32.200
in the lust thereof, neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.000
unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and your

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.880
members as instruments of righteousness unto God. Because we're saved, we now can yield

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:51.239
ourselves unto God. Notice the truth of verse 14, for sin shall not have dominion over you,

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:57.520
for you're not under the law, but under grace. And I'm so thankful, notice Romans 8 and verse

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.880
number 2, where the Bible says, for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:11.000
made me free from the law of sin and death. And I'm no longer bound by the power of sin.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.720
We understand that the Bible teaches us that our flesh still has an appetite and still

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.839
has a desire. The Bible tells us in Galatians 5 that the Spirit is at enmity, or the flesh

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:27.119
is at enmity with the Spirit, they're contrary one to the other. And it says, the flesh lusteth

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:32.040
against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.080
to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would. So what's the answer? Walk

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.559
in the Spirit, that you should not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:46.600
So when we understand that we have an enemy, when we understand that he's seeking to tempt

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.239
us, and that temptation is going to come in our lives, and the enemy is going to seek

00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:58.800
to tempt us to do evil, and if we're mindful of how the Lord provides this framework and

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.360
this model prayer, that we would be mindful of praying for God's direction and for God's

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.480
deliverance with regards specifically to temptation and to evil. I'm mindful, we'll get to Genesis

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:16.040
39 in just a moment, but turn to Proverbs chapter number 1, if you will, and let me

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.399
just share with you a thought from this portion of Scripture before we get there to Genesis

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:27.399
chapter 39. But in Proverbs chapter number 1, verse number 10, the Bible says, My son,

00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:38.160
if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.040
for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause. Let us swallow them up alive

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.100
as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit. We shall find all precious substance,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.720
we shall fill our houses with spoil. Cast in thy lot among us, let us all have one purse.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.839
They're making it sound good, right? I mean, they're enticing you to do evil. And he tells

00:17:57.839 --> 00:18:01.119
them, consent thou not. In verse number 10, he's telling them what they're going to say.

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:04.720
Here's what they're going to say. Come with us and do these things. And this will be the

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.119
result. Verse 15, My son, walk not thou in the way with them. Refrain thy foot from

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:15.720
their path, for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood. Surely in vain the

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.959
net is spread in the sight of any bird. I'm mindful of this passage when I think about

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:24.920
the phraseology in verse number 10, when it says, If sinners entice thee, consent thou

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:31.480
not. We think about the temptation of our enemy. You know, he makes it look good. He

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:38.599
makes sin look desirable. He makes sin look like it's going to benefit us somehow. And

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:43.160
we find that he makes it look shimmery and shiny and makes it look appealing. And in

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:49.919
doing so, he's seeking to entice us to engage in whatever that particular sinful activity

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:56.520
is. But when we're mindful of this model prayer, if we would pray in this fashion, if we would

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.080
be mindful of that which the Lord is giving to the disciples, perhaps we would become

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.679
more actively aware of the escape routes that God would provide us with. And perhaps we

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:13.720
would face less temptation because we would be mindful on a more regular basis. And we

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:19.000
would be ready and prepared as we were praying in that fashion. Look at Genesis 39, and we'll

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.840
finish here this evening before we have our time of prayer. In Genesis chapter 39, a great

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.080
portion of Scripture with regard to the Bible character of Joseph, and of course we understand

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:38.280
that he's there, and he's prospering, and God is blessing, and he's in Potiphar's house,

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.280
and the Lord blessed him, and the Lord blessed the Egyptians' house for Joseph's sake, according

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.359
to verse number 5. But you find that the Bible says, notice verse 6, And he left all that

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:52.799
he had in Joseph's hand, speaking of Potiphar, and he knew not all he had, save the bread

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:57.280
which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored. And it came to pass

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.840
after these things, that his master's wife cast her

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.080
eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.320
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wilteth not what is

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.200
with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.600
There is none greater in this house than I, neither hath he kept back anything from me

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.760
but thee, because thou art his wife.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.960
How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.520
I want you to notice in verse number 10, I mean, that's a good response from Joseph,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.000
is it not?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.840
Commendable response.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.920
It would have been evil, it would have been wicked for him to engage in this act that

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.720
this Potiphar's wife desired for Joseph to engage in this activity.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.240
It would be sinful, it would be wicked.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.800
He said, How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.280
What a great response from Joseph in this passage of Scripture.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.520
And sometimes when temptation comes in our lives, man, we are ready for it in the sense

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.920
of we've prayed, perhaps, and we're acknowledging it and we respond properly, but you understand

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:09.120
the devil doesn't just depart after one time of resisting that temptation, of providing

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120
that answer.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.760
In Luke chapter number 4, when the enemy, when the devil is tempting the Lord Jesus

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:20.680
Christ, after the first response of Jesus, when Jesus said it is written, the devil didn't

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.320
just leave.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320
He tempted him a second time, and then a third time.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.200
And I read verse number 12 of Luke 4, particularly this evening, because the Bible says that

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.800
he departed for a season, and we find that here in the life of Joseph, he responds properly.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.760
But I want you to notice in verse number 10, it says, And it came to pass, as she spake

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.800
to Joseph, what does it say?

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800
Day by day.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800
You know what the enemy tries to do?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.000
He tries to wear you down.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.640
Bring that temptation day by day, day by day.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.320
Wear you down.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:04.160
Somebody said that the enemy, the devil, will go by your door, quote-unquote, every day,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.080
go by it a thousand times to find it cracked just once.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.080
And the analogy or the imagery that they were using in making that statement is that, listen,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.440
though we have responded properly and though we've walked in the Spirit, we must understand

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.600
that the enemy is going to continue to come, and it says, day by day, that he hearkened

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.000
not unto her, to lie by her, to be with her.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.800
And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.240
there was none of the men of the house there within.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.600
And so we find that verse number 12 tells us that she was going to capitalize on this

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.700
opportunity, if you will, and it says that she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.700
with me.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.560
And he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.120
I've often said, as I've looked at verse number 12 of Genesis 39, that Joseph lost

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.200
his coat, but he retained his character.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.280
It was far better for Joseph to spend time in prison, falsely accused, than to have engaged

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.600
in that sinful behavior.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.600
Amen?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.040
You say, well, that's not so great, being in prison.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.840
I understand, but we're going to stand before God.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.240
It'd be better to be falsely accused and suffer, not for wrongdoing, but suffer for being wrongly

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.160
accused and being right with God.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.040
And we understand that God knew all that was going on, and God had a plan, and we're familiar

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.040
with, of course, the life of Joseph and all that comes to pass, and the way in which God's

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.320
plan was working out.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.920
You understand in our lives, and I don't want to get too off track from what the subject

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.680
matter is this evening, but God has a plan.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.640
And if Joseph didn't end up in that prison, I'm not so sure that he would have met the

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.120
butler or the baker.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120
Right?

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:57.280
And if he didn't meet the butler, perhaps it would not have been possible for Pharaoh,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.800
when he had a dream, to say, hey, who's going to interpret?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.800
You know?

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.280
And so we begin to look at how God is God.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.040
But as we look at the subject matter which we're dealing with this evening, you find

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.680
that Joseph responds properly to this temptation.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.960
The temptation came on one particular day, and then it came day by day, day by day, and

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.600
she kept saying, lie with me, lie with me, and then she tries to seize the opportunity

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.080
when there's no one else around, and Joseph got himself out of the situation.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:34.960
There's a little kid's song, Put On Your Running Shoes, and the thought of fleeing from temptation,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:41.040
fleeing from youthful lust, and we see that as Paul would say that truth to Timothy.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.400
And this evening, when we think about the model prayer as it ends here in Luke 11, in

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.720
verse number 4, and we've looked at all of these phrases, and we've studied through this,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.820
and we come to this last section when it says, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.820
from evil.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:02.100
And we think about God's direction and God's deliverance, not generally speaking, but specifically

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.540
with regard to temptation and to evil.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:13.100
And again, as I mentioned a moment ago, if we would follow the framework of this model

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.180
prayer, we would be mindful of many things.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.620
I mentioned a whole list of those as we started our message this evening, recapping the first

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:28.140
few verses of this portion of Scripture and how we would be mindful of those great truths.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.020
But as we finish this evening, we would be mindful of temptation.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.540
You'd be aware, listen, the devil's going to try to tempt me today.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.340
He's going to try to tempt you today.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.580
He's going to try to tempt you when you go home in just a little while, right?

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.900
He wants to cause us to sin.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.300
He wants us to have hindered fellowship.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:55.260
He wants us to lose our testimony with those that we're seeking to share the gospel with.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.500
You think about David and his great sin with Bathsheba, it brought reproach against the

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.900
name of God that the enemy could speak ill of.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:13.980
You begin to consider this prayer of direction or for direction and deliverance, oh, that

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.620
we would be mindful this evening that we have an enemy, but we have a God who is faithful.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:26.020
He's not going to suffer us, allow us to be tempted above that which we are able.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.580
He says that He'll also provide a way to escape.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.980
And I think as God's people, we need to be more, and if we'd be praying in this fashion,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:41.100
in this manner, maybe we'd be more actively engaged in looking for the escape route.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.620
Because we've been mindful to pray for the direction, lead us not into temptation, deliver

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.340
us from evil, amen?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.340
A prayer for direction and a prayer for deliverance, oh, that God would help us to walk wholly.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:04.540
That we'd be holy in all matter of conversation, according to what He says in 1 Peter 1.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.540
Let's pray together.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.140
Father, we love You.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.580
Thank You for loving us.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:15.020
We know that we have an enemy, and we know that the enemy, even as he tempted the Lord

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:20.540
Jesus Christ there in the wilderness, he seeks to tempt us to do evil, to sin, that it might

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:27.500
hinder our walk with Thee, adversely impact our testimony for Thee.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:34.060
God, I pray that You'd help us as we see and conclude this model prayer this evening, to

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:41.020
be mindful of the work of the enemy.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:49.580
God that You would help us to be aware of and mindful of the promise that You've given

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.100
us there in 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 13.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.260
God that we would actively look for the escape route when that temptation comes, because

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.380
we've prayed for deliverance, deliver us from evil.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.620
We do thank You for the privilege of corporate prayer, and I pray that as we now enter into

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.500
this time of our service, as we pray one with another, that Lord, You'd be glorified.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.100
We'll thank You for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.420
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:21.900
Anyone need one?
