1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
to Revelation chapter number two.

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:05,400
And this evening, as you see in the bulletin,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,880
as I mentioned at the close of the service this morning,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,880
we'll be dealing with the church at Thyatira,

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,079
but only the first aspect of the church.

6
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,640
And we'll look at just a couple of verses this evening.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,000
The city of Thyatira was a relatively small city,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,959
but it was wealthy.

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,559
And they were well known for several different things,

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,440
but most, I guess, famous, if you will.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,119
They were known for their wool and for their dyeing industry.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,080
And Acts 16 and verse 14, we're told about Lydia.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,000
And she was a seller of purple,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,959
and she was from the city of Thyatira.

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,959
And we read about that in Acts 16 and verse 14.

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,720
It gives us a little bit of insight

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,779
with regard to some of the commercial trade

18
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,000
and what they were very well known for.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,479
The city was located approximately 35 miles

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,000
southeast of Pergamos.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Of course, we dealt with, last Sunday evening,

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
the message to the church at Pergamos.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,759
We find that the Lord, as we begin studying

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,080
this particular letter to the church at Thyatira,

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,120
once again, is going to emphasize a particular aspect

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,199
about his nature to this church.

27
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,120
In verse 18, the Bible says,

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,839
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write,

29
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,000
these things saith the Son of God,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,800
who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire,

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,959
and his feet are like fine brass.

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,660
And really, that reminds us of what had been said

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,099
in chapter one, verses 14 and 15.

34
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,860
And when we see these two references,

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,620
to his eyes like unto a flame of fire,

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,459
and his feet are like fine brass,

37
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,980
it reminds us that he sees all and he judges all.

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,180
And there is nothing hidden from our God.

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,059
There's nothing in your life, my life,

40
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:49,139
or anyone else's life that is hidden from God.

41
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,080
As much as man has tried to cover their sin,

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,059
as much as man has tried to hide things from God,

43
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,339
the reality is that God knows all things.

44
00:01:57,339 --> 00:02:00,620
God knows the thoughts of your heart, of my heart.

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,339
And we are reminded that not only does he see all,

46
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,779
but he judges all.

47
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,900
He is the judge of the entire earth.

48
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,899
We find that as we look at this letter

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,380
to the church in Thyatira,

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,100
it is this letter that is the longest

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,580
of the seven letters that we read

52
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,660
in Revelation 2 and Revelation 3.

53
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,979
And we find that with the length of this letter,

54
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,059
that's one of the reasons

55
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,740
that we're only gonna focus tonight

56
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,899
on just a couple of the verses,

57
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,539
because we'll have a multi-part

58
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,100
as we try to make our way through this particular letter.

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,940
It's very interesting as we've studied

60
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,500
through these letters up to this point,

61
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,740
and I'll say it my way of introduction,

62
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,839
we begin to think about a church under the evaluation,

63
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,259
the examination of the Lord Jesus Christ,

64
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,779
who is the head of the church.

65
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,339
We find that he's examining,

66
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,399
he's evaluating the ministries

67
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,839
of these particular churches.

68
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course, we understand that they are literal churches

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,119
that existed at the time of the writing.

70
00:02:57,119 --> 00:03:01,160
They are local bodies of believers.

71
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,880
And we find that as he would go through the process

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
of having these letters sent

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,039
and evaluating the ministry,

74
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,559
that you find many times,

75
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,600
and it's quite interesting

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,720
as we look at the church in Thyatira,

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,679
that there's really almost a direct opposite

78
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,000
with what you find here in the church at Thyatira

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,059
versus the church in Ephesus.

80
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,699
We find that the church in Ephesus was,

81
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,699
they could not, they would not allow for any type of evil.

82
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,020
They were very sound

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,779
with regard to their doctrine and what have you,

84
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:37,660
but they had left their first love.

85
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,860
They had departed from their first works.

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,820
And yet we find the church in Thyatira

87
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,339
where they're growing in their works

88
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,539
and they're being commended for these things,

89
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,779
but yet doctrinal error is coming in.

90
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,220
When we begin to think about these things

91
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,979
as you look through these letters,

92
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,539
we really are reminded that the goal in ministry

93
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,339
is to be balanced.

94
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,740
And how important it is that we're balanced

95
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,779
in our own lives individually in our homes,

96
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:05,500
but in our churches,

97
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,600
where we have the right position and the right disposition.

98
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,820
We believe the right thing and we behave the right way.

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,299
We are doing what God's called us to do

100
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,100
while holding firm to the truth that God has given to us.

101
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,380
And so often, as I mentioned last week,

102
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,739
with regard to the temptation for compromise,

103
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:32,500
so often there's some area that we begin to falter in

104
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,820
and we might keep things going well here

105
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,739
and we're staying sound here, but we're compromising here.

106
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:41,299
And there's this need for balance in ministry

107
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,399
and that we understand that everything is important.

108
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,660
There's not certain things to say,

109
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,339
we're just gonna focus on these things

110
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,679
and let all these things slide.

111
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,579
We're gonna find ourselves in trouble.

112
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,899
And we find here this evening that as the Lord Jesus Christ

113
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,420
is having this letter written to the church in Thyatira,

114
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,380
he says in verse 19, as we have noted

115
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,220
in each of these letters, I know thy works.

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,019
Notice with me the entirety of verse 19.

117
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,440
He says, I know thy works and charity and service and faith

118
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,059
and thy patience and thy works.

119
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,500
He says it a second time.

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,179
And notice this last phrase of verse number 19

121
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:22,660
and the last to be more than the first.

122
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,779
As we begin to examine that phrase at the end of verse 19,

123
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,339
it would seem as if the Lord is saying to this church

124
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,299
in these five areas that are mentioned in verse 19

125
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,700
that they were growing, that they were progressing

126
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,899
in these particular areas because he says

127
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:40,619
that the last is more than the first.

128
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,779
It's interesting because again, as I mentioned already

129
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,579
to the church at Ephesus, in verse number five

130
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,119
of chapter two, the Bible says, remember therefore

131
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,940
from whence thou art fallen and repent.

132
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,579
And notice where it says, and do the first works

133
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,220
or else I will come unto thee quickly

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,399
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place

135
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,179
except thou repent.

136
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,600
As we look at the church in Thyatira, he says,

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,619
I know thy works and charity and service and faith

138
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:12,000
and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
than the first.

140
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,040
The reality is that God's people are to be growing.

141
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,200
Amen?

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,019
We're to grow.

143
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,200
The Bible teaches us as newborn babes,

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,920
desire the sincere milk of the word

145
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,399
that ye may grow thereby.

146
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,700
Is that what first Peter two verse number two says?

147
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,799
When Peter writes in second Peter chapter three

148
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:34,380
in verse 18, but grow in grace and knowledge

149
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,399
of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.

150
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,679
And the Christian life is about growth.

151
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,959
And the thing that's amazing about the Christian life

152
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,399
is that your growth and my growth is not going

153
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,720
to be restricted to some growth chart

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,239
that somebody provides.

155
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,519
No, we understand that we can grow as quickly

156
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,359
as we wanna grow.

157
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,959
We can be as close to God as we wanna be.

158
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,480
We can be as spiritual as we wanna be.

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,760
And the reality is that as Paul is writing

160
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,559
to the believers in the book of Hebrews,

161
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,079
he tells us for in the time that you ought to be teachers.

162
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,279
Why does he use that phraseology in Hebrews five

163
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,480
in verse number 12?

164
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,799
Because they should have been growing.

165
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,559
For in the time that you ought to be teachers,

166
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,119
he says to them, you have need that one teach you again,

167
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:26,559
which be the first principles of the oracles of God

168
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:29,839
and are become such as have need of milk

169
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,239
and not of strong meat.

170
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:35,059
And so what is Paul saying to these believers

171
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,760
that he's addressing in the book of Hebrews?

172
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,320
He's saying to them, you ought to be growing,

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,420
but you're not.

174
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,720
And so growth is expected in the Christian life.

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,399
Is that a fair statement this evening?

176
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,480
Growth is expected in the Christian life.

177
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
If the church is a body of believers,

178
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,040
if the church, it's not the building, it's the people,

179
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,799
the church is a called out assembly.

180
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:03,420
And if the church is made up of individual saved

181
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,399
and baptized believers who have voluntarily

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,359
joined themselves together for the carrying out

183
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:11,880
of the great commission, if that is a simple definition

184
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,239
this evening of the church, the local church,

185
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,299
and we believe that as Christians were to be growing,

186
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,440
then we could easily say this tonight

187
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,519
that churches should be growing.

188
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
Churches should be growing.

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,119
Here's one of the problems with growth.

190
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,540
There's been such an emphasis over the last couple

191
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,359
of generations with regard to church growth

192
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,520
being strictly numerical.

193
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,239
And there's this numerical focus and emphasis

194
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,080
on church growth.

195
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,320
Let me be quick to say this,

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,039
I'm all for the church growing numerically.

197
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,719
It means that you're reaching people.

198
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,479
It means that you're investing in people

199
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,880
and I'm all for the church growing numerically,

200
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
but the reality is that a church needs

201
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,119
to be growing spiritually.

202
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:59,559
It's not one or the other, it should be both.

203
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,840
A church should be growing numerically

204
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,520
and a church should be growing spiritually.

205
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,799
And it's so important when we understand the truth

206
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,099
of the great commission when the Lord Jesus Christ

207
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:12,000
before his ascension, he gives the great commission

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,880
in its most detailed setting in Matthew chapter 28

209
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,320
and he lays out three aspects with regard

210
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
to the great commission, not only preaching the gospel

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,280
so that people could be saved, not only baptizing them

212
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,440
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

213
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,119
but teaching them to observe all things whatsoever

214
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:34,320
I have commanded you and we find that that third aspect

215
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,320
of discipleship is so vital for a local church.

216
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,479
And so a church ought to be growing.

217
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:44,880
The church in Thyatira, as we look at verse number 19,

218
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
it seems as if they're growing

219
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
and we'll reference these five areas.

220
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,020
Another church that we find in the New Testament

221
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,479
that will be referenced a couple of times this evening

222
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,080
that was a growing church is the church in Thessalonica.

223
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,039
And that church is growing.

224
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,880
It's quite.

225
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,840
First thing is you study 1st and 2nd Thessalonians and you make some very obvious comparisons

226
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,240
between the two books and you see that the Bible speaks about how they're growing.

227
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,040
In fact, your faith groweth exceedingly.

228
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,040
What a blessing to be hearing those words and to be the reality of a church that is

229
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,160
growing in that regard.

230
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,120
And so this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture we note these five areas.

231
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,700
Note them with me quickly.

232
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,920
Number one, they were growing in works.

233
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,740
Now understand this evening, and it's a Sunday night so I believe that we'd all be aware

234
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,540
of this truth already, but it's important to make it known.

235
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,500
The reality is that works cannot save us.

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,860
Amen?

237
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,500
Works cannot save us.

238
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,340
Not only can they not save us, but they can't keep us saved.

239
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,060
Not by works of righteousness which we have done.

240
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,060
For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of

241
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
God.

242
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,420
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

243
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,260
And we find that even as we study the Scriptures and as Brianna sang that song this morning

244
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,640
and I referenced it from the truth from Isaiah, that all of our good works are as filthy rags.

245
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,620
But the reality is that after we're saved, when we read Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8

246
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,460
and 9 which I quoted a minute ago, the Bible goes on to say that we are His workmanship

247
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:34,060
created in Christ Jesus and the Bible says this, unto good works which God hath before

248
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,540
ordained that we should walk in them.

249
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
In what?

250
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
In the good works.

251
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,060
Again, as you study the book of Ephesians and that's Ephesians chapter 2 and verse

252
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,980
number 10, it's very clear throughout the six chapters in the book of Ephesians that

253
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,300
our works have nothing to do with our standing before God as far as being saved.

254
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,900
Our position is secure in Christ.

255
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,140
We're saved by the grace of God, by the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, His death,

256
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,380
burial, and resurrection.

257
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,860
But because we are saved, we ought to do good works.

258
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,779
We ought to be involved in this area of works.

259
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:21,260
Titus chapter 2 says this, in fact if you were to study through the three chapters in

260
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,220
the book of Titus, there's emphasis with regard to works.

261
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,020
But notice Titus 2, the Bible says this in verse number 11, Titus chapter 2 and verse

262
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,139
number 11, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.

263
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,900
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

264
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,779
I'm thankful that God's grace and it brings salvation, that it's appeared to all men.

265
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,020
And then notice what God's grace teaches us according to verse 12, teaching us that denying

266
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,980
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present

267
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,820
world.

268
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,860
Then notice verse 13, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great

269
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,220
God and our Savior Jesus Christ.

270
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,139
Think about the summary of these three verses, that the grace of God that brings salvation

271
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:16,740
appeared to all men and it teaches us how we're to live our lives.

272
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,860
This idea in Jude where they've turned the grace of God into lasciviousness is completely

273
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,460
contrary to what we find the Bible teaching us in Titus 2 in verse number 12.

274
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,779
God's grace does not say go out and sin because where sin abounds, grace is more.

275
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,380
No, it says that we're to live godly.

276
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,100
We find that He says that we're to look for the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

277
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,980
and I'm so thankful that one day He's coming back.

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:53,180
But notice with me in verse 14, who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity

279
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,100
and purify unto Himself a peculiar people.

280
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,340
Notice what they're to be zealous of, zealous of good works.

281
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,559
The book of James is often misunderstood because in the book of James there are many

282
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,620
references with regard to good works and our works and you say that you have faith and

283
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,580
show me your works and all of the verses of Scripture that deal with works and I've said

284
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:24,739
before and I think it's an easy understanding that what James is focusing on is not the

285
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:29,940
root of salvation but he's dealing with the fruit of salvation.

286
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:38,100
Because I'm saved, I am His workmanship created in Christ Jesus and here we find that the

287
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,260
Lord says to the church in Thyatira, I know thy works and then He says again at the end

288
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,339
after He lists the next things, He says and thy works.

289
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:49,540
They're busy serving the Lord.

290
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,459
Their service is mentioned in a moment and we'll look at that here as we go through it

291
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,000
but we find they're growing in works.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,339
Number two, they're growing in charity.

293
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,420
Notice it says I know thy works and charity.

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,540
Oh, how important it is that we love people but you understand this evening that loving

295
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,080
people cannot be separated from telling people the truth.

296
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,300
So often today the idea is that if you love them or because you love them then you just

297
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,619
kind of accept whatever and let it all be what it wants to be because well, that's just

298
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:26,619
love.

299
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:32,020
But the reality is that love speaks the truth.

300
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,220
And we find in the scriptures the importance of growing in charity.

301
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,020
We understand the importance of loving God and loving people and we understand that we're

302
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:49,020
to love our brethren and we're to have that brotherly love one for another and the Bible

303
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,580
says that God knows their works and He knows their charity and the reality is that God

304
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,559
knows our works and He knows our charity.

305
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,500
Look over the book of 1 Thessalonians if you will and chapter number four and 1 Thessalonians

306
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:12,300
chapter number four and I want you to note with me what is said about the church in Thessalonica

307
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,619
with regard to their love.

308
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:21,140
And notice with me if you will in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four verses nine and ten the

309
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,420
Bible says this, but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for

310
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,000
ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed you do it toward all the

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,020
brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more

312
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
and more.

313
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,179
And so we find that the church in Thessalonica is being encouraged, they're being challenged

314
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,380
and they're love one for another and Paul says I know that you're doing it but don't

315
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,420
be content, don't get comfortable, increase.

316
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:02,059
Notice in Romans chapter twelve, in Romans chapter number twelve in verse number nine,

317
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,420
Romans chapter twelve in verse number nine and I want you to notice what the Bible says

318
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:14,540
here and Romans twelve in verse number nine, let love be without dissimulation, let love

319
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,020
be without dissimulation.

320
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,739
The reality is that when we speak about our love it's to be a love that is sincere, without

321
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:28,179
hypocrisy and we find that he says not only and it's interesting in the same verse of

322
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,700
scripture let love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which

323
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,700
is good.

324
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,220
Love speaks the truth and it must speak the truth.

325
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,179
The reality is that if you're not speaking the truth to someone while at the same time

326
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:55,100
saying that you're loving that person there's a disconnect between those two comments.

327
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,739
There's a problem with that because love speaks the truth and here they're growing in their

328
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,899
works, they're growing in their charity.

329
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:08,779
Number three it says end service, end service.

330
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:12,820
What a blessing it is to serve the Lord and we spoke already about their work so I won't

331
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,179
belabor the point but look at first Peter chapter four if you will, first Peter chapter

332
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,179
number four and I want you to notice what the Bible says here in first Peter chapter

333
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,220
four verses ten and eleven with regard to our service.

334
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,299
I was, had some conversations today actually with a couple of different sets of people

335
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:37,900
and in both of, two of the conversations that I had I mentioned about our service for the

336
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,539
Lord and one of them in particular I mentioned about the truth of Joshua standing up and

337
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,940
saying as for me and my house we will what?

338
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,739
Serve the Lord.

339
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:56,500
Now listen Joshua didn't say that so that in 2025 it could be marketed all over the

340
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,099
place to be hung in your home and my home.

341
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,660
He said that because he was drawing a line in the sand and he was saying listen choose

342
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,140
you this day whom you're going to serve.

343
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,299
How are you going to go, how are you going to go forward?

344
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,299
What are you going to do?

345
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,780
Are you going to serve the gods of the people in the land?

346
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,140
Are you going to serve the gods that they served before the flood?

347
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,820
What are you going to do?

348
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,539
As for me and my house we are going to serve the Lord.

349
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:26,140
So then we ask this question, what does it mean to serve the Lord?

350
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,739
How do we serve the Lord?

351
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,479
Why should we serve the Lord?

352
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,979
How do we serve the Lord together as a family?

353
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:38,559
How do we serve the Lord in a time in which things are so busy and there's so many demands

354
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,299
upon our lives and going to and fro and all that's taking place and yet we find that this

355
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,140
church in Thyatira they're serving the Lord.

356
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Notice in 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse number 10 the Bible says as every man hath received

357
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
the gift.

358
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,140
How many have received the gift?

359
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,320
Is anyone excluded?

360
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
If you're saved.

361
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,320


362
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,880
If you're here and you're saved that means you've received a gift

363
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,520
Amen, and it's not simply talking about the gift of salvation. Although that's a wonderful gift

364
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,400
It's the gift of God, which is eternal life. But here he's talking about spiritual gifts

365
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,360
He talks to the church in Corinth. He talks in Romans

366
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,220
About the spiritual gifts and he says as every man hath received the gift notice even so

367
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
minister the same one to another

368
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,000
And then notice how he refers to this

369
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:37,960
This service or this ministry. He says as good stewards of the manifold grace of God

370
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,680
The Bible tells us in 1st Corinthians chapter 2 that it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful

371
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,120
and the reality is that God has been faithful and God has been gracious to give to us a

372
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,080
spiritual gift and to impart to us grace and

373
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,960
Then he says to us as the individual believers that we are to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God

374
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,080
What are we doing with what God has entrusted us with?

375
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:14,200
How are we using our talents and our gifts for the honor and glory of God verse 11?

376
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,080
if any man speak

377
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,680
Let him speak as the oracles of God

378
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,900
If any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,800
That God and all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion

380
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
forever and ever

381
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,760
Amen, here's a wonderful couple of truths from verse number 11

382
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,000
The Bible says that we're to serve God with our spiritual gift

383
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,600
We're not to serve in such a way that we are to receive glory

384
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,640
No, we're to serve so that he would receive the glory

385
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,920
He says that if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth

386
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,800
God is going to require of us based upon the ability that he has given to us and

387
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,080
Yes, it is our responsibility to develop that to

388
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,920
You know try to come to that place where we are

389
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,760
Using and developing and being the best that we can be for the glory of God

390
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,000
but the reality is it's all for the glory of God and

391
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,480
He says to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever

392
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,400
Amen

393
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
You know when we serve the Lord

394
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
It's so that God would be glorified

395
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,960
Because if I recognize this evening that it's God who has enabled me if you recognize this evening that it's God who has enabled

396
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,520
You and God who has gifted you and you're using it for the honor and glory of God

397
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,040
Then when man applauds you simply reflect or deflect and say no to God be the glory

398
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,600
Because without him truly as John as Jesus said in John without him I can do nothing

399
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,080
The same is true of you this evening. You say but let me tell you about all the talents that I have

400
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Listen, let me tell you about the fact that God gave them to you

401
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,320
Amen

402
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
God gave them to us

403
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,300
And so we see that this church is growing in their works and their charity in their service

404
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,740
Notice the Bible says back in Revelation 2 in verse 19 as he goes through this process of listing this out. He says and

405
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,940
Faith, I want you to think about faith just for a moment this evening

406
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,860
The reality is that the Bible tells us repeatedly that the just shall live by

407
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:41,040
Faith right. So what the Bible says the just shall live by faith. The Bible says that without faith it is

408
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Impossible to please God in

409
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,160
Hebrews 11 in verse number 6 for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a

410
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,800
Rewarder of them that diligently seek him

411
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,120
We have the entirety of Hebrews chapter 11 that talks about by faith

412
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,560
This person did this and by faith this person did this and really all that's taking place is the individuals that are mentioned in Hebrews

413
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
chapter 11

414
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Believed what God said

415
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,040
Faith is an action. They took God at his word. They stepped out by faith

416
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,320
Abraham went to a land that he did not know why because he believed God he had faith

417
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,279
Noah built an ark that he did not know anything about with regard to rain and so on and so forth

418
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
But he believed God

419
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,600
In this evening as we begin to look at this idea of our faith and we understand the importance of having

420
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,720
Faith and growing in our faith. How does our faith grow?

421
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Well, you know the answer

422
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,360
Romans chapter number 10, so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God

423
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,640
You know how your faith grows, you know how my faith grows

424
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,559
It's through getting into the Bible and getting the Bible into us and we begin to learn

425
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,240
About the character and nature of our God we begin to see

426
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,240
What our God has done and what he's capable of doing and all of a sudden it begins to increase our faith

427
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,960
It grows our faith. Have you ever heard somebody say well, I don't have their kind of faith

428
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Where did they get that faith?

429
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,520
They got the faith by being in the book

430
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,000
This evening we read about the church and Thessalonica. I mentioned that we'd reference them twice look in second Thessalonians

431
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,559
Chapter number one and I want you to notice what the Bible says here in second Thessalonians chapter number one

432
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,440
What a what a statement that's made about the church in Thessalonica

433
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
With regard to their faith

434
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,440
In second Thessalonians 1 in verse 3 the Bible says we are bound

435
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,640
To thank God always for you brethren as it is meat

436
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Notice this because that your faith

437
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
groweth

438
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Exceedingly

439
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,279
The

440
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,480
Charity of every one of you all toward each other

441
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,360
Aboundeth we mentioned in the second point this evening of the church in Thyatira about their charity in here

442
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,679
We find that even in the church of Thessalonica after they were encouraged in the first

443
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Letter in chapter 4 to increase more and more that the Bible says that their charity is abounding

444
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,440
But it says that their faith is growing exceedingly

445
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,920
You know this evening you can have faith that's growing exceedingly as you get into the Bible

446
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,160
There's been a read about what God has done and about what God is able to do

447
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,839
Our God is able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think

448
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:50,960
Consider that simple promise of Ephesians 3 and verse 20 and allow it to sink in tonight when you begin to read throughout the

449
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,520
The Bible and you read of these great works of God and the

450
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,559
Demonstrations of God's power it is designed so that you

451
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,920
Would have faith that would grow so that my faith would grow so that I would recognize my God is able

452
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,520
How many times has God put his people in situations that were difficult that were?

453
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,640
Challenging that seemed as if there was no way out

454
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,080
but God

455
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,960
You read those words in Scripture so often, but God

456
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,839
Because something changed God showed up. God did something miraculous

457
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,520
I begin to think about the Apostle Paul in Acts 27 as they're there and they're traveling and they're dealing with a

458
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,160
Storm that is contrary and they're tossed to and fro

459
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,240
They don't see stars nor Sun nor moon for days and all hope that they should be saved is gone

460
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
I mean they are in a a

461
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,839
Terrible storm

462
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
But God speaks to Paul

463
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,279
And God tells Paul that they're gonna be delivered

464
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
God tells Paul that everyone on board is going to be saved

465
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,279
God tells Paul

466
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,000
this message and Paul stands up and simply declares I

467
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
believe God I

468
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,679
believe God

469
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,279
This evening this church in Thyatira their faith was growing because the Bible says that

470
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,559
there at the end that the last to be more than the first and we see that they're growing in works and

471
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,320
Charity and service and faith and then notice finally number five. It says and thy

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
patience and thy patience this word patience is

473
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,640
Defined and often translated dealing with our English idea of steadfastness

474
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,359
can

475
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,880
constancy and

476
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,200
Endurance. I want you to think about the the word patience with regard to that

477
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,119
understanding of definition of being steadfast of of being constant of

478
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Enduring through trials. I

479
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Heard someone say years ago, what does it take to stop you?

480
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,960
The reality is that as God's people

481
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,640
We're to continue to go forward we're to continue to to do what God has called us to do and we see this

482
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,320
steadfastness that is mentioned this patience

483
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,239
Endurance and constancy look at first Thessalonians. Sorry, excuse me first Corinthians chapter 15 and

484
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,359
Ronnie challenged me last week on this verse of Scripture and you know, Ronnie. He's a he's got a

485
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:44,600
Way of just kind of asking you a question and saying here's what he did to him

486
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,679
He said hey first Corinthians 1558. Do you know it tell it to me?

487
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,320
As we did right after the service last week and I was like, okay, let me see. Yep. Got it

488
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,119
And you know, I mean I was completely in a different gear and everything but this verse of Scripture is so powerful

489
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:12,559
Therefore, my beloved brethren," notice what he says, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

490
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,419
in the work of the Lord.

491
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:22,759
And then notice what he says, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain

492
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,059
in the Lord.

493
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,159
They're being steadfast, their patience is being recognized, their constancy, their endurance.

494
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:39,499
And we find that as Paul writes to the church in Corinth, he says, listen brethren, I mean

495
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:44,099
1 Corinthians 15 is the great resurrection chapter.

496
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:50,099
And he concludes the section dealing with this mortal shall put on immortality and this

497
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,699
corruption shall put on incorruption.

498
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:58,139
And he deals with this great climactic passage of scripture with the resurrection and how

499
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:03,099
wonderful it is that we are going to be changed in a moment.

500
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:10,339
And he says, therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

501
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:11,379
in the work of the Lord.

502
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:17,179
For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

503
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:20,839
You know, there are times in which you can feel like, is it even working?

504
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,839
Is it even doing?

505
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,399
Listen, no, it is working.

506
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,399
God is at work.

507
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,519
God does use his word.

508
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,479
I met with someone this past week, and as I was chatting with them, and they shared

509
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:38,279
a, not a huge measure of discouragement, but a desire and an uncertainty whether or not

510
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,439
they've made any difference.

511
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:44,479
And I said, listen, if you've shared the word of God with them, you can rest assured that

512
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,479
God will use his word.

513
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:54,259
It may not be in your timing, it may not be in my timing, but God will use his word.

514
00:31:54,259 --> 00:32:01,639
And we must understand that we are to be steadfast, we're to have that patience that is spoken

515
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:09,879
of in the church in Thyatira, that constancy, that endurance, that faithfulness.

516
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:16,339
I'm reminded of what is said to the, in Galatians chapter 6 to those churches in the region

517
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:17,339
of Galatia.

518
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,779
By the way, that was the first missionary journey these churches are written to.

519
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,879
I'm not going to tell you all of them, Fernando, because you're supposed to study it.

520
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:29,699
But the reality is that in Galatians 6 and verse number 9, the Bible says this, and let

521
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:35,179
us not be weary in what?

522
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:37,259
In well-doing.

523
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,940
For in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

524
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,779
Listen, we like it when the reaping comes.

525
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,860
But you know when the reaping comes?

526
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,459
After the sowing.

527
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:52,979
Amen?

528
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:54,379
After the labor.

529
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:55,500
I've never been a farmer.

530
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,619
I don't think I'm ever going to be a farmer.

531
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:01,539
But the reality is that there's a whole lot of work that a farmer does before he ever

532
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,699
gets to the reaping.

533
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:06,979
The reaping is kind of the enjoyable part.

534
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:13,139
By the way, we enjoy it when God allows us to reap souls, when we see fruit, we have

535
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:17,459
that opportunity to share the gospel and see somebody trust Christ as their Savior.

536
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,739
What a blessing that is.

537
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:23,220
But oftentimes it's breaking up the fallow ground.

538
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:31,500
Oftentimes it's plowing through the hard-hearted individuals in their stony ground, so to speak,

539
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,019
and dealing with all of that.

540
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:41,019
But God says that we're not to be weary in well-doing, that we're to have that faith

541
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:48,819
and that expectation of reaping and understanding that God is at work.

542
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:55,339
Unfortunately, as we look at the church in Thyatira, it doesn't end here, it continues.

543
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:59,379
And he says in verse number 20, and it'll be our text for next week or next time, because

544
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:04,459
next week we have a missionary, but in verse number 20, notwithstanding, I have a few things

545
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,899
against thee.

546
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:12,779
And let me just say this, they're heavy things that God has against the church at Thyatira.

547
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,819
And here's the reality.

548
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:19,540
Here's the reality tonight, and I'll mention it when we finish and pick back up with this

549
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,540
message on Thyatira, but it's important to note it this evening.

550
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,619
God examines every part.

551
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:38,000
And God sees this good, but it doesn't mean that He ignores the bad.

552
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,380
Because He's the one, according to verse 18, that has eyes like unto a flame of fire, and

553
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,419
His feet are like fine brass.

554
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:51,239
And He says you're doing this good, these things are growing, but I have some things

555
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,019
against you.

556
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:57,100
Because you've got some problems, and they're major problems in the church at Thyatira.

557
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,919
I mean major significant problems that God says if you don't deal with it, you're going

558
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:05,979
to face serious punishment.

559
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,199
And what is the goal this evening?

560
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:14,179
The goal is to have that balanced ministry that I spoke of by way of introduction tonight.

561
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:19,799
That we understand that God is going to evaluate and examine every part.

562
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,459
That we must understand the importance of, yes, we need to do these things, but at the

563
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:27,639
same time we have to maintain doctrinal integrity.

564
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:32,600
At the same time of doing the works and growing in our faith and all that we're doing and

565
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,059
seeing new people added to a church and growing and discipling, that we cannot compromise

566
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,619
on the doctrine.

567
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,500
It's so vitally important that there's balance.

568
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,799
And can I say it this way?

569
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:51,299
It's so challenging.

570
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:55,979
That's why we see in these letters to the churches where so often there's some good

571
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:59,979
things and then there's some not so good things.

572
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:05,059
And you know it in your own life personally as you're seeking to walk with God and please

573
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,059
God.

574
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,059
There are areas you say, man, I did pretty good in this area, but man, I'm suffering

575
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,059
over here.

576
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,779
And then we put some attention over here, and then we're struggling over here.

577
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:20,380
And it's this constant battle of consistency in the Christian life.

578
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:25,139
The church in Thyatira, for the main subject that we're dealing with this evening, they

579
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,979
are commended for their growth in these areas in which they are growing.

580
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:35,220
Oh, that God would help us, even as we evaluate our own lives personally and evaluate our

581
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,820
church corporately, we'd have to ask ourselves the question, are we growing?

582
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,859
We know that we're supposed to be.

583
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,500
The question is not are we supposed to be growing?

584
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,260
The question is, are we growing?

585
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,500
Is my faith growing?

586
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,820
Is my service growing?

587
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,299
My works, my charity, my patience, is it growing?

588
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,299
Let's pray together.

589
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,299
Father, we love You.

590
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,299
We thank You for loving us.

591
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,519
Thank You for the day.

592
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,619
Thank You for the blessings.

593
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,579
We thank You for Your Word.

594
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,220
I pray, Father, that You would help us to evaluate and examine our own lives individually

595
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,540
and corporately as a church.

596
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,419
And Lord, help us to please You.

597
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,000
We want to have balance in ministry.

598
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,440
We want to be doing what You've called us to do, pleasing You in every area of our lives

599
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
and our ministry.

600
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,559
I pray, Father, in this moment of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

601
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,600
I pray, God, that You would move in hearts and lives as only You can.

602
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,899
And Lord, I pray that You'd bless the remainder of the evening with regard to the Bible quiz

603
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,399
and also the birthday fellowship.

604
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:37,119
I pray that You'd have Your will and way through all of those things and we'll thank You for

605
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,440
it in Christ's name we pray.

606
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,679
Would You stand with me?

607
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,040
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

608
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,720
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

609
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,639
As she does, the altar is open.
