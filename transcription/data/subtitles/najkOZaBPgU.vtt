00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
to Revelation chapter number two.

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.400
And this evening, as you see in the bulletin,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.880
as I mentioned at the close of the service this morning,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.880
we'll be dealing with the church at Thyatira,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.079
but only the first aspect of the church.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.640
And we'll look at just a couple of verses this evening.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.000
The city of Thyatira was a relatively small city,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.959
but it was wealthy.

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.559
And they were well known for several different things,

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.440
but most, I guess, famous, if you will.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.119
They were known for their wool and for their dyeing industry.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.080
And Acts 16 and verse 14, we're told about Lydia.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.000
And she was a seller of purple,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.959
and she was from the city of Thyatira.

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:42.959
And we read about that in Acts 16 and verse 14.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.720
It gives us a little bit of insight

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.779
with regard to some of the commercial trade

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.000
and what they were very well known for.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.479
The city was located approximately 35 miles

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.000
southeast of Pergamos.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880
Of course, we dealt with, last Sunday evening,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
the message to the church at Pergamos.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.759
We find that the Lord, as we begin studying

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.080
this particular letter to the church at Thyatira,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.120
once again, is going to emphasize a particular aspect

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.199
about his nature to this church.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:12.120
In verse 18, the Bible says,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.839
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write,

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.000
these things saith the Son of God,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800
who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.959
and his feet are like fine brass.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.660
And really, that reminds us of what had been said

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.099
in chapter one, verses 14 and 15.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.860
And when we see these two references,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.620
to his eyes like unto a flame of fire,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.459
and his feet are like fine brass,

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.980
it reminds us that he sees all and he judges all.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.180
And there is nothing hidden from our God.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.059
There's nothing in your life, my life,

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:49.139
or anyone else's life that is hidden from God.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.080
As much as man has tried to cover their sin,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.059
as much as man has tried to hide things from God,

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:57.339
the reality is that God knows all things.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:00.620
God knows the thoughts of your heart, of my heart.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.339
And we are reminded that not only does he see all,

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:04.779
but he judges all.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:07.900
He is the judge of the entire earth.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.899
We find that as we look at this letter

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.380
to the church in Thyatira,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.100
it is this letter that is the longest

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580
of the seven letters that we read

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.660
in Revelation 2 and Revelation 3.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.979
And we find that with the length of this letter,

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.059
that's one of the reasons

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.740
that we're only gonna focus tonight

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:26.899
on just a couple of the verses,

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.539
because we'll have a multi-part

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.100
as we try to make our way through this particular letter.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.940
It's very interesting as we've studied

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.500
through these letters up to this point,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.740
and I'll say it my way of introduction,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.839
we begin to think about a church under the evaluation,

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.259
the examination of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.779
who is the head of the church.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.339
We find that he's examining,

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.399
he's evaluating the ministries

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.839
of these particular churches.

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.000
Of course, we understand that they are literal churches

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.119
that existed at the time of the writing.

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.160
They are local bodies of believers.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.880
And we find that as he would go through the process

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.880
of having these letters sent

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.039
and evaluating the ministry,

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.559
that you find many times,

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.600
and it's quite interesting

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.720
as we look at the church in Thyatira,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.679
that there's really almost a direct opposite

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.000
with what you find here in the church at Thyatira

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.059
versus the church in Ephesus.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.699
We find that the church in Ephesus was,

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.699
they could not, they would not allow for any type of evil.

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.020
They were very sound

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.779
with regard to their doctrine and what have you,

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.660
but they had left their first love.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.860
They had departed from their first works.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.820
And yet we find the church in Thyatira

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.339
where they're growing in their works

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.539
and they're being commended for these things,

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.779
but yet doctrinal error is coming in.

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.220
When we begin to think about these things

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.979
as you look through these letters,

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.539
we really are reminded that the goal in ministry

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.339
is to be balanced.

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.740
And how important it is that we're balanced

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.779
in our own lives individually in our homes,

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.500
but in our churches,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.600
where we have the right position and the right disposition.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.820
We believe the right thing and we behave the right way.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.299
We are doing what God's called us to do

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.100
while holding firm to the truth that God has given to us.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.380
And so often, as I mentioned last week,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.739
with regard to the temptation for compromise,

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:32.500
so often there's some area that we begin to falter in

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.820
and we might keep things going well here

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.739
and we're staying sound here, but we're compromising here.

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:41.299
And there's this need for balance in ministry

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:44.399
and that we understand that everything is important.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.660
There's not certain things to say,

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.339
we're just gonna focus on these things

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:49.679
and let all these things slide.

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:51.579
We're gonna find ourselves in trouble.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.899
And we find here this evening that as the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.420
is having this letter written to the church in Thyatira,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.380
he says in verse 19, as we have noted

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.220
in each of these letters, I know thy works.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.019
Notice with me the entirety of verse 19.

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:12.440
He says, I know thy works and charity and service and faith

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.059
and thy patience and thy works.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.500
He says it a second time.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.179
And notice this last phrase of verse number 19

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:22.660
and the last to be more than the first.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.779
As we begin to examine that phrase at the end of verse 19,

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.339
it would seem as if the Lord is saying to this church

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.299
in these five areas that are mentioned in verse 19

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:35.700
that they were growing, that they were progressing

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.899
in these particular areas because he says

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.619
that the last is more than the first.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.779
It's interesting because again, as I mentioned already

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.579
to the church at Ephesus, in verse number five

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.119
of chapter two, the Bible says, remember therefore

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.940
from whence thou art fallen and repent.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.579
And notice where it says, and do the first works

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.220
or else I will come unto thee quickly

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.399
and will remove thy candlestick out of his place

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.179
except thou repent.

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.600
As we look at the church in Thyatira, he says,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.619
I know thy works and charity and service and faith

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:12.000
and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.200
than the first.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.040
The reality is that God's people are to be growing.

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:18.200
Amen?

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.019
We're to grow.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:21.200
The Bible teaches us as newborn babes,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.920
desire the sincere milk of the word

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.399
that ye may grow thereby.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.700
Is that what first Peter two verse number two says?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.799
When Peter writes in second Peter chapter three

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:34.380
in verse 18, but grow in grace and knowledge

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.399
of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.679
And the Christian life is about growth.

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:41.959
And the thing that's amazing about the Christian life

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:45.399
is that your growth and my growth is not going

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.720
to be restricted to some growth chart

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.239
that somebody provides.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.519
No, we understand that we can grow as quickly

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.359
as we wanna grow.

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:57.959
We can be as close to God as we wanna be.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.480
We can be as spiritual as we wanna be.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.760
And the reality is that as Paul is writing

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.559
to the believers in the book of Hebrews,

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.079
he tells us for in the time that you ought to be teachers.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.279
Why does he use that phraseology in Hebrews five

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.480
in verse number 12?

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.799
Because they should have been growing.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.559
For in the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.119
he says to them, you have need that one teach you again,

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.559
which be the first principles of the oracles of God

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.839
and are become such as have need of milk

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.239
and not of strong meat.

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:35.059
And so what is Paul saying to these believers

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:36.760
that he's addressing in the book of Hebrews?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.320
He's saying to them, you ought to be growing,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.420
but you're not.

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:45.720
And so growth is expected in the Christian life.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.399
Is that a fair statement this evening?

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:51.480
Growth is expected in the Christian life.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.480
If the church is a body of believers,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.040
if the church, it's not the building, it's the people,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.799
the church is a called out assembly.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:03.420
And if the church is made up of individual saved

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.399
and baptized believers who have voluntarily

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.359
joined themselves together for the carrying out

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:11.880
of the great commission, if that is a simple definition

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.239
this evening of the church, the local church,

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:17.299
and we believe that as Christians were to be growing,

00:08:17.299 --> 00:08:19.440
then we could easily say this tonight

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.519
that churches should be growing.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.200
Churches should be growing.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.119
Here's one of the problems with growth.

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:30.540
There's been such an emphasis over the last couple

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.359
of generations with regard to church growth

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:36.520
being strictly numerical.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.239
And there's this numerical focus and emphasis

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:40.080
on church growth.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.320
Let me be quick to say this,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.039
I'm all for the church growing numerically.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.719
It means that you're reaching people.

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:48.479
It means that you're investing in people

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:50.880
and I'm all for the church growing numerically,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.880
but the reality is that a church needs

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.119
to be growing spiritually.

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:59.559
It's not one or the other, it should be both.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.840
A church should be growing numerically

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.520
and a church should be growing spiritually.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.799
And it's so important when we understand the truth

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:09.099
of the great commission when the Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:12.000
before his ascension, he gives the great commission

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.880
in its most detailed setting in Matthew chapter 28

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.320
and he lays out three aspects with regard

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.200
to the great commission, not only preaching the gospel

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.280
so that people could be saved, not only baptizing them

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.440
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.119
but teaching them to observe all things whatsoever

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:34.320
I have commanded you and we find that that third aspect

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.320
of discipleship is so vital for a local church.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.479
And so a church ought to be growing.

00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:44.880
The church in Thyatira, as we look at verse number 19,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.400
it seems as if they're growing

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.400
and we'll reference these five areas.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.020
Another church that we find in the New Testament

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.479
that will be referenced a couple of times this evening

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:57.080
that was a growing church is the church in Thessalonica.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.039
And that church is growing.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:09:59.880
It's quite.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.840
First thing is you study 1st and 2nd Thessalonians and you make some very obvious comparisons

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.240
between the two books and you see that the Bible speaks about how they're growing.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.040
In fact, your faith groweth exceedingly.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.040
What a blessing to be hearing those words and to be the reality of a church that is

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.160
growing in that regard.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.120
And so this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture we note these five areas.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.700
Note them with me quickly.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.920
Number one, they were growing in works.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.740
Now understand this evening, and it's a Sunday night so I believe that we'd all be aware

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.540
of this truth already, but it's important to make it known.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.500
The reality is that works cannot save us.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.860
Amen?

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.500
Works cannot save us.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.340
Not only can they not save us, but they can't keep us saved.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.060
Not by works of righteousness which we have done.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.060
For by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.060
God.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.420
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.260
And we find that even as we study the Scriptures and as Brianna sang that song this morning

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:14.640
and I referenced it from the truth from Isaiah, that all of our good works are as filthy rags.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.620
But the reality is that after we're saved, when we read Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.460
and 9 which I quoted a minute ago, the Bible goes on to say that we are His workmanship

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:34.060
created in Christ Jesus and the Bible says this, unto good works which God hath before

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.540
ordained that we should walk in them.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.540
In what?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.540
In the good works.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.060
Again, as you study the book of Ephesians and that's Ephesians chapter 2 and verse

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.980
number 10, it's very clear throughout the six chapters in the book of Ephesians that

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:57.300
our works have nothing to do with our standing before God as far as being saved.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.900
Our position is secure in Christ.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.140
We're saved by the grace of God, by the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, His death,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.380
burial, and resurrection.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.860
But because we are saved, we ought to do good works.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.779
We ought to be involved in this area of works.

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:21.260
Titus chapter 2 says this, in fact if you were to study through the three chapters in

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.220
the book of Titus, there's emphasis with regard to works.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:31.020
But notice Titus 2, the Bible says this in verse number 11, Titus chapter 2 and verse

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.139
number 11, for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:38.900
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.779
I'm thankful that God's grace and it brings salvation, that it's appeared to all men.

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:50.020
And then notice what God's grace teaches us according to verse 12, teaching us that denying

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:56.980
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.820
world.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.860
Then notice verse 13, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.220
God and our Savior Jesus Christ.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.139
Think about the summary of these three verses, that the grace of God that brings salvation

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:16.740
appeared to all men and it teaches us how we're to live our lives.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.860
This idea in Jude where they've turned the grace of God into lasciviousness is completely

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.460
contrary to what we find the Bible teaching us in Titus 2 in verse number 12.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.779
God's grace does not say go out and sin because where sin abounds, grace is more.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.380
No, it says that we're to live godly.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:42.100
We find that He says that we're to look for the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.980
and I'm so thankful that one day He's coming back.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:53.180
But notice with me in verse 14, who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.100
and purify unto Himself a peculiar people.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.340
Notice what they're to be zealous of, zealous of good works.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.559
The book of James is often misunderstood because in the book of James there are many

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:12.620
references with regard to good works and our works and you say that you have faith and

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:18.580
show me your works and all of the verses of Scripture that deal with works and I've said

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.739
before and I think it's an easy understanding that what James is focusing on is not the

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:29.940
root of salvation but he's dealing with the fruit of salvation.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:38.100
Because I'm saved, I am His workmanship created in Christ Jesus and here we find that the

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.260
Lord says to the church in Thyatira, I know thy works and then He says again at the end

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.339
after He lists the next things, He says and thy works.

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:49.540
They're busy serving the Lord.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.459
Their service is mentioned in a moment and we'll look at that here as we go through it

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:56.000
but we find they're growing in works.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.339
Number two, they're growing in charity.

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:03.420
Notice it says I know thy works and charity.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.540
Oh, how important it is that we love people but you understand this evening that loving

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:15.080
people cannot be separated from telling people the truth.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.300
So often today the idea is that if you love them or because you love them then you just

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:25.619
kind of accept whatever and let it all be what it wants to be because well, that's just

00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:26.619
love.

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:32.020
But the reality is that love speaks the truth.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.220
And we find in the scriptures the importance of growing in charity.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:42.020
We understand the importance of loving God and loving people and we understand that we're

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:49.020
to love our brethren and we're to have that brotherly love one for another and the Bible

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:54.580
says that God knows their works and He knows their charity and the reality is that God

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.559
knows our works and He knows our charity.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:03.500
Look over the book of 1 Thessalonians if you will and chapter number four and 1 Thessalonians

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:12.300
chapter number four and I want you to note with me what is said about the church in Thessalonica

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.619
with regard to their love.

00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:21.140
And notice with me if you will in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four verses nine and ten the

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.420
Bible says this, but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you for

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.000
ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed you do it toward all the

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.020
brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.020
and more.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.179
And so we find that the church in Thessalonica is being encouraged, they're being challenged

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:48.380
and they're love one for another and Paul says I know that you're doing it but don't

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.420
be content, don't get comfortable, increase.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:17:02.059
Notice in Romans chapter twelve, in Romans chapter number twelve in verse number nine,

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:06.420
Romans chapter twelve in verse number nine and I want you to notice what the Bible says

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:14.540
here and Romans twelve in verse number nine, let love be without dissimulation, let love

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.020
be without dissimulation.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.739
The reality is that when we speak about our love it's to be a love that is sincere, without

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:28.179
hypocrisy and we find that he says not only and it's interesting in the same verse of

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:34.700
scripture let love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.700
is good.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.220
Love speaks the truth and it must speak the truth.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.179
The reality is that if you're not speaking the truth to someone while at the same time

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:55.100
saying that you're loving that person there's a disconnect between those two comments.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.739
There's a problem with that because love speaks the truth and here they're growing in their

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:03.899
works, they're growing in their charity.

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:08.779
Number three it says end service, end service.

00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:12.820
What a blessing it is to serve the Lord and we spoke already about their work so I won't

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.179
belabor the point but look at first Peter chapter four if you will, first Peter chapter

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:21.179
number four and I want you to notice what the Bible says here in first Peter chapter

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:26.220
four verses ten and eleven with regard to our service.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:32.299
I was, had some conversations today actually with a couple of different sets of people

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:37.900
and in both of, two of the conversations that I had I mentioned about our service for the

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.539
Lord and one of them in particular I mentioned about the truth of Joshua standing up and

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:48.940
saying as for me and my house we will what?

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.739
Serve the Lord.

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:56.500
Now listen Joshua didn't say that so that in 2025 it could be marketed all over the

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.099
place to be hung in your home and my home.

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:03.660
He said that because he was drawing a line in the sand and he was saying listen choose

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.140
you this day whom you're going to serve.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.299
How are you going to go, how are you going to go forward?

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:10.299
What are you going to do?

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:13.780
Are you going to serve the gods of the people in the land?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.140
Are you going to serve the gods that they served before the flood?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.820
What are you going to do?

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.539
As for me and my house we are going to serve the Lord.

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:26.140
So then we ask this question, what does it mean to serve the Lord?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.739
How do we serve the Lord?

00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:29.479
Why should we serve the Lord?

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:31.979
How do we serve the Lord together as a family?

00:19:31.979 --> 00:19:38.559
How do we serve the Lord in a time in which things are so busy and there's so many demands

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:44.299
upon our lives and going to and fro and all that's taking place and yet we find that this

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.140
church in Thyatira they're serving the Lord.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.140
Notice in 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse number 10 the Bible says as every man hath received

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.140
the gift.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.140
How many have received the gift?

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.320
Is anyone excluded?

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320
If you're saved.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:00.320


00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.880
If you're here and you're saved that means you've received a gift

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.520
Amen, and it's not simply talking about the gift of salvation. Although that's a wonderful gift

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.400
It's the gift of God, which is eternal life. But here he's talking about spiritual gifts

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.360
He talks to the church in Corinth. He talks in Romans

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.220
About the spiritual gifts and he says as every man hath received the gift notice even so

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.720
minister the same one to another

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.000
And then notice how he refers to this

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.960
This service or this ministry. He says as good stewards of the manifold grace of God

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.680
The Bible tells us in 1st Corinthians chapter 2 that it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.120
and the reality is that God has been faithful and God has been gracious to give to us a

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.080
spiritual gift and to impart to us grace and

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.960
Then he says to us as the individual believers that we are to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.080
What are we doing with what God has entrusted us with?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:14.200
How are we using our talents and our gifts for the honor and glory of God verse 11?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.080
if any man speak

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.680
Let him speak as the oracles of God

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.900
If any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.800
That God and all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.440
forever and ever

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.760
Amen, here's a wonderful couple of truths from verse number 11

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.000
The Bible says that we're to serve God with our spiritual gift

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.600
We're not to serve in such a way that we are to receive glory

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.640
No, we're to serve so that he would receive the glory

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.920
He says that if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.800
God is going to require of us based upon the ability that he has given to us and

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.080
Yes, it is our responsibility to develop that to

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.920
You know try to come to that place where we are

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.760
Using and developing and being the best that we can be for the glory of God

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.000
but the reality is it's all for the glory of God and

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.480
He says to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.400
Amen

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.040
You know when we serve the Lord

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.040
It's so that God would be glorified

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:37.960
Because if I recognize this evening that it's God who has enabled me if you recognize this evening that it's God who has enabled

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.520
You and God who has gifted you and you're using it for the honor and glory of God

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.040
Then when man applauds you simply reflect or deflect and say no to God be the glory

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:54.600
Because without him truly as John as Jesus said in John without him I can do nothing

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.080
The same is true of you this evening. You say but let me tell you about all the talents that I have

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.880
Listen, let me tell you about the fact that God gave them to you

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.320
Amen

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.080
God gave them to us

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.300
And so we see that this church is growing in their works and their charity in their service

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.740
Notice the Bible says back in Revelation 2 in verse 19 as he goes through this process of listing this out. He says and

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.940
Faith, I want you to think about faith just for a moment this evening

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.860
The reality is that the Bible tells us repeatedly that the just shall live by

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:41.040
Faith right. So what the Bible says the just shall live by faith. The Bible says that without faith it is

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.720
Impossible to please God in

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:50.160
Hebrews 11 in verse number 6 for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.800
Rewarder of them that diligently seek him

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.120
We have the entirety of Hebrews chapter 11 that talks about by faith

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:05.560
This person did this and by faith this person did this and really all that's taking place is the individuals that are mentioned in Hebrews

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.960
chapter 11

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.960
Believed what God said

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.040
Faith is an action. They took God at his word. They stepped out by faith

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.320
Abraham went to a land that he did not know why because he believed God he had faith

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.279
Noah built an ark that he did not know anything about with regard to rain and so on and so forth

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.279
But he believed God

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.600
In this evening as we begin to look at this idea of our faith and we understand the importance of having

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.720
Faith and growing in our faith. How does our faith grow?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200
Well, you know the answer

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:47.360
Romans chapter number 10, so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.640
You know how your faith grows, you know how my faith grows

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.559
It's through getting into the Bible and getting the Bible into us and we begin to learn

00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:59.240
About the character and nature of our God we begin to see

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.240
What our God has done and what he's capable of doing and all of a sudden it begins to increase our faith

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:10.960
It grows our faith. Have you ever heard somebody say well, I don't have their kind of faith

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720
Where did they get that faith?

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:17.520
They got the faith by being in the book

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:25.000
This evening we read about the church and Thessalonica. I mentioned that we'd reference them twice look in second Thessalonians

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:31.559
Chapter number one and I want you to notice what the Bible says here in second Thessalonians chapter number one

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.440
What a what a statement that's made about the church in Thessalonica

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.880
With regard to their faith

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.440
In second Thessalonians 1 in verse 3 the Bible says we are bound

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.640
To thank God always for you brethren as it is meat

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.360
Notice this because that your faith

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.200
groweth

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.240
Exceedingly

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:01.279
The

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.480
Charity of every one of you all toward each other

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.360
Aboundeth we mentioned in the second point this evening of the church in Thyatira about their charity in here

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.679
We find that even in the church of Thessalonica after they were encouraged in the first

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.200
Letter in chapter 4 to increase more and more that the Bible says that their charity is abounding

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.440
But it says that their faith is growing exceedingly

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:32.920
You know this evening you can have faith that's growing exceedingly as you get into the Bible

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.160
There's been a read about what God has done and about what God is able to do

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.839
Our God is able to exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:50.960
Consider that simple promise of Ephesians 3 and verse 20 and allow it to sink in tonight when you begin to read throughout the

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.520
The Bible and you read of these great works of God and the

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.559
Demonstrations of God's power it is designed so that you

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:06.920
Would have faith that would grow so that my faith would grow so that I would recognize my God is able

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:13.520
How many times has God put his people in situations that were difficult that were?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.640
Challenging that seemed as if there was no way out

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.080
but God

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.960
You read those words in Scripture so often, but God

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.839
Because something changed God showed up. God did something miraculous

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:35.520
I begin to think about the Apostle Paul in Acts 27 as they're there and they're traveling and they're dealing with a

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:40.160
Storm that is contrary and they're tossed to and fro

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.240
They don't see stars nor Sun nor moon for days and all hope that they should be saved is gone

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.240
I mean they are in a a

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:50.839
Terrible storm

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.559
But God speaks to Paul

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:58.279
And God tells Paul that they're gonna be delivered

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.960
God tells Paul that everyone on board is going to be saved

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:06.279
God tells Paul

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:11.000
this message and Paul stands up and simply declares I

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.960
believe God I

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.679
believe God

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:23.279
This evening this church in Thyatira their faith was growing because the Bible says that

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:29.559
there at the end that the last to be more than the first and we see that they're growing in works and

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.320
Charity and service and faith and then notice finally number five. It says and thy

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.559
patience and thy patience this word patience is

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:46.640
Defined and often translated dealing with our English idea of steadfastness

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.359
can

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:50.880
constancy and

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.200
Endurance. I want you to think about the the word patience with regard to that

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.119
understanding of definition of being steadfast of of being constant of

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.520
Enduring through trials. I

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.720
Heard someone say years ago, what does it take to stop you?

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:14.960
The reality is that as God's people

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:22.640
We're to continue to go forward we're to continue to to do what God has called us to do and we see this

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.320
steadfastness that is mentioned this patience

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.239
Endurance and constancy look at first Thessalonians. Sorry, excuse me first Corinthians chapter 15 and

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.359
Ronnie challenged me last week on this verse of Scripture and you know, Ronnie. He's a he's got a

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:44.600
Way of just kind of asking you a question and saying here's what he did to him

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.679
He said hey first Corinthians 1558. Do you know it tell it to me?

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.320
As we did right after the service last week and I was like, okay, let me see. Yep. Got it

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:00.119
And you know, I mean I was completely in a different gear and everything but this verse of Scripture is so powerful

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:12.559
Therefore, my beloved brethren," notice what he says, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.419
in the work of the Lord.

00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:22.759
And then notice what he says, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:26.059
in the Lord.

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:33.159
They're being steadfast, their patience is being recognized, their constancy, their endurance.

00:30:33.159 --> 00:30:39.499
And we find that as Paul writes to the church in Corinth, he says, listen brethren, I mean

00:30:39.499 --> 00:30:44.099
1 Corinthians 15 is the great resurrection chapter.

00:30:44.099 --> 00:30:50.099
And he concludes the section dealing with this mortal shall put on immortality and this

00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:52.699
corruption shall put on incorruption.

00:30:52.699 --> 00:30:58.139
And he deals with this great climactic passage of scripture with the resurrection and how

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:03.099
wonderful it is that we are going to be changed in a moment.

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:10.339
And he says, therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:11.379
in the work of the Lord.

00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:17.179
For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:20.839
You know, there are times in which you can feel like, is it even working?

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:21.839
Is it even doing?

00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:23.399
Listen, no, it is working.

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:24.399
God is at work.

00:31:24.399 --> 00:31:26.519
God does use his word.

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:30.479
I met with someone this past week, and as I was chatting with them, and they shared

00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:38.279
a, not a huge measure of discouragement, but a desire and an uncertainty whether or not

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:39.439
they've made any difference.

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:44.479
And I said, listen, if you've shared the word of God with them, you can rest assured that

00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:47.479
God will use his word.

00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:54.259
It may not be in your timing, it may not be in my timing, but God will use his word.

00:31:54.259 --> 00:32:01.639
And we must understand that we are to be steadfast, we're to have that patience that is spoken

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:09.879
of in the church in Thyatira, that constancy, that endurance, that faithfulness.

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:16.339
I'm reminded of what is said to the, in Galatians chapter 6 to those churches in the region

00:32:16.339 --> 00:32:17.339
of Galatia.

00:32:18.199 --> 00:32:20.779
By the way, that was the first missionary journey these churches are written to.

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:23.879
I'm not going to tell you all of them, Fernando, because you're supposed to study it.

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:29.699
But the reality is that in Galatians 6 and verse number 9, the Bible says this, and let

00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:35.179
us not be weary in what?

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:37.259
In well-doing.

00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:42.940
For in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.779
Listen, we like it when the reaping comes.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.860
But you know when the reaping comes?

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.459
After the sowing.

00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:52.979
Amen?

00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:54.379
After the labor.

00:32:54.379 --> 00:32:55.500
I've never been a farmer.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.619
I don't think I'm ever going to be a farmer.

00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:01.539
But the reality is that there's a whole lot of work that a farmer does before he ever

00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:03.699
gets to the reaping.

00:33:03.699 --> 00:33:06.979
The reaping is kind of the enjoyable part.

00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:13.139
By the way, we enjoy it when God allows us to reap souls, when we see fruit, we have

00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:17.459
that opportunity to share the gospel and see somebody trust Christ as their Savior.

00:33:17.459 --> 00:33:19.739
What a blessing that is.

00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:23.220
But oftentimes it's breaking up the fallow ground.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:31.500
Oftentimes it's plowing through the hard-hearted individuals in their stony ground, so to speak,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.019
and dealing with all of that.

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:41.019
But God says that we're not to be weary in well-doing, that we're to have that faith

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:48.819
and that expectation of reaping and understanding that God is at work.

00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:55.339
Unfortunately, as we look at the church in Thyatira, it doesn't end here, it continues.

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:59.379
And he says in verse number 20, and it'll be our text for next week or next time, because

00:33:59.379 --> 00:34:04.459
next week we have a missionary, but in verse number 20, notwithstanding, I have a few things

00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:05.899
against thee.

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:12.779
And let me just say this, they're heavy things that God has against the church at Thyatira.

00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:14.819
And here's the reality.

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:19.540
Here's the reality tonight, and I'll mention it when we finish and pick back up with this

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.540
message on Thyatira, but it's important to note it this evening.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.619
God examines every part.

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:38.000
And God sees this good, but it doesn't mean that He ignores the bad.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.380
Because He's the one, according to verse 18, that has eyes like unto a flame of fire, and

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.419
His feet are like fine brass.

00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:51.239
And He says you're doing this good, these things are growing, but I have some things

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.019
against you.

00:34:53.019 --> 00:34:57.100
Because you've got some problems, and they're major problems in the church at Thyatira.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.919
I mean major significant problems that God says if you don't deal with it, you're going

00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:05.979
to face serious punishment.

00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:08.199
And what is the goal this evening?

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:14.179
The goal is to have that balanced ministry that I spoke of by way of introduction tonight.

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:19.799
That we understand that God is going to evaluate and examine every part.

00:35:19.799 --> 00:35:23.459
That we must understand the importance of, yes, we need to do these things, but at the

00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:27.639
same time we have to maintain doctrinal integrity.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:32.600
At the same time of doing the works and growing in our faith and all that we're doing and

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:39.059
seeing new people added to a church and growing and discipling, that we cannot compromise

00:35:39.059 --> 00:35:41.619
on the doctrine.

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:46.500
It's so vitally important that there's balance.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.799
And can I say it this way?

00:35:47.799 --> 00:35:51.299
It's so challenging.

00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:55.979
That's why we see in these letters to the churches where so often there's some good

00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:59.979
things and then there's some not so good things.

00:35:59.979 --> 00:36:05.059
And you know it in your own life personally as you're seeking to walk with God and please

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:06.059
God.

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:09.059
There are areas you say, man, I did pretty good in this area, but man, I'm suffering

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:10.059
over here.

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:12.779
And then we put some attention over here, and then we're struggling over here.

00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:20.380
And it's this constant battle of consistency in the Christian life.

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:25.139
The church in Thyatira, for the main subject that we're dealing with this evening, they

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:29.979
are commended for their growth in these areas in which they are growing.

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:35.220
Oh, that God would help us, even as we evaluate our own lives personally and evaluate our

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:40.820
church corporately, we'd have to ask ourselves the question, are we growing?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.859
We know that we're supposed to be.

00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:46.500
The question is not are we supposed to be growing?

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.260
The question is, are we growing?

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.500
Is my faith growing?

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.820
Is my service growing?

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.299
My works, my charity, my patience, is it growing?

00:36:58.299 --> 00:36:59.299
Let's pray together.

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:00.299
Father, we love You.

00:37:00.299 --> 00:37:01.299
We thank You for loving us.

00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:02.519
Thank You for the day.

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:03.619
Thank You for the blessings.

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:05.579
We thank You for Your Word.

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:10.220
I pray, Father, that You would help us to evaluate and examine our own lives individually

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.540
and corporately as a church.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.419
And Lord, help us to please You.

00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:15.000
We want to have balance in ministry.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.440
We want to be doing what You've called us to do, pleasing You in every area of our lives

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.440
and our ministry.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.559
I pray, Father, in this moment of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:27.600
I pray, God, that You would move in hearts and lives as only You can.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.899
And Lord, I pray that You'd bless the remainder of the evening with regard to the Bible quiz

00:37:31.899 --> 00:37:33.399
and also the birthday fellowship.

00:37:33.399 --> 00:37:37.119
I pray that You'd have Your will and way through all of those things and we'll thank You for

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.440
it in Christ's name we pray.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.679
Would You stand with me?

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:41.040
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.720
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.639
As she does, the altar is open.
