1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
you will, and in the book of Nehemiah, and looking at this portion of Scripture, Nehemiah

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,560
chapter number 4, and as we get to that passage of Scripture, I want to remind you of something

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,559
that the Apostle Paul said as he was ministering there to the believers in Corinth.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,280
Of course, we understand that God allowed the Apostle Paul to minister in Corinth for

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,840
an extended period of time, and during that time of ministry, a church was established,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,680
and then God would use Paul to write two letters back to this church, instructing

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,919
them with regard to their walk with the Lord, and of course, with various things within

8
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:42,919
the church, but Paul mentioned this in 1 Corinthians 16, in verse number 9, he said,

9
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:48,200
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and then he ends the verse by saying this,

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
And there are many adversaries.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
There are many adversaries, and this evening, I want to preach a message that I've entitled

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,119
There Are Many Adversaries, but we're going to look at Nehemiah chapter 4 with that thought

13
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,480
of what Paul said in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,160
The reality is that for most of us, it is easy to acknowledge that we have an enemy.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,080
The Bible declares that we have an enemy, and we understand that the enemy, that we

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,519
are engaged in spiritual battle, it's not flesh and blood that we wrestle against, but

17
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,239
spiritual wickedness in high places, and we understand that truth, and we understand that

18
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,319
throughout the scriptures, that the Lord has given us a number of accounts to help

19
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,279
us understand how the enemy operates.

20
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:41,360
As we have the opportunity to read much of the accounts, or many of the accounts, I should

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,639
say, in the Old Testament, that as we read those accounts, we have the opportunity to

22
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,699
get insight as to how the enemy is working.

23
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:56,019
It's not simply a lesson in history, though it contains an accurate historical record,

24
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:02,180
and as we look at the accuracy of the historical record, if we end there, we miss the spiritual

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,580
application, and so it's imperative for us to understand that God's not simply giving

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,020
us the history, though he is.

27
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,539
He's giving us truth to help us understand the way that the enemy operates, and really,

28
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:21,059
it enables us to be better equipped for the battle.

29
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:25,059
As we look at Nehemiah, we're going to be in chapter number four, and I want you to

30
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:30,380
understand some things that are taking place as we get into chapter number four this evening.

31
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,020
Obviously, we've not been studying through the book of Nehemiah, and we're jumping in

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,419
chapter number four, and so just briefly, I want to give you some information.

33
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,580
Nehemiah, of course, was not in Jerusalem at the beginning of the book.

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,160
As it's being written, the people of God had been carried captive already at this particular

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,740
time in their history.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,539
Of course, a remnant was returning under the decree of Cyrus, and we understand that as

37
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:02,259
we look at the passage of Scripture, that in the very first chapter, that God gives

38
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:08,779
us some insight as to the concern that Nehemiah has for his home country.

39
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:13,660
The reason we know that he's concerned is because he inquired, and he made inquiry as

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,300
to what was going on, and he received a report, and part of the report that he received, according

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,940
to Nehemiah 1 and verse number three, is that the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down,

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,020
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

43
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,220
As we go through the book of Nehemiah, we begin to see the work that is taking place

44
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,419
on rebuilding the walls.

45
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,860
We understand that it's in the second chapter that Nehemiah makes his petition, if you will,

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,059
to King Artaxerxes with regard to going and fulfilling the work that God had called him to.

47
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:51,539
We read in chapter number three, if you were to read the entirety of the chapter, you begin

48
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:56,660
to see how the rebuilding of the walls and the workers are assigned, and as you go through

49
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,339
the passage, you'll find at the beginning of verse number two, and many of the verses

50
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:07,460
thereafter will say, and next unto him, and then it will name some people, and they were

51
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,139
working on this part of the wall, on this particular gate, and then next unto him there

52
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,459
was this group of people, and so on and so forth, and so we kind of see what's happening.

53
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,140
Even before we get to the fourth chapter, at the end of chapter number two, we're made

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,420
aware of some of the opposition.

55
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,260
They're named by name at the end of chapter number two.

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,100
The Bible tells us in verse number 19, but when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the

57
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,660
servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised

58
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,260
us and said, what is this thing that ye do?

59
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,100
Will ye rebel against the king?

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,980
I love the response that is recorded for us in verse number 20.

61
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:57,220
It says, then answered I them and said unto them, the God of heaven, he will prosper us.

62
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,420
Don't you like the faith of Nehemiah?

63
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:08,820
He said, therefore, we his servants will arise and build, but ye have no portion, nor rite,

64
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,100
nor memorial in Jerusalem.

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,820
The workers are assigned, and we come to chapter number four, and the Bible begins in verse

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,040
number one, and it says this, it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that he builded

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:30,679
the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews.

68
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:35,720
As we enter into the fourth chapter, we find that the Bible would give us the record that

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,239
he, Nehemiah, is saying that the enemy, Sanballat in particular, that he heard that we builded

70
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,600
the wall.

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,640
Can I tell you that the enemy is content if we're not making progress?

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,320
You're not going to mess with us if we're not doing anything.

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,000
But when you try to do something for God, you begin to have some opposition.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You begin to deal with the enemy opposing the work of God.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,959
As you take notes this evening, I want you to consider first of all with me the plan

76
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,040
of the enemy.

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,839
We find that the enemy, the plan is revealed throughout the passage.

78
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,880
We'll go through a number of verses here.

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,320
You find that in verse number one, the Bible says that they mock the Jews.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,119
There are times in which the enemy will mock the people of God, will mock that which we're

81
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,200
seeking to do.

82
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,720
And we find that it says in verse number two, and he spake before his brethren in the army

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,399
of Samaria and said, what do these feeble Jews?

84
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,140
Will they fortify themselves?

85
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,320
Will they sacrifice?

86
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,079
Will they make an end in a day?

87
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,399
Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?

88
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,880
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him and he said, even that which they build, if a fox

89
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,640
go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Mocking them.

91
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,880
They're going to build a wall, but if a little fox were to climb upon it, it's going to fall.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,000
We see the enemy, they have a plan.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,880
Notice in verse number seven, as we continue to kind of dissect what's going on here, it

94
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,480
says it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites

95
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,279
and the Astrodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches

96
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,480
began to be stopped, notice, then they were very wroth.

97
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
So what do they do?

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,480
They conspired, all of them together, to come and to fight against Jerusalem.

99
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,200
Notice where it says, and to hinder it.

100
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Now it's interesting, as we note the progression that is made here, you find that the enemy

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,079
seeks to really discourage the work from even going forward.

102
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:49,119
The enemy seeks to come and mock and use the verbiage that is used here, these feeble Jews,

103
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,040
and talking about that even if they build it, if a fox were to go up on it, it's going

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,399
to break down their stone wall, and the enemy seeks to discourage us right on the onset

105
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,600
of even trying to do anything for God.

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,600
And when that discouragement doesn't cause the people of God to stop, we find that we

107
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,799
come to verse number seven and we see the plan further develop, because here's what

108
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,799
they heard.

109
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:18,799
They heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches, notice, began

110
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,059
to be stopped.

111
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,359
How did they respond?

112
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,200
Then they were very wroth.

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,440
So now they have to increase their attack.

114
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,320
They need to do something else.

115
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,679
They need to go to level two, if you will.

116
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:37,119
I mean, if the mocking and that verbal opposition that is recorded for us in the first three

117
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,559
verses, if that works, then the enemy doesn't even have to expound any energy, effort, they

118
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,679
don't need to come and fight, they don't need to do anything.

119
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,599
But we find that they heard that the work was going forward.

120
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:52,400
It wasn't complete, but it was going forward.

121
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
So guess what the enemy does?

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,700
We need to go to the next step.

123
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,599
We need to increase our attack.

124
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:01,400
And we find that they are conspiring, notice in verse number eight, all of them together

125
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,760
to come up and to fight against Jerusalem.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,119
It says, and to hinder it.

127
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:12,960
It's interesting as we move forward through the plan as it's revealed to us that yes,

128
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,919
the enemy wants to hinder the work, but their ultimate goal is not to simply hinder it.

129
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,099
They want the work to cease.

130
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:25,880
And we see that very obvious in verse number 11.

131
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:34,479
It says, and our adversary said, they shall not know, neither see, till we come in the

132
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:43,679
midst among them and slay them, and notice what it says, and cause the work to cease.

133
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,200
It's interesting to me as I know in verse number 11, really the approach of the enemy.

134
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,440
You notice that they say, they shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among

135
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
them.

136
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,039
We find that we would speak in the New Testament.

137
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,759
we understand some truth with regard to

138
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,959
Jude makes this statement

139
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,439
only one chapter in the book of Jude,

140
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,639
but we find that he says this

141
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,959
in v. 3,

142
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
that it was needful for me to write unto you

143
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,879
and exhort you that you should earnestly contend

144
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,019
for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

145
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,839
Why?

146
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
For there are certain men crept in unawares.

147
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,439
We're familiar with the terminology

148
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:26,039
that it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

149
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,559
We're understanding the way

150
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,599
in which the enemy is deceitful

151
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,559
and the enemy tries to come in

152
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,239
and seeks to identify themselves

153
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,679
as being maybe one of us,

154
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,959
of seeking to deceive us through their approach.

155
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,999
Remember, the apostle Paul said

156
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,439
to the believers in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 11,

157
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,879
in v. 13,

158
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,439
he says, for such are false apostles,

159
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:53,919
deceitful workers,

160
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,439
notice what he says that they do,

161
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,879
transforming themselves

162
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,879
into the apostles of Christ.

163
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,559
And no marvel.

164
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,919
And no marvel.

165
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,479
For Satan himself is transformed

166
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,079
into an angel of light.

167
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,879
Therefore, it is no great thing

168
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,639
if his ministers also be transformed

169
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,879
as the ministers of righteousness

170
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,119
whose end shall be according to their works.

171
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,199
John says that we're to try the spirits.

172
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,799
We find here that the enemy,

173
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,479
the adversaries as they're noted

174
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,679
in v. 11,

175
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,799
that they say,

176
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,319
here's what we're going to do.

177
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,719
They're not even going to know what happened.

178
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,879
They shall not know, neither see,

179
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,559
till we come in the midst among them

180
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:45,159
and slay them and cause the work to cease.

181
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,559
You see the progression in this plan

182
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,919
as it's really revealed to us.

183
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,079
And I know we've skipped around

184
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,359
because we're going to go back

185
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,159
and catch those verses that we skipped,

186
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,959
but you notice the plan of the enemy

187
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,439
that it begins with some mockery.

188
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,599
It begins with seeking to just simply

189
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,559
discourage you from ever getting off

190
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,199
the starting block, so to speak.

191
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,519
And then we find that they say

192
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,679
we're going to go and fight against them.

193
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,439
And we find that they want to hinder the work.

194
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,039
And then we find that really ultimately

195
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,759
their goal is to cause the work to cease.

196
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,559
The enemy's not satisfied with simply hindering the work.

197
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,159
They want it to cease.

198
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,839
I'm thankful for the promises of God.

199
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,199
I'm thankful for Matthew 16 when Jesus said,

200
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,559
I will build my church and the gates of hell

201
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,639
shall not prevail against it.

202
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,119
I'm thankful for biblical promises that we have

203
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,879
with regard to the work of God,

204
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,359
the work of Christ and how we can prevail.

205
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,359
But we must be mindful that the enemy,

206
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,039
that there are many adversaries

207
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,959
and the enemy has a plan in his plan.

208
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,359
Remember what Peter said.

209
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,039
I mentioned the very beginning of the message

210
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,479
that it's easy for most of us

211
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,479
to acknowledge that we have an enemy.

212
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,399
And we find that Peter says this

213
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,599
and understand that Peter understood.

214
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,439
Remember in Luke, it was Jesus when He said to Peter,

215
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,839
He said, Peter, Satan hath desired to have you

216
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,799
that he may sift you as wheat.

217
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,159
But then He gives them some encouragement.

218
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,519
He says, but I have prayed for thee.

219
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,319
I've prayed for thee.

220
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,199
And He says, when thou art converted,

221
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,799
strengthen thy brethren.

222
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,679
And God would use Peter to write first and second Peter.

223
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,799
And we find there in 1 Peter 5

224
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,559
that Peter begins to encourage

225
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,999
and strengthen the brethren

226
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,959
by reminding them that we have an enemy

227
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,439
and that He walketh about seeking whom He may devour.

228
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,799
We note, first of all, the plan of the enemy.

229
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,399
We note, number two, the prayer of God's people.

230
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,439
What a great response to the enemy.

231
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,639
To go to God in prayer.

232
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,559
Sometimes I feel as if in many of our lives,

233
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,039
throughout the history, I guess maybe, of our churches,

234
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,479
sometimes we have not fully acknowledged

235
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,679
the true power of prayer.

236
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,359
And we find here that the Bible says in verse number four,

237
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,319
after the mockery that we read of

238
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,519
in the first three verses of Nehemiah 4,

239
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,639
the Bible says,

240
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,639
Hear, O our God, for we are despised.

241
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,119
And turn their reproach upon their own head

242
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:28,919
and give them for a prey in the land of captivity.

243
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,079
I like how they prayed.

244
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,439
I like how they responded to that which the enemy was saying

245
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,279
and how the enemy was angry, of course, and mocking.

246
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
We find that they pray to God

247
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:45,999
and they say turn their reproach upon their own heads.

248
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,519
Give them for a prey in the land of captivity.

249
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,999
Notice in verse number nine,

250
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,799
after the enemy conspired all of them together,

251
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,479
according to what we read in verse number eight,

252
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,119
we find that in verse number nine,

253
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,959
the Bible says,

254
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,799
Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God

255
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,159
and set a watch against them day and night because of them.

256
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,359
We find that they were steadfast in prayer.

257
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,119
They understood the importance of seeking the face of God

258
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:17,759
and understanding what God is capable of doing.

259
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,519
We understand the many prayer promises

260
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,879
that God has given us in His Word.

261
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,039
We often quote those prayer promises.

262
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,959
We find that James would put it this way,

263
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,279
that the effectual fervent prayer

264
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,599
of a righteous man availeth much.

265
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,519
Prayer changes things.

266
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,759
Our God delights in answering prayer.

267
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,359
By the way, He delights in answering specific prayer.

268
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,639
We find they prayed specifically.

269
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
They not only prayed,

270
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,879
we find that they set a watch against them day and night

271
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,159
because of them according to verse number nine.

272
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,079
And we notice that as we look at the plan of the enemy,

273
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,599
we look at the prayer of God's people,

274
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,359
I want you to notice as we move through the text,

275
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,559
the power of God.

276
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,319
In verse number 12, it says,

277
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,679
It came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,

278
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,639
they sent unto us ten times.

279
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,679
Now, think about that.

280
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,519
Ten times.

281
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,399
I mean, the persistence of the enemy is noted.

282
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,119
From all places, whence ye shall return unto us,

283
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,119
they will be upon you.

284
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:21,159
Therefore said I in the lower places behind the wall

285
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,279
and on the higher places,

286
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,279
I even set the people after their families

287
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,519
with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

288
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,359
And I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles,

289
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,679
unto the rulers, unto the rest of the people.

290
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,439
So Nehemiah stands up, he's looking, he rises.

291
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,159
He says to the nobles, the rulers,

292
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:36,999
and the rest of the people,

293
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,559
notice what he says.

294
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,239
Be not ye afraid of them.

295
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,319
Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible,

296
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,599
and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters,

297
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,799
your wives and your houses.

298
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,079
And it came to pass when our enemies heard

299
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,439
that it was known unto us,

300
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,079
and notice what the verse says,

301
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,079
and God had brought their counsel to naught.

302
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,759
That we returned all of us to the wall,

303
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,759
every one unto his work.

304
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,159
At the end of verse number 20,

305
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,319
well, let's read the entirety.

306
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,679
It says in what place, therefore,

307
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,159
ye hear the sound of the trumpet,

308
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,639
resort ye thither unto us.

309
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,519
Our God shall fight for us.

310
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,439
Remember what Nehemiah said

311
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,999
as we made note of it at the end of chapter number two,

312
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,839
once those enemies were first revealed to us.

313
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,319
It's interesting, as Nehemiah gets into the city,

314
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,279
it says in verse number 11 of chapter two,

315
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,879
so I came to Jerusalem, I was there three days,

316
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,959
and we find that he begins to examine and go through

317
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,719
and begin to, I guess, get a report, if you will,

318
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,959
of what was going on,

319
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,119
and we find that he then reveals

320
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,719
what it is that God has put in his heart.

321
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,319
It's recorded for us in verses 17 and 18.

322
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,119
The enemy is made known,

323
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,559
and remember, Nehemiah answered them and said,

324
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,759
the God of heaven, He will prosper us.

325
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,799
So we've got to remember the power of God.

326
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,119
See, where we focus in the time of our adversity,

327
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,319
that we understand that our God is the Lord God Omnipotent

328
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,439
and that He reigns and He rules,

329
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,799
and we find that Nehemiah says,

330
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,399
be not ye afraid of them.

331
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,799
Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible.

332
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,359
We find that he's reminding them,

333
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,159
yes, we understand there's an enemy,

334
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,639
we understand they have a plan,

335
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,599
we understand what's going on,

336
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,839
but no, God brought their counsel to naught.

337
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,719
Why? Because we prayed.

338
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,759
We saw what God is able to do.

339
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,320
And he reminded them,

340
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,519
at the end of verse number 20,

341
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,039
our God shall fight for us.

342
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,599
We find many times, especially in the Old Testament,

343
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,719
it's noted the battle is the Lord's.

344
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,239
The battle is the Lord's.

345
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:59,799
And yes, we are to go in the power of God,

346
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,479
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might,

347
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,119
put on the whole armor of God,

348
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,239
and we understand that we are soldiers

349
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:09,239
and we are called to be engaged in the battle,

350
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,919
the spiritual battle that's taking place.

351
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,399
We acknowledge our enemy and what he seeks to do,

352
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:16,039
but we must understand that we go not in our own power,

353
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,759
but we go in the power of God.

354
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,119
The songwriter said the armor of flesh will fail you.

355
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,079
The songwriter was accurate in understanding that truth.

356
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,279
Remember, it was the Apostle Paul,

357
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,279
he said, I know that in me that is in my flesh

358
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,679
dwelleth no good thing.

359
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,039
He said this, he said, the things that I would, I do not.

360
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,919
The things I would not, that I do.

361
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,519
I mean, he understood the struggle

362
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,679
and all that goes with it,

363
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,679
but he said that the Lord would give victory,

364
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,159
that we are conquerors,

365
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,279
more than conquerors through Christ.

366
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,320
We see their enemy.

367
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,559
They have a plan.

368
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,000
The people of God pray.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,679
The power of God is noted.

370
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:56,359
And I want you to notice as we conclude the chapter,

371
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,959
note the persistence of God's people.

372
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:02,379
The Bible says at the end of v. 15,

373
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,499
notice what it says after it tells us

374
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,859
how God brought their counsel to naught,

375
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:10,359
that we returned all of us to the wall,

376
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,219
every one unto his work.

377
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,979
See, God had a plan and a purpose

378
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,979
for this work that is recorded for us,

379
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,599
this historical account that is given to us

380
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,759
in the book of Nehemiah,

381
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,059
the rebuilding of the walls.

382
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,479
Remember, we revealed to you there

383
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,779
in the beginning of the book of Nehemiah

384
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:31,439
how that he inquired and he received word

385
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,399
that the people, yes, they were in great affliction

386
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,539
and reproach, but the wall of Jerusalem

387
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,739
was broken down.

388
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,739
The gates were burned with fire.

389
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,679
And as we begin to look at the work

390
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,979
that God had given Nehemiah to be engaged in,

391
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,619
it was to do this work.

392
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,639
He tells us there in chapter 2

393
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,559
that the people, they had a mind to work.

394
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,239
And what a blessing to understand

395
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,559
how they got back to the work.

396
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,199
It came to pass in v. 16,

397
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,019
from that time forth,

398
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,319
that the half of My servants wrought in the work

399
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,919
and the other half of them held

400
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,599
both the spears, the shields, the bows,

401
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,519
the habergens, and the rulers

402
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,699
were behind all the house of Judah.

403
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:14,199
They which builded on the wall

404
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,599
and they that bear burdens

405
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,999
with those that laid it.

406
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,699
Everyone with one of his hands

407
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:19,799
wrought in the work

408
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,999
and with the other hand held a weapon.

409
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,899
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

410
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:26,939
There was an enemy.

411
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,299
An enemy was seeking to cause the work to cease.

412
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,999
That was their goal.

413
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,959
And so they prayed and they were persistent.

414
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,159
They got back. They persevered.

415
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,559
They got back into the work.

416
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,079
They were going to move forward.

417
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,759
They understand there was an enemy.

418
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,839
And so, Nehemiah devises this plan

419
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,439
and they're working and they have

420
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,919
everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work

421
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,839
and with the other hand held a weapon.

422
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,519
The Bible says that the builders,

423
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,739
everyone in v. 18,

424
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,279
had a sword girded by his side

425
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,459
and so builded.

426
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,319
And he that sounded the trumpet was by me

427
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,099
and I said unto the nobles and to the rulers

428
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,459
and to the rest of the people,

429
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,799
the work is great and large

430
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,259
and we are separated upon the wall

431
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,659
one far from another.

432
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,399
In what place, therefore, you hear the sound of the trumpet?

433
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,419
Resort ye thither unto us.

434
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:12,899
Our God shall fight for us.

435
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,379
Notice v. 21,

436
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:17,699
so we labored in the work.

437
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,379
And half of them held the spears

438
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,599
from the rising of the morning

439
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,739
till the stars appeared.

440
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,899
Likewise, at the same time, said I unto the people,

441
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:25,179
and everyone with his servant

442
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,459
lodged within Jerusalem,

443
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,699
that in the night they may be a guard to us

444
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:29,739
and labor on the day.

445
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,179
So neither I nor my brethren

446
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,619
nor my servants nor the men of the guard

447
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,659
which followed me,

448
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,199
none of us put off our clothes,

449
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:39,959
saving that everyone put them off for washing.

450
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,919
I want to note something that's interesting

451
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,239
as to the work that they're engaged in.

452
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,879
Now, we're engaged in a work

453
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,379
that's a different work than the work

454
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,379
that they're engaged in.

455
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,179
We're not building a wall.

456
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,579
And that's not the work that we're doing.

457
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,819
We have a work to do.

458
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,059
Amen?

459
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,099
And remember, Paul said that we are

460
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,159
laborers together with God.

461
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,739
We're to put our hand to the plow.

462
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:04,059
We're to be engaged in the work of the Lord

463
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,019
and the service of the King.

464
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,819
And what a blessing it is to be able

465
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,259
to be engaged in the work that God is doing

466
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,659
and to be a co-laborer,

467
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,859
to labor together with God.

468
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,339
And we understand that as we're engaged

469
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,859
in this work that God has given us,

470
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,379
that we have a task to do

471
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,459
and that we have an enemy.

472
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,499
Many adversaries, Paul said,

473
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,979
we have an enemy that would like to hinder us,

474
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,739
that would like to cause the work to cease,

475
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,419
but we prevail, we persist,

476
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,339
we continue to move forward.

477
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,339
And we note that the Bible tells us

478
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,539
something interesting in verse number 18.

479
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,739
And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

480
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,859
And then it tells us in verse number 20,

481
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,899
in what place therefore ye hear

482
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:52,539
the sound of the trumpet,

483
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,619
resort ye thither unto us,

484
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,219
our God shall fight for us.

485
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,819
And it reminds me as I would make

486
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,499
spiritual application this evening

487
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:00,899
and begin to think about our own lives

488
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,299
and the ministry that we're engaged in

489
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,699
and the work that we're doing,

490
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:06,379
I'm thankful that even as we look here

491
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,859
and he says that there were all of these people

492
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,139
that we're building,

493
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:13,379
and he says that the work is great and large,

494
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,099
and we are separated upon the wall

495
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,579
one from another in verse number 19.

496
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,499
The work that we're engaged in is a great work.

497
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,859
It's the Lord's work.

498
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,699
We're not building a wall,

499
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:26,539
but if we could make the application this evening,

500
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,739
I am thankful that there are local churches

501
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,179
all around the globe

502
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,699
that are seeking to do the work of the Lord,

503
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:35,579
that understand that our responsibility

504
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,979
is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

505
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:41,339
It's the only hope for mankind.

506
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,939
The only hope.

507
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,979
And we preach the gospel

508
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:47,739
in every place that we can go.

509
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,419
It works on every continent of the world.

510
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,139
It works for any people group around the globe,

511
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:56,139
and we preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,

512
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,579
and we are engaged in that work.

513
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,859
Now, I'm thankful.

514
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,019
Listen, the reality,

515
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,739
yes, there are churches that are closing.

516
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,899
There are churches that are faltering

517
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:05,739
and so on and so forth,

518
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,299
but there are good churches around the globe.

519
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,059
There are good churches here in our county.

520
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:12,659
There are good churches in Virginia.

521
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,219
There are good churches in the United States of America.

522
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,059
There are good churches all around the globe.

523
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:20,139
We're all engaged in the same great work.

524
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:22,379
We're not all together in the same place,

525
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:24,339
but we're all engaged in the great work.

526
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,019
And here's the reality

527
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:29,299
that we're engaged in the work until when?

528
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,619
Until the trumpet of the Lord shall sound.

529
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,579
Amen?

530
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,179
Remember, at the end of the church age,

531
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,379
there's this wonderful thing that we call the rapture.

532
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:42,019
Some people criticize the rapture

533
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,979
because they say the word's not in the Bible.

534
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:46,419
Well, the word means caught up.

535
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,019
And the Bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 4,

536
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,259
for this we say unto you,

537
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,579
by the word of the Lord,

538
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,099
that we which are alive and remain

539
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,579
unto the coming of the Lord

540
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,459
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

541
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,939
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

542
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:02,619
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

543
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:03,579
with what?

544
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,939
With the trump of God.

545
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,219
And the dead in Christ shall rise first.

546
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,619
You know what Nehemiah said?

547
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,819
There's one that's near me with a trumpet.

548
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,419
And when the trumpet sounds,

549
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,739
everyone retreats together to this place

550
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,699
and the Lord's gonna fight for us.

551
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:25,459
And we find here that they were to be engaged in the work

552
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,139
until they heard the sound of the trumpet.

553
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,619
And I tell you, we're to be engaged in the work

554
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:33,979
until we hear the sound of the trumpet.

555
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:34,819
The songwriter said,

556
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:35,899
I don't know who wrote the song.

557
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,139
We've sung it many times.

558
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,779
Listen for the trumpet.

559
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,339
Jesus is coming.

560
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,339
And He is.

561
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,139
But we're not just sitting around

562
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:46,859
doing nothing waiting to hear the trumpet.

563
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,619
We're to be engaged in the work of the Lord,

564
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,819
redeeming the time.

565
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:51,659
Why?

566
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,499
For the days are evil.

567
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:55,019
Can we not see that the days are evil?

568
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:58,139
Oh, that we'd put our hand to the plow

569
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:00,179
and get engaged in the work,

570
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,099
understanding what God has for us.

571
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,019
And we're just working until we hear the trumpet.

572
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:07,259
And when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,

573
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,099
man, we're going to heaven, amen.

574
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,379
The rapture of the church.

575
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,139
We're out of here.

576
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,419
Starts the seven year tribulation.

577
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:20,059
By the way, when you think about that understanding

578
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,979
prophetically of the book of Revelation,

579
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:23,579
you see all that takes place.

580
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,419
It's there in Revelation chapter number four,

581
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:28,219
chapters two and three deal with the seven churches in Asia.

582
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:29,219
The letters are written.

583
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:31,779
All of the information is given to those churches.

584
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,019
Yes, they were historical, literal churches

585
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,579
that were in those locales.

586
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,539
The message that is given to those churches

587
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,299
is applicable for churches even still today.

588
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,499
And it's important that we're mindful of the message.

589
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,579
But in chapter number four of the book of Revelation,

590
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,619
we find the Bible tells us that John, he heard a voice.

591
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:52,019
And the Bible tells us that the voice that he heard

592
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,659
said this, come up hither.

593
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,939
Begin to look at the passages in Revelation

594
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:04,419
that are recorded after this event.

595
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:07,419
Begin to speak about the tribulation period.

596
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,619
How God is working.

597
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,819
And how God is bringing His people Israel

598
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,339
to a place of acknowledging who He is as the Messiah.

599
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:19,779
We don't have time this evening to get into

600
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,939
all the eschatology.

601
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,059
But I want you to understand from the book of Nehemiah

602
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:24,899
in the fourth chapter,

603
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:26,859
I want you to be encouraged this evening.

604
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:28,619
You say, how can we be encouraged with a title

605
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,579
like there are many adversaries?

606
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:33,379
I thought the same thing as I was preparing, amen?

607
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,859
But the reality is that we can be encouraged

608
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,979
because we're more than conquerors in Christ

609
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,179
or through Christ.

610
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,099
We can be encouraged because we have a work

611
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,499
to be engaged in.

612
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:47,139
And the work that we're engaged in is a great work.

613
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,739
And when the work that we're engaged in,

614
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,539
when Jesus is gonna come,

615
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,659
He's gonna come with the trumpet is going to sound.

616
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:59,179
We read there in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

617
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:03,019
but we find also there in 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

618
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:05,139
behold, verse 51, I show you a mystery.

619
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:09,379
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

620
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,939
In a moment, the twinkling of an eye,

621
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:14,859
at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound.

622
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,579
The dead shall be raised incorruptible

623
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:19,659
and we shall be changed.

624
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:23,899
For this corruptible must put on incorruption

625
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,739
and this mortal must put on immortality.

626
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:32,499
Can I tell you, if I can put myself in the place of Nehemiah,

627
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,619
if I can put myself into the dialogue

628
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:38,659
of chapter number four of the book of Nehemiah,

629
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,539
they're working and they're working.

630
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,979
And if there's a group of people that come over

631
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:45,379
and come to where Nehemiah is,

632
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:46,899
Nehemiah says, what are you doing?

633
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:49,859
You didn't hear the trumpet sound, did you?

634
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,459
You stay engaged in the work.

635
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,899
The trumpet didn't sound.

636
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,379
But when he said that the one that sounded the trumpet

637
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,219
was Biden.

638
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:03,659
me. And so if there was a need for them because of the fact that there was a

639
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,659
level of vulnerability from a physical perspective because the work was great

640
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:12,059
and large they were separated upon the wall far from one another that if they

641
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,579
needed to all retreat and come to one place that Nehemiah would give the

642
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:21,019
signal and the trumpet would sound. And that's when they're all supposed to come

643
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,499
back to that place. And so if they start trying to retreat and get out of the

644
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:30,939
work and just want to be near Nehemiah and he says no no no go work. The trumpet

645
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:36,939
hasn't sounded. And for us New Testament believers as we understand if we could

646
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:42,099
make an application this evening listen the trumpet hasn't sounded. There's some

647
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,379
people out there trying to tell you that the return of Christ already took place

648
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:50,699
they needed to read their Bibles again. Amen.

649
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:55,979
Jesus listen the rapture hasn't taken place he hasn't returned yet. He's coming.

650
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:05,459
The return of the Lord draweth nigh. He's coming. We'll hear the trumpet. The

651
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:10,219
Bible tells us that we'll ever be with him. What a blessing. But until the

652
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:17,299
trumpet sounds we got to work. We got to work. The work that God's given us is a

653
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:23,459
great work. It's the work of preaching the gospel to every creature. Think about

654
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:30,979
that. 7 billion almost 8 billion people on our earth. A lot of people. It's a

655
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:36,259
great work. We continue to send people out. We continue to go out into our

656
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:44,139
community and around the world to do the work of God. When the work or excuse me

657
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:49,619
when the trumpet sounds we're gone in a moment twinkling of an eye. The work is

658
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:56,619
finished. Until then redeem the time. Get engaged in the work of the Lord. There

659
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:00,699
are many adversaries. He wants you to quit. He really likes you to just not

660
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:05,459
even get engaged in the work. Just be on the sidelines. Say yeah I don't know if I

661
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:11,779
want to get engaged in that. It's too too difficult, too hard, too whatever. No no.

662
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:18,139
We say we we've been enlisted in the army. Last week we looked at Archippus

663
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:23,899
right. He is a good soldier. A fellow soldier. What a blessing. Oh that God

664
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:29,499
would help us to be engaged in the work of the Lord. Father we love you. We thank

665
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:32,619
you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. The truth contained therein.

666
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:37,819
I pray God that you would help us to understand the historical account that

667
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:42,219
is given to us. I'm thankful to report that in chapter number six the book of

668
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:47,019
Nehemiah that it records for us that the walls were finished. What a blessing. Oh

669
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:59,459
the enemy continued to fight and to oppose and used different tactics. People

670
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:04,099
were persistent under the leadership of Nehemiah as he followed you as they

671
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:09,939
prayed. God we thank you for your power. We thank you for bringing it to pass.

672
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:14,779
Lord I pray as we consider an application for us this evening that

673
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:20,779
we'd understand that we're engaged in a work and it's a great work. It's an

674
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:25,659
honorable work. It's the greatest work to be able to give the gospel of Jesus

675
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:30,899
Christ which is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.

676
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:37,779
Lord I pray you'd help us to be faithful until the trumpet of the Lord shall

677
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:44,619
sound. We thank you for the truth that Jesus is coming and indeed we are

678
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:53,499
listening for the trumpet but I pray that you'd help us to be faithfully involved

679
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,979
in the work you've given us to do that we'd redeem the time. Understand that the

680
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:05,499
days are evil. Use us God in such a way that eternity would be impacted and you

681
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:11,939
would be glorified. Well thank you for it in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
