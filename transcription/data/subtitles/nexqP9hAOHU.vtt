WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
you will, and in the book of Nehemiah, and looking at this portion of Scripture, Nehemiah

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.560
chapter number 4, and as we get to that passage of Scripture, I want to remind you of something

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.559
that the Apostle Paul said as he was ministering there to the believers in Corinth.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.280
Of course, we understand that God allowed the Apostle Paul to minister in Corinth for

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.840
an extended period of time, and during that time of ministry, a church was established,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.680
and then God would use Paul to write two letters back to this church, instructing

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.919
them with regard to their walk with the Lord, and of course, with various things within

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:42.919
the church, but Paul mentioned this in 1 Corinthians 16, in verse number 9, he said,

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.200
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and then he ends the verse by saying this,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.000
And there are many adversaries.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.400
There are many adversaries, and this evening, I want to preach a message that I've entitled

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.119
There Are Many Adversaries, but we're going to look at Nehemiah chapter 4 with that thought

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.480
of what Paul said in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.160
The reality is that for most of us, it is easy to acknowledge that we have an enemy.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.080
The Bible declares that we have an enemy, and we understand that the enemy, that we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.519
are engaged in spiritual battle, it's not flesh and blood that we wrestle against, but

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.239
spiritual wickedness in high places, and we understand that truth, and we understand that

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:30.319
throughout the scriptures, that the Lord has given us a number of accounts to help

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.279
us understand how the enemy operates.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.360
As we have the opportunity to read much of the accounts, or many of the accounts, I should

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.639
say, in the Old Testament, that as we read those accounts, we have the opportunity to

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.699
get insight as to how the enemy is working.

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:56.019
It's not simply a lesson in history, though it contains an accurate historical record,

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:02.180
and as we look at the accuracy of the historical record, if we end there, we miss the spiritual

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.580
application, and so it's imperative for us to understand that God's not simply giving

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.020
us the history, though he is.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.539
He's giving us truth to help us understand the way that the enemy operates, and really,

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.059
it enables us to be better equipped for the battle.

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.059
As we look at Nehemiah, we're going to be in chapter number four, and I want you to

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:30.380
understand some things that are taking place as we get into chapter number four this evening.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.020
Obviously, we've not been studying through the book of Nehemiah, and we're jumping in

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.419
chapter number four, and so just briefly, I want to give you some information.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.580
Nehemiah, of course, was not in Jerusalem at the beginning of the book.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.160
As it's being written, the people of God had been carried captive already at this particular

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.740
time in their history.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.539
Of course, a remnant was returning under the decree of Cyrus, and we understand that as

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:02.259
we look at the passage of Scripture, that in the very first chapter, that God gives

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:08.779
us some insight as to the concern that Nehemiah has for his home country.

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.660
The reason we know that he's concerned is because he inquired, and he made inquiry as

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.300
to what was going on, and he received a report, and part of the report that he received, according

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.940
to Nehemiah 1 and verse number three, is that the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.020
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.220
As we go through the book of Nehemiah, we begin to see the work that is taking place

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.419
on rebuilding the walls.

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.860
We understand that it's in the second chapter that Nehemiah makes his petition, if you will,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.059
to King Artaxerxes with regard to going and fulfilling the work that God had called him to.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:51.539
We read in chapter number three, if you were to read the entirety of the chapter, you begin

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:56.660
to see how the rebuilding of the walls and the workers are assigned, and as you go through

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.339
the passage, you'll find at the beginning of verse number two, and many of the verses

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:07.460
thereafter will say, and next unto him, and then it will name some people, and they were

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.139
working on this part of the wall, on this particular gate, and then next unto him there

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.459
was this group of people, and so on and so forth, and so we kind of see what's happening.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.140
Even before we get to the fourth chapter, at the end of chapter number two, we're made

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.420
aware of some of the opposition.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.260
They're named by name at the end of chapter number two.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.100
The Bible tells us in verse number 19, but when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.660
servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.260
us and said, what is this thing that ye do?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.100
Will ye rebel against the king?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.980
I love the response that is recorded for us in verse number 20.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:57.220
It says, then answered I them and said unto them, the God of heaven, he will prosper us.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.420
Don't you like the faith of Nehemiah?

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:08.820
He said, therefore, we his servants will arise and build, but ye have no portion, nor rite,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.100
nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.820
The workers are assigned, and we come to chapter number four, and the Bible begins in verse

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.040
number one, and it says this, it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that he builded

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:30.679
the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews.

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.720
As we enter into the fourth chapter, we find that the Bible would give us the record that

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.239
he, Nehemiah, is saying that the enemy, Sanballat in particular, that he heard that we builded

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:44.600
the wall.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.640
Can I tell you that the enemy is content if we're not making progress?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.320
You're not going to mess with us if we're not doing anything.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.000
But when you try to do something for God, you begin to have some opposition.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
You begin to deal with the enemy opposing the work of God.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.959
As you take notes this evening, I want you to consider first of all with me the plan

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.040
of the enemy.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.839
We find that the enemy, the plan is revealed throughout the passage.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.880
We'll go through a number of verses here.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.320
You find that in verse number one, the Bible says that they mock the Jews.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.119
There are times in which the enemy will mock the people of God, will mock that which we're

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.200
seeking to do.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.720
And we find that it says in verse number two, and he spake before his brethren in the army

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.399
of Samaria and said, what do these feeble Jews?

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.140
Will they fortify themselves?

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.320
Will they sacrifice?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.079
Will they make an end in a day?

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:43.399
Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:48.880
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him and he said, even that which they build, if a fox

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:54.640
go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.640
Mocking them.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.880
They're going to build a wall, but if a little fox were to climb upon it, it's going to fall.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.000
We see the enemy, they have a plan.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.880
Notice in verse number seven, as we continue to kind of dissect what's going on here, it

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.480
says it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.279
and the Astrodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:23.480
began to be stopped, notice, then they were very wroth.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480
So what do they do?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.480
They conspired, all of them together, to come and to fight against Jerusalem.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.200
Notice where it says, and to hinder it.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.040
Now it's interesting, as we note the progression that is made here, you find that the enemy

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.079
seeks to really discourage the work from even going forward.

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:49.119
The enemy seeks to come and mock and use the verbiage that is used here, these feeble Jews,

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:53.040
and talking about that even if they build it, if a fox were to go up on it, it's going

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.399
to break down their stone wall, and the enemy seeks to discourage us right on the onset

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:02.600
of even trying to do anything for God.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.600
And when that discouragement doesn't cause the people of God to stop, we find that we

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.799
come to verse number seven and we see the plan further develop, because here's what

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:13.799
they heard.

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:18.799
They heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches, notice, began

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.059
to be stopped.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:21.359
How did they respond?

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:23.200
Then they were very wroth.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.440
So now they have to increase their attack.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.320
They need to do something else.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.679
They need to go to level two, if you will.

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:37.119
I mean, if the mocking and that verbal opposition that is recorded for us in the first three

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:42.559
verses, if that works, then the enemy doesn't even have to expound any energy, effort, they

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.679
don't need to come and fight, they don't need to do anything.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:49.599
But we find that they heard that the work was going forward.

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.400
It wasn't complete, but it was going forward.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
So guess what the enemy does?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.700
We need to go to the next step.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.599
We need to increase our attack.

00:08:56.599 --> 00:09:01.400
And we find that they are conspiring, notice in verse number eight, all of them together

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.760
to come up and to fight against Jerusalem.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.119
It says, and to hinder it.

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:12.960
It's interesting as we move forward through the plan as it's revealed to us that yes,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.919
the enemy wants to hinder the work, but their ultimate goal is not to simply hinder it.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:22.099
They want the work to cease.

00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:25.880
And we see that very obvious in verse number 11.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:34.479
It says, and our adversary said, they shall not know, neither see, till we come in the

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:43.679
midst among them and slay them, and notice what it says, and cause the work to cease.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:50.200
It's interesting to me as I know in verse number 11, really the approach of the enemy.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.440
You notice that they say, they shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.840
them.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.039
We find that we would speak in the New Testament.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.759
we understand some truth with regard to

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.959
Jude makes this statement

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.439
only one chapter in the book of Jude,

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:09.639
but we find that he says this

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.959
in v. 3,

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.959
that it was needful for me to write unto you

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.879
and exhort you that you should earnestly contend

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:17.019
for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:17.839
Why?

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:21.519
For there are certain men crept in unawares.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.439
We're familiar with the terminology

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:26.039
that it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.559
We're understanding the way

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.599
in which the enemy is deceitful

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.559
and the enemy tries to come in

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:35.239
and seeks to identify themselves

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:37.679
as being maybe one of us,

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.959
of seeking to deceive us through their approach.

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:43.999
Remember, the apostle Paul said

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:48.439
to the believers in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 11,

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.879
in v. 13,

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:52.439
he says, for such are false apostles,

00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:53.919
deceitful workers,

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.439
notice what he says that they do,

00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:57.879
transforming themselves

00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:00.879
into the apostles of Christ.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.559
And no marvel.

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.919
And no marvel.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:07.479
For Satan himself is transformed

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:09.079
into an angel of light.

00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:10.879
Therefore, it is no great thing

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.639
if his ministers also be transformed

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.879
as the ministers of righteousness

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:21.119
whose end shall be according to their works.

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:24.199
John says that we're to try the spirits.

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:25.799
We find here that the enemy,

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.479
the adversaries as they're noted

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.679
in v. 11,

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:29.799
that they say,

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:31.319
here's what we're going to do.

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:34.719
They're not even going to know what happened.

00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:36.879
They shall not know, neither see,

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:39.559
till we come in the midst among them

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:45.159
and slay them and cause the work to cease.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.559
You see the progression in this plan

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:48.919
as it's really revealed to us.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:50.079
And I know we've skipped around

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.359
because we're going to go back

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:53.159
and catch those verses that we skipped,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:54.959
but you notice the plan of the enemy

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:57.439
that it begins with some mockery.

00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:59.599
It begins with seeking to just simply

00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:01.559
discourage you from ever getting off

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:04.199
the starting block, so to speak.

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:05.519
And then we find that they say

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.679
we're going to go and fight against them.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:10.439
And we find that they want to hinder the work.

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:13.039
And then we find that really ultimately

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:17.759
their goal is to cause the work to cease.

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:20.559
The enemy's not satisfied with simply hindering the work.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.159
They want it to cease.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.839
I'm thankful for the promises of God.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:27.199
I'm thankful for Matthew 16 when Jesus said,

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.559
I will build my church and the gates of hell

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:31.639
shall not prevail against it.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:35.119
I'm thankful for biblical promises that we have

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:37.879
with regard to the work of God,

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:40.359
the work of Christ and how we can prevail.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.359
But we must be mindful that the enemy,

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:44.039
that there are many adversaries

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:45.959
and the enemy has a plan in his plan.

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:47.359
Remember what Peter said.

00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:49.039
I mentioned the very beginning of the message

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.479
that it's easy for most of us

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.479
to acknowledge that we have an enemy.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.399
And we find that Peter says this

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.599
and understand that Peter understood.

00:12:56.599 --> 00:13:00.439
Remember in Luke, it was Jesus when He said to Peter,

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:04.839
He said, Peter, Satan hath desired to have you

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:07.799
that he may sift you as wheat.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.159
But then He gives them some encouragement.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:11.519
He says, but I have prayed for thee.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.319
I've prayed for thee.

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.199
And He says, when thou art converted,

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:17.799
strengthen thy brethren.

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:20.679
And God would use Peter to write first and second Peter.

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:23.799
And we find there in 1 Peter 5

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:25.559
that Peter begins to encourage

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:26.999
and strengthen the brethren

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:29.959
by reminding them that we have an enemy

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:34.439
and that He walketh about seeking whom He may devour.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.799
We note, first of all, the plan of the enemy.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:41.399
We note, number two, the prayer of God's people.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.439
What a great response to the enemy.

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.639
To go to God in prayer.

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:52.559
Sometimes I feel as if in many of our lives,

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:57.039
throughout the history, I guess maybe, of our churches,

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:01.479
sometimes we have not fully acknowledged

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.679
the true power of prayer.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:08.359
And we find here that the Bible says in verse number four,

00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:11.319
after the mockery that we read of

00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:13.519
in the first three verses of Nehemiah 4,

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:14.639
the Bible says,

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:19.639
Hear, O our God, for we are despised.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:24.119
And turn their reproach upon their own head

00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:28.919
and give them for a prey in the land of captivity.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.079
I like how they prayed.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.439
I like how they responded to that which the enemy was saying

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:39.279
and how the enemy was angry, of course, and mocking.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.279
We find that they pray to God

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:45.999
and they say turn their reproach upon their own heads.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.519
Give them for a prey in the land of captivity.

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:49.999
Notice in verse number nine,

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:52.799
after the enemy conspired all of them together,

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:54.479
according to what we read in verse number eight,

00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:56.119
we find that in verse number nine,

00:14:56.119 --> 00:14:56.959
the Bible says,

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:01.799
Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God

00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:06.159
and set a watch against them day and night because of them.

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:10.359
We find that they were steadfast in prayer.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:14.119
They understood the importance of seeking the face of God

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:17.759
and understanding what God is capable of doing.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:20.519
We understand the many prayer promises

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.879
that God has given us in His Word.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:25.039
We often quote those prayer promises.

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:27.959
We find that James would put it this way,

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:29.279
that the effectual fervent prayer

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.599
of a righteous man availeth much.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.519
Prayer changes things.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:36.759
Our God delights in answering prayer.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:42.359
By the way, He delights in answering specific prayer.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.639
We find they prayed specifically.

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.399
They not only prayed,

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.879
we find that they set a watch against them day and night

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.159
because of them according to verse number nine.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.079
And we notice that as we look at the plan of the enemy,

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.599
we look at the prayer of God's people,

00:15:56.599 --> 00:15:59.359
I want you to notice as we move through the text,

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:01.559
the power of God.

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:03.319
In verse number 12, it says,

00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:06.679
It came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:08.639
they sent unto us ten times.

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:09.679
Now, think about that.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:10.519
Ten times.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:14.399
I mean, the persistence of the enemy is noted.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:17.119
From all places, whence ye shall return unto us,

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:18.119
they will be upon you.

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:21.159
Therefore said I in the lower places behind the wall

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.279
and on the higher places,

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:24.279
I even set the people after their families

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:26.519
with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.359
And I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles,

00:16:29.359 --> 00:16:31.679
unto the rulers, unto the rest of the people.

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:34.439
So Nehemiah stands up, he's looking, he rises.

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:36.159
He says to the nobles, the rulers,

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:36.999
and the rest of the people,

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:38.559
notice what he says.

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:41.239
Be not ye afraid of them.

00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:45.319
Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible,

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:48.599
and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters,

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:50.799
your wives and your houses.

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:53.079
And it came to pass when our enemies heard

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:55.439
that it was known unto us,

00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:57.079
and notice what the verse says,

00:16:57.079 --> 00:17:02.079
and God had brought their counsel to naught.

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:06.759
That we returned all of us to the wall,

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.759
every one unto his work.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:11.159
At the end of verse number 20,

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:12.319
well, let's read the entirety.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.679
It says in what place, therefore,

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:16.159
ye hear the sound of the trumpet,

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:18.639
resort ye thither unto us.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:22.519
Our God shall fight for us.

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:24.439
Remember what Nehemiah said

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:26.999
as we made note of it at the end of chapter number two,

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:29.839
once those enemies were first revealed to us.

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:33.319
It's interesting, as Nehemiah gets into the city,

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:35.279
it says in verse number 11 of chapter two,

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:37.879
so I came to Jerusalem, I was there three days,

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:40.959
and we find that he begins to examine and go through

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:43.719
and begin to, I guess, get a report, if you will,

00:17:43.719 --> 00:17:44.959
of what was going on,

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:48.119
and we find that he then reveals

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:50.719
what it is that God has put in his heart.

00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:53.319
It's recorded for us in verses 17 and 18.

00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:55.119
The enemy is made known,

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:57.559
and remember, Nehemiah answered them and said,

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:01.759
the God of heaven, He will prosper us.

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:04.799
So we've got to remember the power of God.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:09.119
See, where we focus in the time of our adversity,

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:13.319
that we understand that our God is the Lord God Omnipotent

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:15.439
and that He reigns and He rules,

00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:16.799
and we find that Nehemiah says,

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:19.399
be not ye afraid of them.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.799
Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible.

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.359
We find that he's reminding them,

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:27.159
yes, we understand there's an enemy,

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:28.639
we understand they have a plan,

00:18:28.639 --> 00:18:29.599
we understand what's going on,

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:32.839
but no, God brought their counsel to naught.

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:34.719
Why? Because we prayed.

00:18:34.719 --> 00:18:37.759
We saw what God is able to do.

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:40.320
And he reminded them,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.519
at the end of verse number 20,

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:46.039
our God shall fight for us.

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:48.599
We find many times, especially in the Old Testament,

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:52.719
it's noted the battle is the Lord's.

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:55.239
The battle is the Lord's.

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:59.799
And yes, we are to go in the power of God,

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:01.479
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might,

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:03.119
put on the whole armor of God,

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:05.239
and we understand that we are soldiers

00:19:05.239 --> 00:19:09.239
and we are called to be engaged in the battle,

00:19:09.239 --> 00:19:10.919
the spiritual battle that's taking place.

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:13.399
We acknowledge our enemy and what he seeks to do,

00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:16.039
but we must understand that we go not in our own power,

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:17.759
but we go in the power of God.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:21.119
The songwriter said the armor of flesh will fail you.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:25.079
The songwriter was accurate in understanding that truth.

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.279
Remember, it was the Apostle Paul,

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:28.279
he said, I know that in me that is in my flesh

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:29.679
dwelleth no good thing.

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:32.039
He said this, he said, the things that I would, I do not.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.919
The things I would not, that I do.

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.519
I mean, he understood the struggle

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:37.679
and all that goes with it,

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:41.679
but he said that the Lord would give victory,

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:43.159
that we are conquerors,

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:46.279
more than conquerors through Christ.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:47.320
We see their enemy.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.559
They have a plan.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:51.000
The people of God pray.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.679
The power of God is noted.

00:19:52.719 --> 00:19:56.359
And I want you to notice as we conclude the chapter,

00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:58.959
note the persistence of God's people.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:02.379
The Bible says at the end of v. 15,

00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:04.499
notice what it says after it tells us

00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:06.859
how God brought their counsel to naught,

00:20:06.859 --> 00:20:10.359
that we returned all of us to the wall,

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:14.219
every one unto his work.

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:16.979
See, God had a plan and a purpose

00:20:16.979 --> 00:20:18.979
for this work that is recorded for us,

00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:21.599
this historical account that is given to us

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.759
in the book of Nehemiah,

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.059
the rebuilding of the walls.

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.479
Remember, we revealed to you there

00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:28.779
in the beginning of the book of Nehemiah

00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:31.439
how that he inquired and he received word

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.399
that the people, yes, they were in great affliction

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.539
and reproach, but the wall of Jerusalem

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:37.739
was broken down.

00:20:37.739 --> 00:20:39.739
The gates were burned with fire.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.679
And as we begin to look at the work

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:44.979
that God had given Nehemiah to be engaged in,

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:46.619
it was to do this work.

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:49.639
He tells us there in chapter 2

00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:52.559
that the people, they had a mind to work.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:55.239
And what a blessing to understand

00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:58.559
how they got back to the work.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.199
It came to pass in v. 16,

00:21:00.199 --> 00:21:02.019
from that time forth,

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:04.319
that the half of My servants wrought in the work

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:05.919
and the other half of them held

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:08.599
both the spears, the shields, the bows,

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:10.519
the habergens, and the rulers

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.699
were behind all the house of Judah.

00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:14.199
They which builded on the wall

00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:15.599
and they that bear burdens

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:16.999
with those that laid it.

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:18.699
Everyone with one of his hands

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:19.799
wrought in the work

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:21.999
and with the other hand held a weapon.

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:24.899
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:26.939
There was an enemy.

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:29.299
An enemy was seeking to cause the work to cease.

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:30.999
That was their goal.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.959
And so they prayed and they were persistent.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.159
They got back. They persevered.

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.559
They got back into the work.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.079
They were going to move forward.

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.759
They understand there was an enemy.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.839
And so, Nehemiah devises this plan

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:44.439
and they're working and they have

00:21:44.439 --> 00:21:46.919
everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:49.839
and with the other hand held a weapon.

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:51.519
The Bible says that the builders,

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.739
everyone in v. 18,

00:21:52.739 --> 00:21:54.279
had a sword girded by his side

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.459
and so builded.

00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:57.319
And he that sounded the trumpet was by me

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.099
and I said unto the nobles and to the rulers

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:00.459
and to the rest of the people,

00:22:00.459 --> 00:22:01.799
the work is great and large

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:03.259
and we are separated upon the wall

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:06.659
one far from another.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.399
In what place, therefore, you hear the sound of the trumpet?

00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:11.419
Resort ye thither unto us.

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:12.899
Our God shall fight for us.

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:14.379
Notice v. 21,

00:22:14.379 --> 00:22:17.699
so we labored in the work.

00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:19.379
And half of them held the spears

00:22:19.379 --> 00:22:20.599
from the rising of the morning

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.739
till the stars appeared.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:23.899
Likewise, at the same time, said I unto the people,

00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:25.179
and everyone with his servant

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:26.459
lodged within Jerusalem,

00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:28.699
that in the night they may be a guard to us

00:22:28.699 --> 00:22:29.739
and labor on the day.

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:31.179
So neither I nor my brethren

00:22:31.179 --> 00:22:33.619
nor my servants nor the men of the guard

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:34.659
which followed me,

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:36.199
none of us put off our clothes,

00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:39.959
saving that everyone put them off for washing.

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:41.919
I want to note something that's interesting

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.239
as to the work that they're engaged in.

00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:45.879
Now, we're engaged in a work

00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:47.379
that's a different work than the work

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:48.379
that they're engaged in.

00:22:48.379 --> 00:22:50.179
We're not building a wall.

00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:52.579
And that's not the work that we're doing.

00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:54.819
We have a work to do.

00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:56.059
Amen?

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:58.099
And remember, Paul said that we are

00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:00.159
laborers together with God.

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.739
We're to put our hand to the plow.

00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:04.059
We're to be engaged in the work of the Lord

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:06.019
and the service of the King.

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:07.819
And what a blessing it is to be able

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:10.259
to be engaged in the work that God is doing

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:12.659
and to be a co-laborer,

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:14.859
to labor together with God.

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:17.339
And we understand that as we're engaged

00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:19.859
in this work that God has given us,

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:23.379
that we have a task to do

00:23:23.379 --> 00:23:25.459
and that we have an enemy.

00:23:25.459 --> 00:23:27.499
Many adversaries, Paul said,

00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:29.979
we have an enemy that would like to hinder us,

00:23:29.979 --> 00:23:32.739
that would like to cause the work to cease,

00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:35.419
but we prevail, we persist,

00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:37.339
we continue to move forward.

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:39.339
And we note that the Bible tells us

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:42.539
something interesting in verse number 18.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:46.739
And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

00:23:46.739 --> 00:23:48.859
And then it tells us in verse number 20,

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:50.899
in what place therefore ye hear

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:52.539
the sound of the trumpet,

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:54.619
resort ye thither unto us,

00:23:54.619 --> 00:23:56.219
our God shall fight for us.

00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:57.819
And it reminds me as I would make

00:23:57.819 --> 00:23:59.499
spiritual application this evening

00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:00.899
and begin to think about our own lives

00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:02.299
and the ministry that we're engaged in

00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:03.699
and the work that we're doing,

00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:06.379
I'm thankful that even as we look here

00:24:06.379 --> 00:24:08.859
and he says that there were all of these people

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:10.139
that we're building,

00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:13.379
and he says that the work is great and large,

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:15.099
and we are separated upon the wall

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:17.579
one from another in verse number 19.

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:19.499
The work that we're engaged in is a great work.

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:20.859
It's the Lord's work.

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.699
We're not building a wall,

00:24:23.699 --> 00:24:26.539
but if we could make the application this evening,

00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:28.739
I am thankful that there are local churches

00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:31.179
all around the globe

00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:33.699
that are seeking to do the work of the Lord,

00:24:33.699 --> 00:24:35.579
that understand that our responsibility

00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:37.979
is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:24:37.979 --> 00:24:41.339
It's the only hope for mankind.

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:42.939
The only hope.

00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:44.979
And we preach the gospel

00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:47.739
in every place that we can go.

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.419
It works on every continent of the world.

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:53.139
It works for any people group around the globe,

00:24:53.139 --> 00:24:56.139
and we preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:24:56.139 --> 00:24:58.579
and we are engaged in that work.

00:24:58.579 --> 00:24:59.859
Now, I'm thankful.

00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:01.019
Listen, the reality,

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:02.739
yes, there are churches that are closing.

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:04.899
There are churches that are faltering

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:05.739
and so on and so forth,

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:08.299
but there are good churches around the globe.

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:11.059
There are good churches here in our county.

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:12.659
There are good churches in Virginia.

00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:15.219
There are good churches in the United States of America.

00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:17.059
There are good churches all around the globe.

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:20.139
We're all engaged in the same great work.

00:25:20.139 --> 00:25:22.379
We're not all together in the same place,

00:25:22.379 --> 00:25:24.339
but we're all engaged in the great work.

00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:26.019
And here's the reality

00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:29.299
that we're engaged in the work until when?

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:31.619
Until the trumpet of the Lord shall sound.

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:33.579
Amen?

00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:37.179
Remember, at the end of the church age,

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:40.379
there's this wonderful thing that we call the rapture.

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:42.019
Some people criticize the rapture

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:43.979
because they say the word's not in the Bible.

00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:46.419
Well, the word means caught up.

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:50.019
And the Bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:51.259
for this we say unto you,

00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:52.579
by the word of the Lord,

00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:54.099
that we which are alive and remain

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:55.579
unto the coming of the Lord

00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:57.459
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:25:57.459 --> 00:25:59.939
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:02.619
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:03.579
with what?

00:26:03.579 --> 00:26:05.939
With the trump of God.

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.219
And the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:09.619
You know what Nehemiah said?

00:26:09.659 --> 00:26:11.819
There's one that's near me with a trumpet.

00:26:13.219 --> 00:26:15.419
And when the trumpet sounds,

00:26:15.419 --> 00:26:17.739
everyone retreats together to this place

00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:19.699
and the Lord's gonna fight for us.

00:26:20.819 --> 00:26:25.459
And we find here that they were to be engaged in the work

00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.139
until they heard the sound of the trumpet.

00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:31.619
And I tell you, we're to be engaged in the work

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:33.979
until we hear the sound of the trumpet.

00:26:33.979 --> 00:26:34.819
The songwriter said,

00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:35.899
I don't know who wrote the song.

00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:37.139
We've sung it many times.

00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:38.779
Listen for the trumpet.

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:40.339
Jesus is coming.

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:41.339
And He is.

00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:44.139
But we're not just sitting around

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:46.859
doing nothing waiting to hear the trumpet.

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:49.619
We're to be engaged in the work of the Lord,

00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:50.819
redeeming the time.

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:51.659
Why?

00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:52.499
For the days are evil.

00:26:52.499 --> 00:26:55.019
Can we not see that the days are evil?

00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:58.139
Oh, that we'd put our hand to the plow

00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.179
and get engaged in the work,

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:02.099
understanding what God has for us.

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:05.019
And we're just working until we hear the trumpet.

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:07.259
And when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:11.099
man, we're going to heaven, amen.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:12.379
The rapture of the church.

00:27:12.379 --> 00:27:14.139
We're out of here.

00:27:14.139 --> 00:27:16.419
Starts the seven year tribulation.

00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:20.059
By the way, when you think about that understanding

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:21.979
prophetically of the book of Revelation,

00:27:21.979 --> 00:27:23.579
you see all that takes place.

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:25.419
It's there in Revelation chapter number four,

00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:28.219
chapters two and three deal with the seven churches in Asia.

00:27:28.219 --> 00:27:29.219
The letters are written.

00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:31.779
All of the information is given to those churches.

00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:34.019
Yes, they were historical, literal churches

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.579
that were in those locales.

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:37.539
The message that is given to those churches

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:40.299
is applicable for churches even still today.

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:42.499
And it's important that we're mindful of the message.

00:27:42.499 --> 00:27:44.579
But in chapter number four of the book of Revelation,

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:48.619
we find the Bible tells us that John, he heard a voice.

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:52.019
And the Bible tells us that the voice that he heard

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:54.659
said this, come up hither.

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:00.939
Begin to look at the passages in Revelation

00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:04.419
that are recorded after this event.

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:07.419
Begin to speak about the tribulation period.

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:09.619
How God is working.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:13.819
And how God is bringing His people Israel

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:17.339
to a place of acknowledging who He is as the Messiah.

00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:19.779
We don't have time this evening to get into

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:21.939
all the eschatology.

00:28:21.939 --> 00:28:24.059
But I want you to understand from the book of Nehemiah

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:24.899
in the fourth chapter,

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:26.859
I want you to be encouraged this evening.

00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:28.619
You say, how can we be encouraged with a title

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.579
like there are many adversaries?

00:28:30.579 --> 00:28:33.379
I thought the same thing as I was preparing, amen?

00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:35.859
But the reality is that we can be encouraged

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.979
because we're more than conquerors in Christ

00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:39.179
or through Christ.

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:42.099
We can be encouraged because we have a work

00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:43.499
to be engaged in.

00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:47.139
And the work that we're engaged in is a great work.

00:28:47.139 --> 00:28:49.739
And when the work that we're engaged in,

00:28:49.739 --> 00:28:51.539
when Jesus is gonna come,

00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:55.659
He's gonna come with the trumpet is going to sound.

00:28:55.659 --> 00:28:59.179
We read there in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:03.019
but we find also there in 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:29:03.459 --> 00:29:05.139
behold, verse 51, I show you a mystery.

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:09.379
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:10.939
In a moment, the twinkling of an eye,

00:29:10.939 --> 00:29:14.859
at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound.

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:16.579
The dead shall be raised incorruptible

00:29:16.579 --> 00:29:19.659
and we shall be changed.

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:23.899
For this corruptible must put on incorruption

00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:27.739
and this mortal must put on immortality.

00:29:27.739 --> 00:29:32.499
Can I tell you, if I can put myself in the place of Nehemiah,

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:36.619
if I can put myself into the dialogue

00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:38.659
of chapter number four of the book of Nehemiah,

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:40.539
they're working and they're working.

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:42.979
And if there's a group of people that come over

00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:45.379
and come to where Nehemiah is,

00:29:45.379 --> 00:29:46.899
Nehemiah says, what are you doing?

00:29:46.899 --> 00:29:49.859
You didn't hear the trumpet sound, did you?

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:52.459
You stay engaged in the work.

00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:53.899
The trumpet didn't sound.

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:58.379
But when he said that the one that sounded the trumpet

00:29:58.379 --> 00:29:59.219
was Biden.

00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:03.659
me. And so if there was a need for them because of the fact that there was a

00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:07.659
level of vulnerability from a physical perspective because the work was great

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:12.059
and large they were separated upon the wall far from one another that if they

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:16.579
needed to all retreat and come to one place that Nehemiah would give the

00:30:16.579 --> 00:30:21.019
signal and the trumpet would sound. And that's when they're all supposed to come

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:25.499
back to that place. And so if they start trying to retreat and get out of the

00:30:25.499 --> 00:30:30.939
work and just want to be near Nehemiah and he says no no no go work. The trumpet

00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:36.939
hasn't sounded. And for us New Testament believers as we understand if we could

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:42.099
make an application this evening listen the trumpet hasn't sounded. There's some

00:30:42.099 --> 00:30:45.379
people out there trying to tell you that the return of Christ already took place

00:30:45.379 --> 00:30:50.699
they needed to read their Bibles again. Amen.

00:30:50.939 --> 00:30:55.979
Jesus listen the rapture hasn't taken place he hasn't returned yet. He's coming.

00:30:55.979 --> 00:31:05.459
The return of the Lord draweth nigh. He's coming. We'll hear the trumpet. The

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:10.219
Bible tells us that we'll ever be with him. What a blessing. But until the

00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:17.299
trumpet sounds we got to work. We got to work. The work that God's given us is a

00:31:17.299 --> 00:31:23.459
great work. It's the work of preaching the gospel to every creature. Think about

00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:30.979
that. 7 billion almost 8 billion people on our earth. A lot of people. It's a

00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:36.259
great work. We continue to send people out. We continue to go out into our

00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:44.139
community and around the world to do the work of God. When the work or excuse me

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:49.619
when the trumpet sounds we're gone in a moment twinkling of an eye. The work is

00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:56.619
finished. Until then redeem the time. Get engaged in the work of the Lord. There

00:31:56.619 --> 00:32:00.699
are many adversaries. He wants you to quit. He really likes you to just not

00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:05.459
even get engaged in the work. Just be on the sidelines. Say yeah I don't know if I

00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:11.779
want to get engaged in that. It's too too difficult, too hard, too whatever. No no.

00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:18.139
We say we we've been enlisted in the army. Last week we looked at Archippus

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:23.899
right. He is a good soldier. A fellow soldier. What a blessing. Oh that God

00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:29.499
would help us to be engaged in the work of the Lord. Father we love you. We thank

00:32:29.499 --> 00:32:32.619
you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God. The truth contained therein.

00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:37.819
I pray God that you would help us to understand the historical account that

00:32:37.819 --> 00:32:42.219
is given to us. I'm thankful to report that in chapter number six the book of

00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:47.019
Nehemiah that it records for us that the walls were finished. What a blessing. Oh

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:59.459
the enemy continued to fight and to oppose and used different tactics. People

00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:04.099
were persistent under the leadership of Nehemiah as he followed you as they

00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:09.939
prayed. God we thank you for your power. We thank you for bringing it to pass.

00:33:09.939 --> 00:33:14.779
Lord I pray as we consider an application for us this evening that

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:20.779
we'd understand that we're engaged in a work and it's a great work. It's an

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:25.659
honorable work. It's the greatest work to be able to give the gospel of Jesus

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:30.899
Christ which is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.

00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:37.779
Lord I pray you'd help us to be faithful until the trumpet of the Lord shall

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:44.619
sound. We thank you for the truth that Jesus is coming and indeed we are

00:33:44.619 --> 00:33:53.499
listening for the trumpet but I pray that you'd help us to be faithfully involved

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:57.979
in the work you've given us to do that we'd redeem the time. Understand that the

00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:05.499
days are evil. Use us God in such a way that eternity would be impacted and you

00:34:05.499 --> 00:34:11.939
would be glorified. Well thank you for it in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
