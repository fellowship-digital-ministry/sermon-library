1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
be in 2 Kings 5, 2 Kings 5, verses 20-27 will be our text this evening.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,300
Those of you that were with us last week, you'll remember that we studied the miraculous

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,479
healing of Naaman.

4
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:21,000
Through the providence of God, Naaman was made aware of the prophet of God in Samaria.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,959
You'll remember with me that as we studied several weeks ago, the first several verses

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:32,520
of 2 Kings 5, how there was that little maid that had been taken captive into Syria, and

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,119
as she was there, she spoke up and said to her mistress, would God, my Lord, were with

8
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,279
the prophet that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his leprosy.

9
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:50,680
This little maid was confident in her belief, and she evidently had effectively communicated

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,000
her confidence to the wife of Naaman, and then obviously to Naaman, letters were written,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,940
and eventually, we find that Naaman traveled to go right to the house of Elisha, and as

12
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,760
you recall from last Wednesday evening, we spoke about the way in which he stood at the

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,120
door of the house of Elisha that was Naaman, and of course, as we would deal with the meeting

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,800
that occurred between Elisha and Naaman, we find that Elisha sent a messenger, and

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,440
in sending a messenger, Elisha gave him some very specific, simple instruction.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,839
I mean, it was simple, it was specific, here was the instruction, go and wash in Jordan

17
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:40,319
seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,319
Nothing difficult, nothing confusing, very simple, but yet very specific as to the instruction

19
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,319
that was given.

20
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,800
Eventually, at the prodding of his servants, we read that Naaman obeyed the instruction

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,279
that was given by the messenger of Elisha, and he went down to the river, and went down

22
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:03,540
to Jordan, he dipped himself seven times, and was miraculously healed.

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,320
We find that he offered some gifts, and some things transpired there, and then he would

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,800
gather two mules burden of earth, and head back to Syria.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,160
And as he headed back to Syria, is where we pick up our text of Scripture this evening,

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,559
in chapter number five of the book of 2 Kings, beginning in verse number 20, we find that

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:29,679
now the attention of this passage of Scripture turns to the servant of Elisha, Gehazi.

28
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:36,479
Notice in verse number 20, but Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, behold,

29
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,880
my master hath spared Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
brought.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,080
But, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,199
So Gehazi followed after Naaman, and when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted

33
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,240
down from the chariot to meet him, and said, is all well.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,960
And he said, this is Gehazi speaking in verse 22, all is well.

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,960
My master hath sent me, saying, behold, even now there be come to me from Mount Ephraim

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,080
two young men of the sons of the prophets, give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver

37
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,119
and two changes of garments.

38
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,520
And Naaman said, be content, take two talents.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,479
And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments,

40
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,479
and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bare them before him.

41
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,720
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
house.

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,580
And he let the men go, and they departed.

44
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,520
But he went in, and stood before his master.

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,240
And Elisha said unto him, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,880
And he said, thy servant went no whither.

47
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,320
And he, Elisha, said unto him, Gehazi, went not mine heart with thee?

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,720
When the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee, is it a time to receive money,

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,160
and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants,

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,919
and maidservants?

51
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,359
The leprosy thereof of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed forever.

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,320
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow."

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,119
Just as exciting and miraculous as our last text of Scripture was in our study of the

54
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:39,959
life of Elisha, when we come to this, our 25th lesson, dealing with the life and ministry

55
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,799
of Elijah and now Elisha, we find that just as exciting as our last study was and miraculous

56
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:53,839
that we come to this study and oh, the sadness, the unfortunate circumstances that are recorded

57
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:59,119
for us in this text of Scripture, and really, it didn't have to be this way.

58
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:04,119
But Gehazi made some decisions, and the decisions that he made were not good decisions, not

59
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,399
right decisions, and we find that the text of Scripture records for us the behavior of

60
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,600
this man Gehazi.

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,920
If you're taking notes this evening, I'd give you the title, Gehazi Followed After

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Naaman.

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,260
Gehazi Followed After Naaman.

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,359
As we look at the text of Scripture, I want you to consider with me first of all this

65
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,320
evening if you're taking notes, consider his conduct.

66
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:35,079
Really, in verses 20-25, we see that God gives us a record of the conduct of this man Gehazi.

67
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,399
We find that in verse 20, the very first thing that happens is he entertains an evil

68
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,600
thought.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,839
We find that in verse 20, the servant of Elisha, this man Gehazi, look at what he says.

70
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,880
He says, Behold, my servant hath spared Naaman the Syrian, and not receiving at his hands

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,179
that which he brought.

72
00:05:56,179 --> 00:06:01,619
You remember this is a reference back to verse 15, after the healing of Naaman, Naaman comes

73
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:06,220
to Elisha, and they return back to the house of Elisha, and at the end of the verse in

74
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,660
verse 15, it says, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel.

75
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,500
Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,899
But he, Elisha, said, As the Lord liveth before whom I stand, I will receive none.

77
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,100
And he urged him to take it, but he, Elisha, refused.

78
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,779
He, Naaman, was persistent on seeking to give a blessing, a gift, and Elisha said,

79
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:34,540
No way, I'm not taking it.

80
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,380
But we find that Gehazi entertains this thought.

81
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:46,059
He begins to entertain the idea that, Man, we missed out on an opportunity to get something.

82
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:51,500
Naaman was offering something, and he was persistent on his offering, and, Man, we could

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,940
have gotten some gain.

84
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,380
We find that he entertains that evil thought, which leads to devising a deceptive plan.

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,140
It's amazing to me, as we look at the text of Scripture, I mean, it's not long a period

86
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,059
of time that transpires, I mean, the Bible tells us that there, at the end of our study

87
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:20,059
of last week, in verses 17 through 19, that Naaman desired that two mules burden of earth,

88
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:24,579
you'll remember, and then he was going to depart, and it says there in verse 19, he

89
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,540
said unto him, Go in peace, so he departed from him a little way.

90
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,619
But Gehazi, I mean, this was a very quick process of time that takes place, and in just

91
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:39,380
a moment of time, just a short period of time would lapse, that Gehazi devises this deceptive

92
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,940
plan.

93
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,299
It's really interesting, as you consider the detail contained within the plan.

94
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:51,339
I mean, when you consider that Gehazi had entertained this evil thought of how he could

95
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:57,380
gain, get gain, and how he could go and receive something from the hand of Naaman, he's devising

96
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
this plan.

97
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,260
He says at the end of verse number 20, but as the Lord liveth, I will run after him and

98
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,500
take somewhat of him.

99
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,339
But what's he going to say to Naaman?

100
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,380
I mean, what's his plan going to be?

101
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,779
I mean, Naaman had already offered to Elisha to give him a blessing, and Elisha refused.

102
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:24,220
And though Naaman urged him in persistence, we find that Elisha refused.

103
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,420
So Gehazi, he devises this deceptive plan, and he runs after Naaman.

104
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,559
The Bible tells us in verse number 21 that he followed after Naaman, notice, and when

105
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,979
Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said,

106
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,820
is all well.

107
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,500
We find that in verse number 21, again, in your mind's eye, if you can see it, they first

108
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,419
arrived there, that group of people, according to verse number nine, that traveled with Naaman,

109
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,820
they arrived at the house of Elisha.

110
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,780
And we find that Elisha departed, excuse me, Naaman departed from the house of Elisha and

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,299
eventually went down there to the Jordan to dip seven times in Jordan.

112
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,820
And then he returns back to Elisha's house, and that's where the interaction is recorded

113
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,020
in verses 15 through 19.

114
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,940
And now Naaman has departed and Naaman is leaving with that host of people that came

115
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,460
from Syria, and here's Gehazi chasing him.

116
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,900
Gehazi's running after him.

117
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,179
We find that Naaman recognizes, he sees, he notices that there's someone pursuing.

118
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:36,059
And so Naaman gives the command for the chariot to stop, and he comes down from the chariot

119
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,380
and he says, is all well.

120
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,020
This is what Gehazi says, all is well, all is well.

121
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:53,900
And then I want you to see how quickly he begins to devise or to put in play, to put

122
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,380
in motion this plan, this wicked, deceptive plan that he devised.

123
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
He says,

124
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,920
Number one, my Master hath sent me.

125
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,380
Did Elisha send Naaman?

126
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,580
No.

127
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,140
I believe that Gehazi understood

128
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,780
that if he said to Naaman that Elisha sent me,

129
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,060
that he'd probably get what he wanted.

130
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
So he says to Naaman,

131
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,760
he says,

132
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
Elisha sent me.

133
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,120
My Master hath sent me.

134
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,320
Verse 22, and then notice, saying,

135
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,740
Behold, even now there be come to me

136
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,380
from Mount Ephraim two young men

137
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,860
of the sons of the prophets.

138
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,180
Wow.

139
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,480
Further down the path of lying, right?

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
Elisha had not commanded Gehazi to go.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Two men from Ephraim from the schools of the prophets

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,900
or the sons of the prophets,

143
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,560
they did not come in need of these things.

144
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,120
But we find that Gehazi has devised this plan.

145
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Isn't it amazing

146
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,460
when you think about the nature of human beings?

147
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,840
I mean, just the wickedness,

148
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,160
the depravity of our hearts.

149
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,580
The Bible talks about the fact

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,900
that our hearts are deceitful

151
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,040
and desperately wicked.

152
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,140
Who can know it?

153
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,640
And we find here that this man Gehazi

154
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,880
very quickly, I mean, on the run so to speak,

155
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,480
he's just making this stuff up.

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,440
He's just totally lying about what was taking place.

157
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,880
And he speaks to Naaman.

158
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,180
And then he says, okay, so here's the deal, Naaman.

159
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,500
My Master sent me.

160
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
Elisha sent me.

161
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,660
There's two men, two young men

162
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,220
that are from the sons of the prophets

163
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,180
that have come.

164
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,340
And here's what we need.

165
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,580
Give them, I pray thee,

166
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,300
a talent of silver

167
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,700
and two changes of garments.

168
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,020
So, Gehazi was present

169
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,740
when Naaman had offered a blessing to Elisha.

170
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,580
And we find that he now comes

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,560
and he says, here's what we need.

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,160
We need a talent of silver

173
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,820
and two changes of garments.

174
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Notice what Naaman says.

175
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,240
I mean, Naaman's very willing to give.

176
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,880
He says, be content.

177
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,480
Take two talents.

178
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
You only asked for one, take two.

179
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
He says this,

180
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,520
and he urged him,

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,000
and bound two talents of silver

182
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,220
and two bags with two changes of garments.

183
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,059
Notice this,

184
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,180
and laid them upon two of his servants

185
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,900
and they bared them before him.

186
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,020
Gehazi didn't even carry the stuff back.

187
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,700
The two servants of Naaman

188
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,460
are the ones that bring it back to the tower

189
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,940
that is mentioned in verse number 24.

190
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,260
And so we find that now Gehazi receives the goods.

191
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,940
He had devised this deceptive plan.

192
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,340
He shows up, he goes running after the chariot of Naaman

193
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,300
and Naaman sees that Gehazi is coming.

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
He stops, he says, it's all well.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
And he says, all is well.

196
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,740
My master has sent me

197
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,480
and there's these two young men

198
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,279
that have come from the sons of the prophets

199
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,160
and they need some money and some clothes.

200
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
And Naaman says, be content.

201
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
Here, have two talents of silver.

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Here are two changes of garments.

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,919
And we find that they're carried there.

204
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,800
He says that he laid them upon two of his servants

205
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,919
and they bared them before him.

206
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,440
Notice verse 24.

207
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
And when he came to the tower,

208
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
he took them from their hand.

209
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,279
Does that ever make of interest to you?

210
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,139
If this thing were, of course, true,

211
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,660
Gehazi wouldn't have minded

212
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,620
if they brought it all the way back to the house, would he?

213
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,260
What's he trying to do?

214
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,900
He's trying to cover up for himself, right?

215
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,300
He understands what he's doing.

216
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,139
He knows that this thing is a lie.

217
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,660
He knows that Elisha had not sent him.

218
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,139
And the Bible says that he took them from their hand.

219
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,180
Notice this in verse 24,

220
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,700
and bestowed them in the house.

221
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,760
And he let the men go and they departed.

222
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
And so he brings them into the house.

223
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm not sure, as he leaves the goods in the house,

224
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm not sure where he put them in the house.

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm not sure if it's a situation

226
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,840
such as you read of Achan there in the book of Joshua,

227
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,000
where he hid them in his tent,

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,600
that which he was not allowed to take.

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,639
And we find here that he brings them,

230
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,139
he bestows them in the house.

231
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,680
But I want you to notice what happens in verse number 25

232
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,640
as we continue to consider the conduct of this man, Naaman.

233
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,420
It says, but he went in and stood before his master.

234
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,119
Can you imagine?

235
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:32,080
He just did all of this that is recorded for us.

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,920
Lied.

237
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,160
Took that which he wasn't really supposed to take.

238
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,600
Received it through the lie that he gave.

239
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,080
And the man Naaman believed something that was not true.

240
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,760
And we find that then he goes

241
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,839
and he stands before Elisha,

242
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,959
seemingly without even a guilty conscience

243
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
of what he just did.

244
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,679
We consider his conduct.

245
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,080
I want you to consider the consequences.

246
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
The Bible says in verse number 25

247
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,320
that Elijah said unto him,

248
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Whence comest thou, Gehazi?

249
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
That's kind of interesting, is it not?

250
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,119
Elisha says to Gehazi,

251
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,480
where have you been?

252
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,800
Whence comest thou?

253
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,399
And notice, Gehazi has to lie again, right?

254
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,959
I mean, he can't tell him the truth.

255
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,520
He can't tell him what he just did.

256
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,119
He can't tell him I've been running after Naaman

257
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,800
so that I could receive some goods.

258
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,880
No, he says, thy servant went no whither.

259
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,080
I didn't go anywhere.

260
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,920
He lies.

261
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,720
This thing spirals out of control.

262
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,080
We find that many have used the analogy

263
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,600
in years gone by about a web of lies

264
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,320
and that whole scenario

265
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,160
that people have painted that picture.

266
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,119
I think it's very appropriate and applicable.

267
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,800
But you find here that Gehazi

268
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,440
got himself into a position

269
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
where there was a probing question.

270
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,239
Whence comest thou, Gehazi?

271
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,959
And he could not say where he came from,

272
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,480
so he has to continue to lie.

273
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,760
And he says I didn't go anywhere.

274
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
My servant went no whither.

275
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,480
Notice, however, that Elisha says to him

276
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,119
in verse 26,

277
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:24,000
went not mine heart with thee?

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,880
When the man turned again from his chariot

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,760
to meet thee?

280
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,119
Now, I want you to put yourself

281
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,160
in the position of Gehazi at this moment.

282
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
You've got to loosen your collar, right?

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,320
I mean, it's getting hot.

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,119
It's like, how does he know?

285
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,959
The thing that I can't quite understand

286
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,800
is Gehazi was the servant of Elisha

287
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,760
and he knew he'd experienced

288
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,800
how God had given Elisha

289
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
so many insights

290
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,559
and even in the situation

291
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,320
that we just read about with Naaman

292
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,640
and all that took place,

293
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,959
and you see how God was using Elisha,

294
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,239
and yet, Gehazi somehow thought

295
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:06,520
that he could get by with this thing.

296
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
And notice that Elisha continues

297
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,720
the series of questions.

298
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,640
He says, is it a time to receive money?

299
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,119
And to receive garments?

300
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,040
Can you imagine?

301
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,279
I mean, those are the two things

302
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,559
he just received, right?

303
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,360
He told Naaman, there's these two guys

304
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,239
that came, these two young men,

305
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,520
and we need a talon of silver

306
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
and two changes of garments.

307
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,920
And here, Elisha says, is it time?

308
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,640
Is it a time to receive money

309
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,480
and to receive garments and oliveyards

310
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,880
and vineyards and sheep and oxen

311
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,080
and menservants and maidservants?

312
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,520
We read in verse 27 a sad conclusion.

313
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,239
The Bible says,

314
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:59,040
the leprosy therefore of Naaman

315
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,399
shall cleave unto thee

316
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:06,880
and unto thy seed forever.

317
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,920
And when he went out from the presence,

318
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,080
or in his presence,

319
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,800
a leper as white as snow.

320
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,320
Wow.

321
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,040
That's sad.

322
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,279
You read this particular account

323
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,720
and you read what happened,

324
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,920
and you see the consequences

325
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,839
it's given to us in verse 27,

326
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,679
and you understand as you study

327
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,839
the passage of Scripture

328
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,520
why that happened.

329
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
If you were to just read verse 27

330
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,000
and see that this man Gehazi

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,799
left the presence of Elisha

332
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,679
being a leper as white as snow,

333
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,880
you'd say what happened?

334
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
What is going on?

335
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Why did this transpire?

336
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,000
You go back and you begin reading

337
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
in verses 20-25

338
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,559
and you see the behavior,

339
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,359
the conduct of Gehazi,

340
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,200
and you see the consequence,

341
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,559
the punishment, the judgment

342
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,000
that is there upon Gehazi.

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,359
As we look at a passage of Scripture

344
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,880
like this, I believe there's some lessons

345
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,799
for us to learn.

346
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,080
I believe, in fact,

347
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,679
that there are some valuable lessons

348
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,080
for us to learn.

349
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
Obviously, we could close the Scriptures

350
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,200
and say, don't do as Gehazi did.

351
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
That would be good counsel, amen?

352
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,599
But let me just give you three thoughts

353
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,599
this evening as we conclude

354
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,400
and just give you three lessons

355
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,039
I believe that would be applicable

356
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,280
for each of us today.

357
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,479
Number one, guard your thoughts.

358
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:24,200
Guard your thoughts.

359
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,599
See, it all started with an evil thought,

360
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,799
did it not?

361
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,640
He entertained this thought,

362
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,400
hey, you know what?

363
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,160
I can go get something.

364
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,000
And he had this thought.

365
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,599
Someone said this,

366
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,919
thoughts lead to actions.

367
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,359
Thoughts lead to actions.

368
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,679
Gehazi thought, Naaman's leaving.

369
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,880
We could have gotten some money.

370
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,960
We could have gotten some whatever.

371
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,799
I don't want him to leave

372
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,000
without getting something,

373
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,280
so he devises this plan.

374
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
It started with a thought.

375
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,599
Thoughts lead to actions.

376
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,599
Notice in the New Testament

377
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,599
as we consider this,

378
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,159
truth of guarding your thoughts, turn to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will, we'll

379
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:13,399
look at two passages of Scripture here in the New Testament with regard to our thoughts.

380
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,139
Our thoughts are important.

381
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:22,459
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10 and verse number 3, for though we walk in the flesh,

382
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,779
we do not war after the flesh.

383
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,659
Verse 4, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling

384
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,419
down of strongholds.

385
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,859
Notice verse number 5 of 2 Corinthians 10, casting down imaginations and every high

386
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:44,059
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought

387
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,779
to the obedience of Christ.

388
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:53,979
See the reality this evening as we would consider some lessons from this passage in 2 Kings

389
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:57,099
chapter 5 is that we need to guard our thoughts.

390
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:04,099
See this evening, there's nothing maybe that we could deal with in life as we look at this

391
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:09,379
circumstance of Gehazi and Naaman and there might not be anything specific in that particular

392
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,459
regard that we would face, but we find that as we go through life that there are times

393
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:16,459
that thoughts enter our minds.

394
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:21,979
It's important that we guard, that we do as it says at the end of verse number 5 and bringing

395
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:28,419
into captivity every thought, notice, to the obedience of Christ.

396
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,539
If you have a thought that's going to lead to an action that's going to require deception,

397
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,059
it's definitely not in the obedience of Christ.

398
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,059
Amen?

399
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:42,659
And so we find that there's this truth that we have as New Testament believers in understanding

400
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,459
the importance of bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ over

401
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:53,699
in the book of Philippians in chapter number 4, verse number 8, it's a familiar verse of

402
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:59,819
Scripture that speaks about those things that we are to think on.

403
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,539
In Philippians 4 and verse number 8, finally my brethren, what sort of things are true?

404
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,219
What sort of things are honest?

405
00:22:06,219 --> 00:22:07,419
What sort of things are just?

406
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,819
What sort of things are pure?

407
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,139
What sort of things are lovely?

408
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,099
What sort of things are of good report?

409
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:19,219
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things.

410
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,539
The very first thing, what sort of things are true?

411
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,939
Gehazi had to make up all these lies, right?

412
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:28,739
He started out by saying, my master sendeth me.

413
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:30,619
No, he didn't.

414
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,419
Elisha never told you to go anywhere.

415
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:39,299
And so we find that there's a lesson, a valuable application for us this evening as we study

416
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:43,979
2 Kings chapter number 5, number 1, that we guard our thoughts, number 2, that we guard

417
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,219
our tongue.

418
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:51,219
See, his thoughts led to actions, but then his tongue got him in all kinds of trouble.

419
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:56,219
He ran after the chariot, and once he did, he begins lying.

420
00:22:56,219 --> 00:23:00,339
And that lying spiraled out of control to the point where he lied about why he was there

421
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:06,339
all is well, he lied about how, why he came, what he needed, he lied to Elisha when he

422
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:08,539
got back to the house of Elisha.

423
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:16,099
He goes and stands before him, and we find that Elisha says, hey, where have you been?

424
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,099
I've not gone anywhere.

425
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:23,219
So we've got to be careful, not only of our thoughts, but of our speech.

426
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,739
Ephesians chapter number 4, we're right here in the book of Philippians, turn to the book

427
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:31,499
of Ephesians, if you will, and notice two verses of Scripture here in Ephesians chapter

428
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:38,219
number 4, and we studied the book of Ephesians in 2019 and looked at this passage pretty

429
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:42,539
extensively during the latter part of our study through the book of Ephesians.

430
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,459
But notice in verse 15, but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him, into him in

431
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,019
all things, which is the head, even Christ.

432
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,839
Skip down to verse number 29, if you will, it says, let no corrupt communication proceed

433
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,719
out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister

434
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,479
grace unto the hearers.

435
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:09,479
David said this in Psalm 19 and verse number 14, let the words of my mouth and the meditation

436
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:16,279
of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

437
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:23,759
See Gehazi, he didn't guard his thoughts, and then he didn't guard his tongue.

438
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:30,679
As he went through with this plan that he devised, as that plan was set in motion, and

439
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,399
we find that he runs after, I mean, he's all in on this plan.

440
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,759
And somehow he thinks that he's going to be able to take those goods and hide them in

441
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,479
the house, he bestowed them in the house, and that he could go into the presence of

442
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:47,679
Elisha and just basically no one would ever know.

443
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,519
But see, the reality is that God knows.

444
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,079
God knows.

445
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,839
The fact of the matter is that here in this passage of Scripture, we read of a historical

446
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,799
account of that which happened in the life of Gehazi, but as we learn that lesson from

447
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:11,679
the life of Gehazi, we apply valuable lessons to us, takeaways, if you will, what can I

448
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,679
learn from this?

449
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,759
Listen, I don't want to deal with the judgment of God.

450
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,999
I don't want to be in that position where I have to experience the chastening hand of

451
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:20,999
the Lord.

452
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,239
So we find that we're to guard our thoughts, guard our tongue, our speech, if you will.

453
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:31,479
And then let me say this, refuse to cover your sin.

454
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,359
Refuse to cover your sin.

455
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:39,359
See, Gehazi knew that he couldn't bring that which he received from the hand of Naaman

456
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,799
back into the presence of Elisha.

457
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,959
That would have been a bad deal.

458
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,479
He knew that he couldn't do that, so he takes them when they get to that tower that's mentioned

459
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,839
in verse 24, he takes them from those two servants, he goes in, and he bestows them

460
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,839
in the house.

461
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,199
Again, I'm not 100% sure what he does with them, but he let the men go and they departed.

462
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:04,159
And see, he goes in, the Bible says, and stood before his master, according to verse number

463
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,519
25.

464
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:15,479
And then even as Elisha begins to ask this probing question, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

465
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:21,279
He still covers, he's trying to cover up that which he's done.

466
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,919
He does not respond with a broken response, a repentant heart, no.

467
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,839
He says, thy servant went no whither.

468
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,639
He continues to lie, to try to cover his sin.

469
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,279
But see, we need to refuse to cover our sin.

470
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,079
I'm mindful of various passages of Scripture in which we find that there are people that

471
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,599
seek to cover their sin.

472
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:49,159
But the reality is that we need to come to that place in our lives where we say, I am

473
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,599
not going to cover my sin.

474
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,559
When there's a question that's asked, a probing question if you will, that I would allow myself

475
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,239
to be sensitive to the convicting work of the Holy Spirit of God.

476
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:08,959
That we would not cause ourselves to be in that position where we have quenched the Spirit

477
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,719
or grieved the Spirit.

478
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:18,159
That we would not have a seared conscience, but that we would be very responsive to the

479
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,039
conviction of the Holy Spirit of God in our lives.

480
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,199
See I believe that when Elisha asks that question how he does, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

481
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:34,359
There's an opportunity for just a moment of time for Gehazi to get right.

482
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,759
I'm not sure exactly how it would have changed the entire outcome of the scenario here, but

483
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,679
the reality is that there was a moment of time in order for him to just get right.

484
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:46,639
You know what?

485
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:49,079
I went and chased after Naaman.

486
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,119
And I lied to him and I told him that you sent me.

487
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,319
I mean I could just imagine the countenance of Elisha as he's hearing this from Gehazi

488
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,039
and Gehazi says, and I told him that there were two young men from the sons of the prophets

489
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,679
that came and they need some money and they need some garments and he gave me two talents

490
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:08,879
of silver and two changes of garments.

491
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:15,719
But no, he said, I didn't go anywhere, so he refused to cover our sin.

492
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:20,039
We find that it seems obvious through the passage of Scripture, not only through the

493
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:25,679
behavior leading up to his interaction there with Elisha, but even at the interaction with

494
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
Elisha that he has seared his conscience.

495
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,439
He just continued to try to cover it up.

496
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:36,159
You know, the Bible says this in Psalm 32 and verse number 1.

497
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,679
What a wonderful verse of Scripture with regard to the blessing of being forgiven.

498
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:52,440
The Bible says, blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

499
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,519
You know, it's a blessing to be forgiven by God.

500
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,479
To know that we've been forgiven.

501
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,719
See, we're not trying to cover up our sin.

502
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:05,979
We're not trying to have this web of lies of who we tell and what we do.

503
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:11,199
And even so, when he has the silver and the garments there in his house, how's he going

504
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,199
to bring it out?

505
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,199
When's he going to bring it out?

506
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,839
How's he ever going to use it?

507
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,599
Is there going to be a question down the line, where did you get that?

508
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,279
See, to be forgiven is a blessing.

509
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,799
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

510
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,399
See, the psalmist understood that truth and then says this, and really it goes hand in

511
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,919
hand in verse number 5, I acknowledged my sin unto thee.

512
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,039
I looked at this just a few weeks ago on Sunday evening with Jeremiah with the importance

513
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,919
of acknowledging thine iniquity.

514
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,799
Verse 5, I acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid.

515
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,599
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity

516
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,799
of my sin, Selah.

517
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,159
And then we find there in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13 that the Bible gives us a

518
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:00,599
very...

519
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:08,319
direct truth with regard to covering our sin and those that confess and forsake.

520
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:15,139
The Bible says in Proverbs 28 and verse 13, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper,

521
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:20,439
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

522
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:32,839
See, the Bible contains historical data, records of God's interaction with mankind, with individuals,

523
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,839
with the nation of Israel, other nations and kingdoms, and so on and so forth, but as we

524
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,559
begin to study those particular accounts, not only do we have the opportunity to learn

525
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:49,159
history and to learn what happened here with Naaman and Gehazi and Elisha, and to see specifically

526
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,639
as the text of Scripture draws its attention to Gehazi and his actions in this text of

527
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:58,959
Scripture, but we find that the Bible gives us these records so that we can learn lessons

528
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:04,159
in our lives, so that we can take application and say, you know what, I see what happened

529
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
to Gehazi, and how could we prevent that from happening?

530
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,599
I don't want the judgment.

531
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:16,259
I think if you asked Gehazi in verse number 15, when all of that interaction was taking

532
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,619
place where Naaman is offering a blessing, if you looked at Gehazi and said, hey listen,

533
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:28,239
if you want something, you can get it, but you're going to get leprosy too.

534
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:32,159
Go ahead and take a blessing from Naaman, but with it comes leprosy.

535
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,939
What do you think Gehazi would have said?

536
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:36,059
No way.

537
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,359
I'm not interested, right?

538
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,019
But the problem is that we don't always know what the consequence is going to be.

539
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,899
We know, be not deceived, God is not mocked, whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also

540
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:48,899
reap.

541
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,379
We know that principle in God's Word.

542
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:55,979
But here's the amazing thing as New Testament believers, but I say even for Gehazi, he had

543
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:59,619
the record of the Garden of Eden, right?

544
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,059
Adam and Eve tried to hide their sin.

545
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,739
They tried to cover it up.

546
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,659
God knew what was going on.

547
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:05,659
Where art thou?

548
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:11,379
That was a probing, convicting question, was it not?

549
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:14,379
We hid ourselves because we were naked.

550
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,179
Who told you that you were naked, right?

551
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:18,619
Isn't that what God says in Genesis 3, right?

552
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:21,559
You know.

553
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,579
We have that record.

554
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:31,459
Gehazi could have known certainly about the situation there with Achan.

555
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:37,539
In fact, the writer of the book of 1 Chronicles names Achan as the troubler of Israel.

556
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,619
Isn't that a wonderful way to be remembered?

557
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,099
The troubler of Israel, Achan.

558
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,099
What did he do?

559
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,099
Well, he saw it.

560
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,099
He desired it.

561
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,099
He took it.

562
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,099
He hid it.

563
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,299
And eventually he was stoned, right?

564
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,019
Joshua 7, terrible.

565
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:00,239
He could have known about the circumstance, the situation with David.

566
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,239
He sees Bathsheba.

567
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,239
Who is she?

568
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,239
Bring her to me.

569
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,739
I want her.

570
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:11,299
And then in just a little while, the prophet of God stands before David, Nathan, and says,

571
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:14,539
David, thou art the man.

572
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:18,659
See, God's given us plenty of examples in His Word.

573
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,579
Ananias and Sapphira, you want a New Testament example?

574
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:22,579
Acts 5.

575
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:26,099
Hey, listen, we're going to sell our property and we're going to tell them we sold it for

576
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,019
this much so we can give it all to God and we're going to really look good.

577
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,899
They devised their plan.

578
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:36,459
God never told them they had to sell their land, by the way.

579
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:39,379
God never told them that if they sold their land, they had to give all the money to the

580
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,099
church.

581
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,739
But they came and they said, here's what we did.

582
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,379
What happened?

583
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:50,419
They died an untimely death from our human perspective.

584
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,219
God judged.

585
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:53,219
What happened?

586
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:56,139
The Bible says that fear fell upon them.

587
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,019
You'd be fearful too.

588
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,299
See, God's given us many examples.

589
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:05,859
And I tell you, often it just starts with a thought, an evil thought, a wrong thought.

590
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:08,219
But thoughts lead to actions.

591
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:14,139
It's so important that we guard our thoughts, that we bring them into captivity to the obedience

592
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,659
of Christ, that we think on these things that are mentioned in Philippians 4.

593
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,739
Because why?

594
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,739
Because it starts with a thought.

595
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,099
I say, no, no, I'm not going to think that way.

596
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,459
I'm not going to entertain those thoughts.

597
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,859
I'm going to think on these things.

598
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,499
I'm going to think on those things that are true and honest and pure and right and all

599
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:35,339
of that because I want to please God.

600
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:41,339
And when we sin, we refuse to cover our sin.

601
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:45,219
We find that there's great promises with regard to forgiveness.

602
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,779
If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from

603
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:50,459
all unrighteousness.

604
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:52,419
He knows about it anyway.

605
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:58,499
And so as much as we learn this evening a lesson from the life of Gehazi and we see

606
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:04,539
the historical account of that which happened in his life, I hope that we also learn from

607
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:10,099
this passage of Scripture and take some application and say, God, help me to guard my thoughts,

608
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:15,339
help me to guard my tongue, help me to speak the truth, and help me, Lord, to refuse to

609
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:20,779
cover my sin because I don't want to be in a situation such as Gehazi.

610
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:21,779
Let's pray.

611
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:22,779
Father, we love You.

612
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:23,779
We thank You for loving us.

613
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:25,139
Thank You for the blessings.

614
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:29,619
We thank You for Your Word and for the truth that's contained therein.

615
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:36,819
Lord, as we think of this passage and the truths that we can apply in our lives, I pray,

616
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:39,539
God, that You'd help us tonight.

617
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:45,699
Lord, that we would make decisions based upon that which we've learned this night.

618
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:48,979
Lord, I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

619
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:52,319
We thank You that You're a God who hears and answers prayer.

620
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:59,439
We thank You that You've worked in these last weeks in just wonderful, miraculous ways.

621
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:02,119
We thank You for many answers to prayer.

622
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,239
We just ask, God, that You would continue to work.

623
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,239
Bless our time.

624
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,839
I pray that You'd be honored and glorified, and we'll thank You for it.

625
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,879
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
