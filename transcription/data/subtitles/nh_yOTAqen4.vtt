00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
be in 2 Kings 5, 2 Kings 5, verses 20-27 will be our text this evening.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.300
Those of you that were with us last week, you'll remember that we studied the miraculous

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.479
healing of Naaman.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:21.000
Through the providence of God, Naaman was made aware of the prophet of God in Samaria.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.959
You'll remember with me that as we studied several weeks ago, the first several verses

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:32.520
of 2 Kings 5, how there was that little maid that had been taken captive into Syria, and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.119
as she was there, she spoke up and said to her mistress, would God, my Lord, were with

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:44.279
the prophet that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his leprosy.

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:50.680
This little maid was confident in her belief, and she evidently had effectively communicated

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.000
her confidence to the wife of Naaman, and then obviously to Naaman, letters were written,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.940
and eventually, we find that Naaman traveled to go right to the house of Elisha, and as

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.760
you recall from last Wednesday evening, we spoke about the way in which he stood at the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.120
door of the house of Elisha that was Naaman, and of course, as we would deal with the meeting

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.800
that occurred between Elisha and Naaman, we find that Elisha sent a messenger, and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.440
in sending a messenger, Elisha gave him some very specific, simple instruction.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.839
I mean, it was simple, it was specific, here was the instruction, go and wash in Jordan

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:40.319
seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:46.319
Nothing difficult, nothing confusing, very simple, but yet very specific as to the instruction

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.319
that was given.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.800
Eventually, at the prodding of his servants, we read that Naaman obeyed the instruction

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.279
that was given by the messenger of Elisha, and he went down to the river, and went down

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.540
to Jordan, he dipped himself seven times, and was miraculously healed.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.320
We find that he offered some gifts, and some things transpired there, and then he would

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.800
gather two mules burden of earth, and head back to Syria.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.160
And as he headed back to Syria, is where we pick up our text of Scripture this evening,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.559
in chapter number five of the book of 2 Kings, beginning in verse number 20, we find that

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:29.679
now the attention of this passage of Scripture turns to the servant of Elisha, Gehazi.

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:36.479
Notice in verse number 20, but Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, behold,

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.880
my master hath spared Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880
brought.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.080
But, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.199
So Gehazi followed after Naaman, and when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:00.240
down from the chariot to meet him, and said, is all well.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.960
And he said, this is Gehazi speaking in verse 22, all is well.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.960
My master hath sent me, saying, behold, even now there be come to me from Mount Ephraim

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.080
two young men of the sons of the prophets, give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.119
and two changes of garments.

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.520
And Naaman said, be content, take two talents.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.479
And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:34.479
and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bare them before him.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.720
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.080
house.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.580
And he let the men go, and they departed.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.520
But he went in, and stood before his master.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.240
And Elisha said unto him, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.880
And he said, thy servant went no whither.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.320
And he, Elisha, said unto him, Gehazi, went not mine heart with thee?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.720
When the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee, is it a time to receive money,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.160
and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.919
and maidservants?

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:22.359
The leprosy thereof of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed forever.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.320
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow."

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.119
Just as exciting and miraculous as our last text of Scripture was in our study of the

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:39.959
life of Elisha, when we come to this, our 25th lesson, dealing with the life and ministry

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:46.799
of Elijah and now Elisha, we find that just as exciting as our last study was and miraculous

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:53.839
that we come to this study and oh, the sadness, the unfortunate circumstances that are recorded

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:59.119
for us in this text of Scripture, and really, it didn't have to be this way.

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:04.119
But Gehazi made some decisions, and the decisions that he made were not good decisions, not

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.399
right decisions, and we find that the text of Scripture records for us the behavior of

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.600
this man Gehazi.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.920
If you're taking notes this evening, I'd give you the title, Gehazi Followed After

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920
Naaman.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.260
Gehazi Followed After Naaman.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.359
As we look at the text of Scripture, I want you to consider with me first of all this

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:27.320
evening if you're taking notes, consider his conduct.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:35.079
Really, in verses 20-25, we see that God gives us a record of the conduct of this man Gehazi.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:41.399
We find that in verse 20, the very first thing that happens is he entertains an evil

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.600
thought.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.839
We find that in verse 20, the servant of Elisha, this man Gehazi, look at what he says.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:54.880
He says, Behold, my servant hath spared Naaman the Syrian, and not receiving at his hands

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.179
that which he brought.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:01.619
You remember this is a reference back to verse 15, after the healing of Naaman, Naaman comes

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:06.220
to Elisha, and they return back to the house of Elisha, and at the end of the verse in

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.660
verse 15, it says, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.500
Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.899
But he, Elisha, said, As the Lord liveth before whom I stand, I will receive none.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.100
And he urged him to take it, but he, Elisha, refused.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.779
He, Naaman, was persistent on seeking to give a blessing, a gift, and Elisha said,

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.540
No way, I'm not taking it.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.380
But we find that Gehazi entertains this thought.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.059
He begins to entertain the idea that, Man, we missed out on an opportunity to get something.

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:51.500
Naaman was offering something, and he was persistent on his offering, and, Man, we could

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.940
have gotten some gain.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.380
We find that he entertains that evil thought, which leads to devising a deceptive plan.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.140
It's amazing to me, as we look at the text of Scripture, I mean, it's not long a period

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:13.059
of time that transpires, I mean, the Bible tells us that there, at the end of our study

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:20.059
of last week, in verses 17 through 19, that Naaman desired that two mules burden of earth,

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:24.579
you'll remember, and then he was going to depart, and it says there in verse 19, he

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:28.540
said unto him, Go in peace, so he departed from him a little way.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.619
But Gehazi, I mean, this was a very quick process of time that takes place, and in just

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:39.380
a moment of time, just a short period of time would lapse, that Gehazi devises this deceptive

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.940
plan.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.299
It's really interesting, as you consider the detail contained within the plan.

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:51.339
I mean, when you consider that Gehazi had entertained this evil thought of how he could

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:57.380
gain, get gain, and how he could go and receive something from the hand of Naaman, he's devising

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.380
this plan.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.260
He says at the end of verse number 20, but as the Lord liveth, I will run after him and

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.500
take somewhat of him.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.339
But what's he going to say to Naaman?

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:10.380
I mean, what's his plan going to be?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.779
I mean, Naaman had already offered to Elisha to give him a blessing, and Elisha refused.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:24.220
And though Naaman urged him in persistence, we find that Elisha refused.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:30.420
So Gehazi, he devises this deceptive plan, and he runs after Naaman.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.559
The Bible tells us in verse number 21 that he followed after Naaman, notice, and when

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:39.979
Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said,

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.820
is all well.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.500
We find that in verse number 21, again, in your mind's eye, if you can see it, they first

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.419
arrived there, that group of people, according to verse number nine, that traveled with Naaman,

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:54.820
they arrived at the house of Elisha.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.780
And we find that Elisha departed, excuse me, Naaman departed from the house of Elisha and

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:05.299
eventually went down there to the Jordan to dip seven times in Jordan.

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:09.820
And then he returns back to Elisha's house, and that's where the interaction is recorded

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:12.020
in verses 15 through 19.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.940
And now Naaman has departed and Naaman is leaving with that host of people that came

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.460
from Syria, and here's Gehazi chasing him.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.900
Gehazi's running after him.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:30.179
We find that Naaman recognizes, he sees, he notices that there's someone pursuing.

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:36.059
And so Naaman gives the command for the chariot to stop, and he comes down from the chariot

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:39.380
and he says, is all well.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.020
This is what Gehazi says, all is well, all is well.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:53.900
And then I want you to see how quickly he begins to devise or to put in play, to put

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:59.380
in motion this plan, this wicked, deceptive plan that he devised.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.380
He says,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.920
Number one, my Master hath sent me.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.380
Did Elisha send Naaman?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.580
No.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.140
I believe that Gehazi understood

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.780
that if he said to Naaman that Elisha sent me,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.060
that he'd probably get what he wanted.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.060
So he says to Naaman,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.760
he says,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.160
Elisha sent me.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.120
My Master hath sent me.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.320
Verse 22, and then notice, saying,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.740
Behold, even now there be come to me

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.380
from Mount Ephraim two young men

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.860
of the sons of the prophets.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.180
Wow.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.480
Further down the path of lying, right?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.240
Elisha had not commanded Gehazi to go.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.400
Two men from Ephraim from the schools of the prophets

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.900
or the sons of the prophets,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.560
they did not come in need of these things.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.120
But we find that Gehazi has devised this plan.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.120
Isn't it amazing

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.460
when you think about the nature of human beings?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.840
I mean, just the wickedness,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.160
the depravity of our hearts.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.580
The Bible talks about the fact

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.900
that our hearts are deceitful

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.040
and desperately wicked.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.140
Who can know it?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.640
And we find here that this man Gehazi

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.880
very quickly, I mean, on the run so to speak,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.480
he's just making this stuff up.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.440
He's just totally lying about what was taking place.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.880
And he speaks to Naaman.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.180
And then he says, okay, so here's the deal, Naaman.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.500
My Master sent me.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.700
Elisha sent me.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.660
There's two men, two young men

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.220
that are from the sons of the prophets

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.180
that have come.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.340
And here's what we need.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.580
Give them, I pray thee,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.300
a talent of silver

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.700
and two changes of garments.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.020
So, Gehazi was present

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.740
when Naaman had offered a blessing to Elisha.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.580
And we find that he now comes

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.560
and he says, here's what we need.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.160
We need a talent of silver

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.820
and two changes of garments.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.560
Notice what Naaman says.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.240
I mean, Naaman's very willing to give.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.880
He says, be content.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.480
Take two talents.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.120
You only asked for one, take two.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.480
He says this,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.520
and he urged him,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.000
and bound two talents of silver

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.220
and two bags with two changes of garments.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.059
Notice this,

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.180
and laid them upon two of his servants

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.900
and they bared them before him.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.020
Gehazi didn't even carry the stuff back.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.700
The two servants of Naaman

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.460
are the ones that bring it back to the tower

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.940
that is mentioned in verse number 24.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.260
And so we find that now Gehazi receives the goods.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.940
He had devised this deceptive plan.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.340
He shows up, he goes running after the chariot of Naaman

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.300
and Naaman sees that Gehazi is coming.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.000
He stops, he says, it's all well.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.279
And he says, all is well.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.740
My master has sent me

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.480
and there's these two young men

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.279
that have come from the sons of the prophets

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.160
and they need some money and some clothes.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.600
And Naaman says, be content.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.400
Here, have two talents of silver.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.000
Here are two changes of garments.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.919
And we find that they're carried there.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:12.800
He says that he laid them upon two of his servants

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.919
and they bared them before him.

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:15.440
Notice verse 24.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.680
And when he came to the tower,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.360
he took them from their hand.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.279
Does that ever make of interest to you?

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:25.139
If this thing were, of course, true,

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:26.660
Gehazi wouldn't have minded

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.620
if they brought it all the way back to the house, would he?

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.260
What's he trying to do?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.900
He's trying to cover up for himself, right?

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.300
He understands what he's doing.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.139
He knows that this thing is a lie.

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.660
He knows that Elisha had not sent him.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.139
And the Bible says that he took them from their hand.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:46.180
Notice this in verse 24,

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.700
and bestowed them in the house.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.760
And he let the men go and they departed.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.160
And so he brings them into the house.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.200
I'm not sure, as he leaves the goods in the house,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.800
I'm not sure where he put them in the house.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.360
I'm not sure if it's a situation

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.840
such as you read of Achan there in the book of Joshua,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.000
where he hid them in his tent,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.600
that which he was not allowed to take.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.639
And we find here that he brings them,

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.139
he bestows them in the house.

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:15.680
But I want you to notice what happens in verse number 25

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.640
as we continue to consider the conduct of this man, Naaman.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.420
It says, but he went in and stood before his master.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.119
Can you imagine?

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:32.080
He just did all of this that is recorded for us.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.920
Lied.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.160
Took that which he wasn't really supposed to take.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.600
Received it through the lie that he gave.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.080
And the man Naaman believed something that was not true.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.760
And we find that then he goes

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.839
and he stands before Elisha,

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:54.959
seemingly without even a guilty conscience

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.600
of what he just did.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.679
We consider his conduct.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.080
I want you to consider the consequences.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.720
The Bible says in verse number 25

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.320
that Elijah said unto him,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.320
Whence comest thou, Gehazi?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.600
That's kind of interesting, is it not?

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:21.119
Elisha says to Gehazi,

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:23.480
where have you been?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.800
Whence comest thou?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.399
And notice, Gehazi has to lie again, right?

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.959
I mean, he can't tell him the truth.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.520
He can't tell him what he just did.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.119
He can't tell him I've been running after Naaman

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:35.800
so that I could receive some goods.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.880
No, he says, thy servant went no whither.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.080
I didn't go anywhere.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.920
He lies.

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.720
This thing spirals out of control.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.080
We find that many have used the analogy

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.600
in years gone by about a web of lies

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.320
and that whole scenario

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.160
that people have painted that picture.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.119
I think it's very appropriate and applicable.

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:00.800
But you find here that Gehazi

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.440
got himself into a position

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.720
where there was a probing question.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.239
Whence comest thou, Gehazi?

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:09.959
And he could not say where he came from,

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:11.480
so he has to continue to lie.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.760
And he says I didn't go anywhere.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.200
My servant went no whither.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.480
Notice, however, that Elisha says to him

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.119
in verse 26,

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:24.000
went not mine heart with thee?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.880
When the man turned again from his chariot

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.760
to meet thee?

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.119
Now, I want you to put yourself

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:33.160
in the position of Gehazi at this moment.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.000
You've got to loosen your collar, right?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.320
I mean, it's getting hot.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.119
It's like, how does he know?

00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:40.959
The thing that I can't quite understand

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.800
is Gehazi was the servant of Elisha

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.760
and he knew he'd experienced

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.800
how God had given Elisha

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.880
so many insights

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.559
and even in the situation

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.320
that we just read about with Naaman

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.640
and all that took place,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.959
and you see how God was using Elisha,

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:02.239
and yet, Gehazi somehow thought

00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:06.520
that he could get by with this thing.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.080
And notice that Elisha continues

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.720
the series of questions.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:17.640
He says, is it a time to receive money?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.119
And to receive garments?

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.040
Can you imagine?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.279
I mean, those are the two things

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:23.559
he just received, right?

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:26.360
He told Naaman, there's these two guys

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.239
that came, these two young men,

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:30.520
and we need a talon of silver

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.360
and two changes of garments.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.920
And here, Elisha says, is it time?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.640
Is it a time to receive money

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.480
and to receive garments and oliveyards

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.880
and vineyards and sheep and oxen

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.080
and menservants and maidservants?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.520
We read in verse 27 a sad conclusion.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.239
The Bible says,

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:59.040
the leprosy therefore of Naaman

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.399
shall cleave unto thee

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:06.880
and unto thy seed forever.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.920
And when he went out from the presence,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.080
or in his presence,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.800
a leper as white as snow.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.320
Wow.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.040
That's sad.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.279
You read this particular account

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:20.720
and you read what happened,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.920
and you see the consequences

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.839
it's given to us in verse 27,

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.679
and you understand as you study

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:27.839
the passage of Scripture

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:29.520
why that happened.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.679
If you were to just read verse 27

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:34.000
and see that this man Gehazi

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.799
left the presence of Elisha

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:37.679
being a leper as white as snow,

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:38.880
you'd say what happened?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.840
What is going on?

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.840
Why did this transpire?

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.000
You go back and you begin reading

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440
in verses 20-25

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.559
and you see the behavior,

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.359
the conduct of Gehazi,

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:50.200
and you see the consequence,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.559
the punishment, the judgment

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.000
that is there upon Gehazi.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.359
As we look at a passage of Scripture

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.880
like this, I believe there's some lessons

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.799
for us to learn.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:01.080
I believe, in fact,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.679
that there are some valuable lessons

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:04.080
for us to learn.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.320
Obviously, we could close the Scriptures

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.200
and say, don't do as Gehazi did.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.200
That would be good counsel, amen?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.599
But let me just give you three thoughts

00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.599
this evening as we conclude

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:16.400
and just give you three lessons

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.039
I believe that would be applicable

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:19.280
for each of us today.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.479
Number one, guard your thoughts.

00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:24.200
Guard your thoughts.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.599
See, it all started with an evil thought,

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.799
did it not?

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.640
He entertained this thought,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.400
hey, you know what?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.160
I can go get something.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.000
And he had this thought.

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:37.599
Someone said this,

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:40.919
thoughts lead to actions.

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:43.359
Thoughts lead to actions.

00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:46.679
Gehazi thought, Naaman's leaving.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:47.880
We could have gotten some money.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.960
We could have gotten some whatever.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.799
I don't want him to leave

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:55.000
without getting something,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.280
so he devises this plan.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.320
It started with a thought.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.599
Thoughts lead to actions.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:19:59.599
Notice in the New Testament

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:00.599
as we consider this,

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:04.159
truth of guarding your thoughts, turn to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will, we'll

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:13.399
look at two passages of Scripture here in the New Testament with regard to our thoughts.

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:17.139
Our thoughts are important.

00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:22.459
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10 and verse number 3, for though we walk in the flesh,

00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:24.779
we do not war after the flesh.

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:28.659
Verse 4, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:30.419
down of strongholds.

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:35.859
Notice verse number 5 of 2 Corinthians 10, casting down imaginations and every high

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:44.059
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:47.779
to the obedience of Christ.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:53.979
See the reality this evening as we would consider some lessons from this passage in 2 Kings

00:20:53.979 --> 00:20:57.099
chapter 5 is that we need to guard our thoughts.

00:20:57.099 --> 00:21:04.099
See this evening, there's nothing maybe that we could deal with in life as we look at this

00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:09.379
circumstance of Gehazi and Naaman and there might not be anything specific in that particular

00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:13.459
regard that we would face, but we find that as we go through life that there are times

00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:16.459
that thoughts enter our minds.

00:21:16.459 --> 00:21:21.979
It's important that we guard, that we do as it says at the end of verse number 5 and bringing

00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:28.419
into captivity every thought, notice, to the obedience of Christ.

00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:33.539
If you have a thought that's going to lead to an action that's going to require deception,

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:36.059
it's definitely not in the obedience of Christ.

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:37.059
Amen?

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:42.659
And so we find that there's this truth that we have as New Testament believers in understanding

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:48.459
the importance of bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ over

00:21:48.459 --> 00:21:53.699
in the book of Philippians in chapter number 4, verse number 8, it's a familiar verse of

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:59.819
Scripture that speaks about those things that we are to think on.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:04.539
In Philippians 4 and verse number 8, finally my brethren, what sort of things are true?

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:06.219
What sort of things are honest?

00:22:06.219 --> 00:22:07.419
What sort of things are just?

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:08.819
What sort of things are pure?

00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:10.139
What sort of things are lovely?

00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:12.099
What sort of things are of good report?

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:19.219
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things.

00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:21.539
The very first thing, what sort of things are true?

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.939
Gehazi had to make up all these lies, right?

00:22:24.939 --> 00:22:28.739
He started out by saying, my master sendeth me.

00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:30.619
No, he didn't.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:32.419
Elisha never told you to go anywhere.

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:39.299
And so we find that there's a lesson, a valuable application for us this evening as we study

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:43.979
2 Kings chapter number 5, number 1, that we guard our thoughts, number 2, that we guard

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:45.219
our tongue.

00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:51.219
See, his thoughts led to actions, but then his tongue got him in all kinds of trouble.

00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:56.219
He ran after the chariot, and once he did, he begins lying.

00:22:56.219 --> 00:23:00.339
And that lying spiraled out of control to the point where he lied about why he was there

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:06.339
all is well, he lied about how, why he came, what he needed, he lied to Elisha when he

00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:08.539
got back to the house of Elisha.

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:16.099
He goes and stands before him, and we find that Elisha says, hey, where have you been?

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:17.099
I've not gone anywhere.

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:23.219
So we've got to be careful, not only of our thoughts, but of our speech.

00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:25.739
Ephesians chapter number 4, we're right here in the book of Philippians, turn to the book

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:31.499
of Ephesians, if you will, and notice two verses of Scripture here in Ephesians chapter

00:23:31.499 --> 00:23:38.219
number 4, and we studied the book of Ephesians in 2019 and looked at this passage pretty

00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:42.539
extensively during the latter part of our study through the book of Ephesians.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:48.459
But notice in verse 15, but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him, into him in

00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:51.019
all things, which is the head, even Christ.

00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:56.839
Skip down to verse number 29, if you will, it says, let no corrupt communication proceed

00:23:56.839 --> 00:24:00.719
out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.479
grace unto the hearers.

00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:09.479
David said this in Psalm 19 and verse number 14, let the words of my mouth and the meditation

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:16.279
of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:23.759
See Gehazi, he didn't guard his thoughts, and then he didn't guard his tongue.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:30.679
As he went through with this plan that he devised, as that plan was set in motion, and

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:35.399
we find that he runs after, I mean, he's all in on this plan.

00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:40.759
And somehow he thinks that he's going to be able to take those goods and hide them in

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:44.479
the house, he bestowed them in the house, and that he could go into the presence of

00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:47.679
Elisha and just basically no one would ever know.

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:52.519
But see, the reality is that God knows.

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:55.079
God knows.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:25:00.839
The fact of the matter is that here in this passage of Scripture, we read of a historical

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:05.799
account of that which happened in the life of Gehazi, but as we learn that lesson from

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:11.679
the life of Gehazi, we apply valuable lessons to us, takeaways, if you will, what can I

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:12.679
learn from this?

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:15.759
Listen, I don't want to deal with the judgment of God.

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:19.999
I don't want to be in that position where I have to experience the chastening hand of

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:20.999
the Lord.

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:26.239
So we find that we're to guard our thoughts, guard our tongue, our speech, if you will.

00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:31.479
And then let me say this, refuse to cover your sin.

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:33.359
Refuse to cover your sin.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:39.359
See, Gehazi knew that he couldn't bring that which he received from the hand of Naaman

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:42.799
back into the presence of Elisha.

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:43.959
That would have been a bad deal.

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:48.479
He knew that he couldn't do that, so he takes them when they get to that tower that's mentioned

00:25:48.639 --> 00:25:52.839
in verse 24, he takes them from those two servants, he goes in, and he bestows them

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:53.839
in the house.

00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:59.199
Again, I'm not 100% sure what he does with them, but he let the men go and they departed.

00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:04.159
And see, he goes in, the Bible says, and stood before his master, according to verse number

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:06.519
25.

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:15.479
And then even as Elisha begins to ask this probing question, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:21.279
He still covers, he's trying to cover up that which he's done.

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:27.919
He does not respond with a broken response, a repentant heart, no.

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:30.839
He says, thy servant went no whither.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:34.639
He continues to lie, to try to cover his sin.

00:26:34.639 --> 00:26:36.279
But see, we need to refuse to cover our sin.

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:42.079
I'm mindful of various passages of Scripture in which we find that there are people that

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:44.599
seek to cover their sin.

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:49.159
But the reality is that we need to come to that place in our lives where we say, I am

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:51.599
not going to cover my sin.

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:57.559
When there's a question that's asked, a probing question if you will, that I would allow myself

00:26:57.559 --> 00:27:03.239
to be sensitive to the convicting work of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:27:03.239 --> 00:27:08.959
That we would not cause ourselves to be in that position where we have quenched the Spirit

00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:10.719
or grieved the Spirit.

00:27:10.719 --> 00:27:18.159
That we would not have a seared conscience, but that we would be very responsive to the

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:22.039
conviction of the Holy Spirit of God in our lives.

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:29.199
See I believe that when Elisha asks that question how he does, whence comest thou, Gehazi?

00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:34.359
There's an opportunity for just a moment of time for Gehazi to get right.

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:39.759
I'm not sure exactly how it would have changed the entire outcome of the scenario here, but

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:44.679
the reality is that there was a moment of time in order for him to just get right.

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:46.639
You know what?

00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:49.079
I went and chased after Naaman.

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:52.119
And I lied to him and I told him that you sent me.

00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:57.319
I mean I could just imagine the countenance of Elisha as he's hearing this from Gehazi

00:27:57.319 --> 00:28:02.039
and Gehazi says, and I told him that there were two young men from the sons of the prophets

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:06.679
that came and they need some money and they need some garments and he gave me two talents

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:08.879
of silver and two changes of garments.

00:28:08.879 --> 00:28:15.719
But no, he said, I didn't go anywhere, so he refused to cover our sin.

00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:20.039
We find that it seems obvious through the passage of Scripture, not only through the

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:25.679
behavior leading up to his interaction there with Elisha, but even at the interaction with

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:29.919
Elisha that he has seared his conscience.

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:31.439
He just continued to try to cover it up.

00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:36.159
You know, the Bible says this in Psalm 32 and verse number 1.

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:42.679
What a wonderful verse of Scripture with regard to the blessing of being forgiven.

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:52.440
The Bible says, blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.519
You know, it's a blessing to be forgiven by God.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:59.479
To know that we've been forgiven.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:01.719
See, we're not trying to cover up our sin.

00:29:01.719 --> 00:29:05.979
We're not trying to have this web of lies of who we tell and what we do.

00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:11.199
And even so, when he has the silver and the garments there in his house, how's he going

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:12.199
to bring it out?

00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:13.199
When's he going to bring it out?

00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:14.839
How's he ever going to use it?

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:18.599
Is there going to be a question down the line, where did you get that?

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:23.279
See, to be forgiven is a blessing.

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:26.799
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:32.399
See, the psalmist understood that truth and then says this, and really it goes hand in

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:35.919
hand in verse number 5, I acknowledged my sin unto thee.

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:42.039
I looked at this just a few weeks ago on Sunday evening with Jeremiah with the importance

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:43.919
of acknowledging thine iniquity.

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:47.799
Verse 5, I acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:51.599
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:54.799
of my sin, Selah.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:30:00.159
And then we find there in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13 that the Bible gives us a

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:00.599
very...

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:08.319
direct truth with regard to covering our sin and those that confess and forsake.

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:15.139
The Bible says in Proverbs 28 and verse 13, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper,

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:20.439
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:32.839
See, the Bible contains historical data, records of God's interaction with mankind, with individuals,

00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:37.839
with the nation of Israel, other nations and kingdoms, and so on and so forth, but as we

00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:42.559
begin to study those particular accounts, not only do we have the opportunity to learn

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:49.159
history and to learn what happened here with Naaman and Gehazi and Elisha, and to see specifically

00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:53.639
as the text of Scripture draws its attention to Gehazi and his actions in this text of

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:58.959
Scripture, but we find that the Bible gives us these records so that we can learn lessons

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:04.159
in our lives, so that we can take application and say, you know what, I see what happened

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:07.919
to Gehazi, and how could we prevent that from happening?

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.599
I don't want the judgment.

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:16.259
I think if you asked Gehazi in verse number 15, when all of that interaction was taking

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:21.619
place where Naaman is offering a blessing, if you looked at Gehazi and said, hey listen,

00:31:21.619 --> 00:31:28.239
if you want something, you can get it, but you're going to get leprosy too.

00:31:28.239 --> 00:31:32.159
Go ahead and take a blessing from Naaman, but with it comes leprosy.

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:34.939
What do you think Gehazi would have said?

00:31:34.939 --> 00:31:36.059
No way.

00:31:36.059 --> 00:31:39.359
I'm not interested, right?

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:44.019
But the problem is that we don't always know what the consequence is going to be.

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:47.899
We know, be not deceived, God is not mocked, whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:48.899
reap.

00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:50.379
We know that principle in God's Word.

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:55.979
But here's the amazing thing as New Testament believers, but I say even for Gehazi, he had

00:31:55.979 --> 00:31:59.619
the record of the Garden of Eden, right?

00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:01.059
Adam and Eve tried to hide their sin.

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:02.739
They tried to cover it up.

00:32:02.739 --> 00:32:04.659
God knew what was going on.

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:05.659
Where art thou?

00:32:05.659 --> 00:32:11.379
That was a probing, convicting question, was it not?

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:14.379
We hid ourselves because we were naked.

00:32:14.379 --> 00:32:16.179
Who told you that you were naked, right?

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:18.619
Isn't that what God says in Genesis 3, right?

00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:21.559
You know.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:24.579
We have that record.

00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:31.459
Gehazi could have known certainly about the situation there with Achan.

00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:37.539
In fact, the writer of the book of 1 Chronicles names Achan as the troubler of Israel.

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:40.619
Isn't that a wonderful way to be remembered?

00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:44.099
The troubler of Israel, Achan.

00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:45.099
What did he do?

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:46.099
Well, he saw it.

00:32:46.099 --> 00:32:47.099
He desired it.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:48.099
He took it.

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.099
He hid it.

00:32:49.099 --> 00:32:51.299
And eventually he was stoned, right?

00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:56.019
Joshua 7, terrible.

00:32:56.019 --> 00:33:00.239
He could have known about the circumstance, the situation with David.

00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:01.239
He sees Bathsheba.

00:33:01.239 --> 00:33:02.239
Who is she?

00:33:02.239 --> 00:33:03.239
Bring her to me.

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:04.739
I want her.

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:11.299
And then in just a little while, the prophet of God stands before David, Nathan, and says,

00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:14.539
David, thou art the man.

00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:18.659
See, God's given us plenty of examples in His Word.

00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:21.579
Ananias and Sapphira, you want a New Testament example?

00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:22.579
Acts 5.

00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:26.099
Hey, listen, we're going to sell our property and we're going to tell them we sold it for

00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:30.019
this much so we can give it all to God and we're going to really look good.

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:32.899
They devised their plan.

00:33:32.899 --> 00:33:36.459
God never told them they had to sell their land, by the way.

00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:39.379
God never told them that if they sold their land, they had to give all the money to the

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:42.099
church.

00:33:42.099 --> 00:33:44.739
But they came and they said, here's what we did.

00:33:44.739 --> 00:33:46.379
What happened?

00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:50.419
They died an untimely death from our human perspective.

00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:52.219
God judged.

00:33:52.219 --> 00:33:53.219
What happened?

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:56.139
The Bible says that fear fell upon them.

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:58.019
You'd be fearful too.

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:01.299
See, God's given us many examples.

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:05.859
And I tell you, often it just starts with a thought, an evil thought, a wrong thought.

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:08.219
But thoughts lead to actions.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:14.139
It's so important that we guard our thoughts, that we bring them into captivity to the obedience

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:19.659
of Christ, that we think on these things that are mentioned in Philippians 4.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:20.739
Because why?

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.739
Because it starts with a thought.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.099
I say, no, no, I'm not going to think that way.

00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:26.459
I'm not going to entertain those thoughts.

00:34:26.459 --> 00:34:28.859
I'm going to think on these things.

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:31.499
I'm going to think on those things that are true and honest and pure and right and all

00:34:31.499 --> 00:34:35.339
of that because I want to please God.

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:41.339
And when we sin, we refuse to cover our sin.

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:45.219
We find that there's great promises with regard to forgiveness.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.779
If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from

00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:50.459
all unrighteousness.

00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:52.419
He knows about it anyway.

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:58.499
And so as much as we learn this evening a lesson from the life of Gehazi and we see

00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:04.539
the historical account of that which happened in his life, I hope that we also learn from

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:10.099
this passage of Scripture and take some application and say, God, help me to guard my thoughts,

00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:15.339
help me to guard my tongue, help me to speak the truth, and help me, Lord, to refuse to

00:35:15.339 --> 00:35:20.779
cover my sin because I don't want to be in a situation such as Gehazi.

00:35:20.779 --> 00:35:21.779
Let's pray.

00:35:21.779 --> 00:35:22.779
Father, we love You.

00:35:22.779 --> 00:35:23.779
We thank You for loving us.

00:35:23.779 --> 00:35:25.139
Thank You for the blessings.

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:29.619
We thank You for Your Word and for the truth that's contained therein.

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:36.819
Lord, as we think of this passage and the truths that we can apply in our lives, I pray,

00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:39.539
God, that You'd help us tonight.

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:45.699
Lord, that we would make decisions based upon that which we've learned this night.

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:48.979
Lord, I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:35:48.979 --> 00:35:52.319
We thank You that You're a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:59.439
We thank You that You've worked in these last weeks in just wonderful, miraculous ways.

00:35:59.439 --> 00:36:02.119
We thank You for many answers to prayer.

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:04.239
We just ask, God, that You would continue to work.

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:05.239
Bless our time.

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:07.839
I pray that You'd be honored and glorified, and we'll thank You for it.

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.879
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
