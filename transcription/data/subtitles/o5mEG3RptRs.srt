1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
powerful passage of Scripture that really reveals to us not only the faith

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,119
and obedience of Abraham, but it's one of the the mountain peaks of Scripture, if

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,040
you will. Obviously within the context we look at Mount Moriah being here and look

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,200
at all that has taken place, but when you think about the mountain peaks of

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,360
Scripture, aside from Mount Calvary, this is probably the highest point,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,120
spiritually speaking, of all of the Scripture, what takes place here at Mount

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,040
Moriah. As we look at the passage of Scripture and as we are mindful of the,

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,319
you know, historical account that takes place and obviously have the ability to

9
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:45,599
learn very important life lessons, we also are mindful of the fact that this

10
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:51,919
passage of Scripture provides us with a beautiful type of the Lord Jesus Christ

11
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:57,400
in his substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary for the sin of mankind.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,000
And I'm so thankful for the picture that is provided in this passage of Scripture.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,519
Before we get to that particular picture, let's look at the passage and

14
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,480
deal with the content here historically. If you are taking notes, we're going to

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,400
dig right into it this evening. Number one, I want you to notice the test for

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,000
Abraham. Verses one and two provide us with the test for Abraham. The Bible says

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,800
this, and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,760
said unto him, Abraham, and he said, behold, here I am. And he, God, said, take now thy

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,279
son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of

20
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:41,959
Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains,

21
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,480
which I will tell thee of. Now, as you look at this passage of Scripture and begin to

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,680
notice the test for Abraham, we understand that it begins by saying, and

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,279
it came to pass after these things. We are not sure as to how much time has

24
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:02,800
passed between the events of chapter 20 and 21. Specifically, as you look at

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,879
chapter number 21 and all that has taken place, obviously the birth of Isaac, the

26
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,800
weaning of Isaac, and then of course the casting out of Ishmael and Hagar and all

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
that takes place with Abimelech, excuse me, yes, as we look at Abimelech at the

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,720
end of the passage. And so you look at all of these things, but God tells us

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,520
that it came to pass after these things. Bible scholars typically agree on the

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,479
fact that Isaac at this point was at least a teenager. We don't know the exact

31
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,839
age of Isaac, but it's agreeable, it's common that we would believe that he was

32
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:42,559
a teenager. In fact, if you look at verse number five, the Bible says here, and

33
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:48,240
Abraham said unto his young men, abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,399
will go yonder and worship and come again to you. And so he speaks to the

35
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:59,199
young men and assigns them to stay with the livestock, but then he says this, I

36
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:06,080
and the lad, speaking of Isaac, the Hebrew word for young men and lad are the same

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,360
exact Hebrew word. And so it would be obvious that Isaac is not just a

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,119
five- or six-year-old little kid at this particular time. It seems that he at

39
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:21,119
least would be a teenager, maybe even as old as being 20 years old. We give you

40
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,240
that content to kind of understand what's going on here with the

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,160
timeline, but I want you to notice in verse number one that it says that God

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,960
did tempt Abraham. Now that word tempt, it's important that we understand that

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,199
that word means to test, to try, or to prove. We know that God does not tempt

44
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,679
men with evil, with sin. We understand that biblically. James is very clear on

45
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:52,240
that. In fact, as you look at Hebrews 11, the Bible, speaking of this particular

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,360
event of Genesis 22, says of Abraham when he was tried. And the word, it's a

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,759
proper interpretation of the word, and it's understood that it means to test or

48
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:09,240
to prove or to try. And so we find that, as I've mentioned, the test for Abraham

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
is given here in this passage of Scripture. You see that the Bible says

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,720
that God did tempt Abraham, and notice it says that he called unto him, he said

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,600
Abraham, and Abraham responded, here I am. And here comes the test, here comes the

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,079
assignment. Notice the instruction that is provided in verse number two. God says

53
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:37,320
to Abraham, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac. Notice these words, whom thou

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,519
lovest. Now, Isaac was born in chapter number 21. We looked at that several

55
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,480
weeks ago, and as we look at the birth of Isaac, we made this statement that

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,239
Abraham had believed God and had waited on God for 25 years from the first

57
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:59,040
giving of the promise that Abraham would have a seed, and we find that that

58
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
promise is fulfilled just as God said it would be fulfilled in chapter 21. And now,

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,559
God says, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest. Okay? We're

60
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:15,200
clear, we understand, this is okay at this point. He says this, and get thee into

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,119
the land of Moriah. Okay? I understand I'm supposed to get my son, I understand I'm

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,480
supposed to go to the land of Moriah. And then he says this, and offer him there

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,399
for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. That

64
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,239
gets real tough, doesn't it? Gets real tough. And as we look at the passage of

65
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:44,040
Scripture, I find oftentimes in our lives, that as we look to the Word of God, that

66
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,320
there are times in which we question things that are recorded in the Word of

67
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:54,640
God, when the actual characters that were involved never questioned God. Does

68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,440
there strike you in that fashion, where we question, well, why did God tell

69
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,239
Abraham to do this, and why this, and why that, and so on and so forth? Abraham

70
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:10,079
doesn't ask God why. Abraham receives the instruction, very detailed, very specific

71
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,920
instruction. He tells him what he is to do, where he is to go, and what is to take

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,200
place there. And he tells him that he's to offer there his son Isaac, his only

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,279
son, the one that he loves, the one that had been promised, the one that he waited

74
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,559
on, that he's to offer him as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which

75
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:38,799
I will tell thee of. Now think about that. That's a challenge. I'm not sure this

76
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:45,519
evening, if we were faced with a test of this magnitude, if I were to be honest

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,519
with you this evening, if you were to be honest with me, if we're to be honest

78
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,119
with one another and honest before God, I'm not sure how well we would do. Is

79
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:59,600
that a fair statement? I'm being very transparent with you tonight. I'm not

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,480
sure how well we would do. There are times in which God asks us to give up

81
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,000
far less than what he's speaking to Abraham about tonight, and we resist it.

82
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,359
Right? We resist it. Why do I have to do that? Why do I have to do this? Why that?

83
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:21,920
And we resist it. And as we look at this passage of Scripture, and we look at this

84
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,160
test, and we we notice the magnitude of what's happening, now understand as we go

85
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,279
through the passage tonight, we're gonna understand the picture, the type that is

86
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,320
provided for us, but Abraham's a man like me and you. He's made of the same flesh.

87
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:46,040
He waited for this son, Isaac, and God had repeatedly told Abraham that he was

88
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,440
going to have descendants, and he said that those descendants were gonna be

89
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,119
like the stars of the heavens and like the sand of the seas, right? I mean, that's

90
00:07:55,119 --> 00:08:00,760
the imagery, the truth that God gives to Abraham, and now Abraham, before

91
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,640
Isaac is married, before Isaac has any children, Abraham is being told by God to

92
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,119
take this son, your only son, the one that you love, and offer him as a burnt

93
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:17,399
offering upon one of the mountains that I will tell thee of. We notice the test

94
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,079
for Abraham. The next, really almost the entirety of the passage, we'll make some

95
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,119
comments about verses 20 through 24, but in verses 3 through 19, I notice the

96
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:34,159
testimony of Abraham. The testimony of Abraham. Someone said this, there's no

97
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,919
testimony without a test. Obviously, it's a play on words because you need T-E-S-T

98
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,799
in order to start the word testimony, and so you have no testimony without a test.

99
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,119
And here, when we read the testimony of Abraham, and we'll go verse by verse

100
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:55,679
through this and dissect it and understand what's taking place, but I

101
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,320
would summarize the testimony of Abraham in two ways. One, that we've used by way

102
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,599
of our title this evening, his faith and his obedience. But I also would offer

103
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:12,679
this summary of the testimony of Abraham in this passage of Scripture. It's one of

104
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,239
surrender and sacrifice. I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

105
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,280
there are a few other portions of Scripture that you can go to in all of

106
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,719
the Word of God to see a level of surrender that we see here in Genesis 22.

107
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,479
We find that often as we speak about the importance of surrender, and Murray wrote

108
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:37,559
a book many years ago on this subject, Andrew Murray, on absolute surrender, and

109
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,719
I've often, as I've read that book, I've actually read it several times, and we

110
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:45,520
think about the truth of absolute surrender, and we think about Paul as he

111
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,599
would say, I am crucified with Christ in Galatians 2.20. We think of the

112
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,840
admonition in Romans 12 that were to present our bodies a living sacrifice,

113
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,880
wholly acceptable unto God, and he says this, which is your reasonable service.

114
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,600
and we think about this thought of absolute surrender,

115
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,640
and in here in this passage of Scripture,

116
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,360
not only do we see the faith and obedience of Abraham,

117
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,860
but we see the surrender and sacrifice.

118
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,400
And I wonder tonight, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

119
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,440
I wonder tonight, is there something in my life,

120
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,780
is there something in your life

121
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,000
that we're holding on to so tight

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,540
that we'd not be willing to give up for God?

123
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,320
I don't know what that something is.

124
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't know in our lives,

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
but I just wonder if we look at a passage like this,

126
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
and we see the faith and obedience,

127
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,160
and we see the surrender and the sacrifice,

128
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,700
I wonder in 2021, what is it that I'm holding on to?

129
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,980
What is it that I'm unwilling to surrender to God

130
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,780
that I'm not trusting or believing God for?

131
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Because this test right here

132
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,620
is a test that none of us

133
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,660
are gonna actually ever have to face.

134
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,340
God's never gonna ask you to sacrifice your son or daughter.

135
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,320
He's not going to.

136
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,300
So anything that we would give up is far less

137
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,420
than what Abraham is assigned to do.

138
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,260
Would you agree?

139
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,140
And here, as we look at the testimony of Abraham,

140
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,180
notice in verse number three, the Bible says,

141
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,180
and Abraham rose up early in the morning

142
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,560
and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him

143
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
and Isaac, his son,

144
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
and claimed the wood for the burnt offering

145
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,520
and rose up and went into the place

146
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,060
of which God had told him.

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,280
If you just let verse number three

148
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
sink into your mind this evening,

149
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,680
into your heart this evening,

150
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,400
you see the immediate response of Abraham

151
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,120
of being obedience.

152
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,960
I mean, absolute obedience.

153
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,820
No questioning, no delay.

154
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,500
The Bible says that he rose up early in the morning.

155
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,080
If there was ever a day to sleep in,

156
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,940
perhaps it would have been that day.

157
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,700
You understand what I'm saying?

158
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,220
If there was ever a day to have some delay

159
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,180
in what you're doing,

160
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,279
has there ever been a task that you've had to do

161
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,840
that you say, I just really am pushing it off

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,240
as long as I possibly can

163
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
because I really don't wanna do that thing.

164
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,779
I know I have to do it,

165
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,400
but I really don't wanna get around to doing it.

166
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,700
The Bible tells us when Abraham receives this instruction

167
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,120
from God that he rose up early in the morning.

168
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,100
Immediate obedience.

169
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,139
It's absolutely convicting to me

170
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,900
when I read this passage of Scripture.

171
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,040
To see the character of Abraham,

172
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,960
to see the faith and the obedience of Abraham.

173
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,680
It says that he went to the place

174
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,639
of which God had told him.

175
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,200
Notice in verse number four,

176
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,460
then on the third day,

177
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,220
Abraham lifted up his eyes

178
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,779
and saw the place afar off.

179
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,820
God told Abraham that he was going to tell him

180
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,960
at the end of verse number two

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,980
on one of the mountains,

182
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,540
which I will tell thee of.

183
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,059
And so God had made it clear that this is the place.

184
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,279
It's interesting that it says on the third day.

185
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,059
And we as Bible believers,

186
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,740
as New Testament believers,

187
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,779
we understand the significance

188
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,080
of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior

189
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,340
on the third day.

190
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,860
And what a blessing that is.

191
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,080
But we notice here that the Bible says

192
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,800
that Abraham lifted up his eyes

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,279
and he saw the place afar off.

194
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,559
And Abraham said unto his young men,

195
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,240
abide ye here with the ass

196
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,580
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship.

197
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,559
And what does it say at the end of verse number five?

198
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,680
And come again to you.

199
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
You saw his obedience in verse number three

200
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
when he immediately early rose up

201
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,620
and took and followed the direction

202
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,760
that God had given.

203
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,240
And now in verse number five,

204
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,620
we note his faith where the Bible says

205
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,000
that I and the lad will go yonder and worship.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,779
And he says, and come again to you.

207
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,960
But what did God tell Abraham to do up at this mountain?

208
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
To sacrifice his son.

209
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,139
Is that not what God said in verse number two?

210
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,660
Offer him therefore a burnt offering

211
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,779
upon one of the mountains,

212
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,120
which I will tell thee of.

213
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,620
Yet when Abraham says to those young men

214
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,080
that he leaves behind,

215
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,040
it was only Abraham and Isaac

216
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,760
that would make that trek up that mountain.

217
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,279
And he says that we will come again to you.

218
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,779
The faith of Abraham.

219
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,500
I mentioned it during Sunday school this morning,

220
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,119
but turn over to Hebrews chapter 11.

221
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,040
Hold your place here in Genesis 22.

222
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,920
We'll be right back into that passage.

223
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,760
But in Hebrews chapter 11,

224
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
we see the record that is given to us

225
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,440
in the hall of faith chapter of this event in Genesis 22.

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,959
And we find here that in Genesis chapter 22,

227
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
or in Hebrews 11,

228
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,119
that there's some further insight that is given to us.

229
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,640
It says in verse number 17,

230
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,200
by faith Abraham, when he was tried,

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,239
offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises

232
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,000
offered up his only begotten son

233
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,040
of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

234
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,679
Notice verse number 19.

235
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,160
Accounting that God, what does the next word say?

236
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,820
Was able.

237
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,580
That God was able to raise him up

238
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,179
even from the dead.

239
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,080
From whence also he received him in a figure.

240
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,380
I asked this in Sunday school this morning.

241
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,899
In our Bibles, as we read Genesis 1 through Genesis 21,

242
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,140
how many people did God raise from the dead?

243
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,420
Zero.

244
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,520
I don't know of any.

245
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,860
I've read the book of Genesis,

246
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
I can't tell you how many times.

247
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,700
I don't know of any that God raised from the dead

248
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,179
in Genesis 1 through 21.

249
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,779
And by the way, Abraham didn't have a Bible, did he?

250
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,339
No, he didn't have a Bible.

251
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,779
And yet he believed that God was able

252
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,739
to do something that he had never seen God do,

253
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,739
nor had he ever heard of God doing.

254
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,899
That's amazing to me.

255
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,300
That is phenomenal to me.

256
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,739
That is faith at a completely different level in my mind.

257
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,380
Because we have this whole book.

258
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,660
I don't know for sure how many people

259
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,940
God raised from the dead in this book.

260
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,339
I didn't count it up ahead of time,

261
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,940
but there's plenty of examples

262
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,059
of those that God raised from the dead.

263
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,140
There are plenty of examples of God demonstrating His power

264
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,860
and proving His capabilities.

265
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,739
We sing, He is able, He is able.

266
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:55,140
I know He is able.

267
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,540
We sing all sorts of songs about the power of God,

268
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,899
but yet we find Abraham here in Genesis 22,

269
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,179
according to what Hebrews 11 tells us,

270
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,580
that he accounted that God was able

271
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,940
to raise him from the dead.

272
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,739
That's phenomenal to me.

273
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:16,380
That is faith at a whole nother level.

274
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,860
He says that they would come again to you.

275
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,100
He says to those young men,

276
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,339
notice back in Genesis 22 in verse number six,

277
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,179
the Bible says,

278
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,020
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering

279
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,660
and laid it upon Isaac his son.

280
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,899
He took the fire in his hand and a knife,

281
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:31,380
and they went both of them together.

282
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,059
I want you to notice in verse seven,

283
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,300
the piercing question that is asked by Isaac.

284
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,380
It says, and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father.

285
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,619
And notice what Isaac says.

286
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,700
He says, my father.

287
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,860
And he said, here am I, my son.

288
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,500
He said, behold, the fire and the wood.

289
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,339
But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

290
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,220
I can't imagine Abraham hearing those words from his son.

291
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,580
Can you?

292
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,980
Put yourself in the dialogue.

293
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,459
Put yourself in the account.

294
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,380
They're walking up the mountain.

295
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,179
The Bible tells us in verse six

296
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,500
that he took the fire in his hand.

297
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,020
He had put the wood.

298
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,220
He laid it upon Isaac.

299
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,940
He took the fire in his hand, a knife,

300
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,980
and they went up both of them together.

301
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,420
And Isaac says, I see the wood and I see the fire,

302
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,540
but where's the lamb for a burnt offering?

303
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,220
It's a piercing question.

304
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,299
But we see a prophetic response in verse number eight.

305
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,059
I don't know that Abraham even understood

306
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,380
how prophetic this response was.

307
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,059
But the Bible says in verse number eight

308
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,900
that Abraham said, my son,

309
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,900
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.

310
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,299
So they went both of them together.

311
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,260
You see the faith again of Abraham here in verse number eight

312
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,340
and he says that God will provide himself a lamb

313
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,460
for a burnt offering.

314
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,059
And what a blessing to understand the prophetic nature

315
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,299
of the statement that is made,

316
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,299
the response to that question.

317
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,260
When Isaac says, where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

318
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,500
We find the Bible tells us in verse nine,

319
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,539
and they came to the place which God had told him of,

320
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,900
and Abraham built an altar there

321
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,739
and laid the wood in order.

322
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,260
And notice the end of verse number nine,

323
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,539
and bound Isaac, his son,

324
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,340
and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

325
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,900
I mentioned by way of introduction

326
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,859
of the first point of the unknown time

327
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,299
that had lapsed between the events of chapter 21

328
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,940
and here in chapter 22,

329
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,940
but the common agreement as to the age of Isaac.

330
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,820
I want you to note that Abraham was willing

331
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,260
to make the full surrender.

332
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,380
He was willing to do what God told him to do,

333
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,179
to fully obey, but Isaac had to be willing.

334
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:08,299
as well. As a teenager nearing the age of 20, Abraham now at this point a hundred

335
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:17,299
and twenty or so, no doubt we find that Isaac could have resisted. But the Bible

336
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,379
says that Abraham bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

337
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:27,019
In verse number 10 says that Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the

338
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:34,459
knife to slay his son. He wasn't just going through some motions. He wasn't

339
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:38,699
just putting on a facade of obedience and surrender. He wasn't making it as if

340
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:45,739
he was trying to impress somebody with his faith in God. He was going all the

341
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:54,099
way. In my mind's eye this evening I see Abraham with the altar there and Isaac

342
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:59,739
bound upon that altar and I see Abraham raising up his hand with that knife. I

343
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:07,099
can't even comprehend it. I'm just being honest with you. I cannot comprehend it.

344
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:15,779
Abraham passed the test. The Bible says in verse number 11, and the angel of the

345
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,779
Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, here am I.

346
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:26,899
He said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now

347
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:33,419
I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,

348
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:40,579
from me. I want you to understand in verse number 12 that God knows all

349
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:46,579
things. He's omniscient. He's eternal. And I understand that he says here in this

350
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:51,419
text of Scripture, for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld

351
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,339
thy son, thine only son, from me. But I want you to think about it from this perspective

352
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:02,339
that Abraham not only was this proof in this knowledge of God, but Abraham also understood

353
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:10,500
that he loved and obeyed God supremely. He was willing to give up everything in obedience

354
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:18,179
to God. And I just wonder, and I'm so thankful that as I look at a passage of Scripture such

355
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:26,379
as this, that I've not been given the assignment. I've not been given this test. But I just

356
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:33,379
wonder in the comfort of Christianity in 2021, how many times we've held on to things that

357
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:40,539
we're just not willing to surrender to God. I'm not saying that we need to surrender anything

358
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:47,539
to God. I'm saying if God speaks to us personally about surrendering, about sacrificing, about

359
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:54,619
what is it that I would be willing to give up for God. And really the reality is that

360
00:22:55,579 --> 00:23:00,059
I'm not really giving it up for God, and that's the term that I just used and the term that

361
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:07,099
so often is used, because the reality is that God will be debtor to no man. But the blessing

362
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:14,339
that we receive through the obedience to God and what we get to see God do so often is

363
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:20,459
not realized in our lives. Why? Because we're not willing to walk the road that Abraham

364
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:27,459
walked. We're not willing to go all the way in. We so often, as we look at those that

365
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:35,379
have gone before us, those in Scripture, those that have gone on before us to go to various

366
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:40,819
places of the world, those that we even still support today, missions that are going to

367
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,419
some of these places around the globe that are restricted access type places. And we

368
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,059
look at them and we say, man, why would they be willing to do that? Why would they be willing

369
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:58,059
to give that up? Because they love God supremely and God said, go. And they said, here am I,

370
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:05,379
send me. And sometimes we look and we say, from a human perspective, but you have all

371
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:10,339
of this opportunity, you have all of this, but if God told me to do it, I better obey

372
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:17,339
God. Amen? And we think about this passage of Scripture. This was not Abraham just deciding

373
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,220
on his own that he was going to do this. This was God instructing Abraham and Abraham obeying

374
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,539
God. And Abraham passes the test and what a great testimony. What a picture of surrender

375
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:34,539
and sacrifice. What a picture of faith and obedience. And we see that in verse number

376
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:41,539
13, in verse number 14, that God indeed provided. The Bible says, and Abraham lifted up his eyes

377
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:49,019
and looked and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went

378
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,339
and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering, notice this, in the stead

379
00:24:54,339 --> 00:25:00,899
of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-Jireh, as it is said to

380
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:07,899
this day in the mount of the Lord, it shall be seen. Jehovah-Jireh, the God who provides

381
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:15,899
and the reality is that here he provided a ram. He had said in verse number 8 that God

382
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,500
will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. In verses 13 and 14, we see the provision

383
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:28,339
of God and we understand no doubt the delight that Abraham must have had when he saw that

384
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:35,339
ram that was caught in a thicket by his horns. Can you imagine? His faith was rewarded. What

385
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:43,339
he had believed that God was able to do, he sees that God is not going to require him

386
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,979
to actually offer his son, but that God indeed provided this sacrifice and he was able to

387
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:56,979
offer this ram as an offering in the stead of his son. I think Isaac was probably pretty

388
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:04,979
delighted as well. Amen? Can you imagine the process? Can you imagine as Isaac had been

389
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:16,779
bound and laying upon the altar and God has the angel call out in verse number 11 and

390
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,139
Abraham as he's got his hands stretched forth ready to slay his son in obedience to what

391
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:26,699
God has told him to do, that he then hears the voice of God speaking to him and then

392
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:31,259
he sees that ram that's caught in a thicket and all of a sudden now we're going to unloose

393
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:38,259
Isaac and bring Isaac off of that altar. We're going to put that ram upon that altar. The

394
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,820
provision of God. Abraham passed the test. The reality is that I believe that at times

395
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,820
in our lives we think that we would be willing to give up anything for God. Perhaps we'd

396
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,059
even stand and testify of our willingness to go and do whatever it is that He would

397
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,699
call us to do. Perhaps it's that we'd be willing to stand and say, I'd be willing to die for

398
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:15,699
Christ. Can I remind you of Peter? Did he not say that he was willing to die for Christ?

399
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:23,179
And what did Jesus say to Peter? Before the cock crow twice, you're going to deny me thrice.

400
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:29,500
Sometimes we think that we'd be willing to offer and sacrifice and yield a whole lot

401
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,419
more than we actually would be. As we look at a passage of scripture like this, man,

402
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:41,419
the conviction is deep for me to think about the level at which the sacrifice is made and

403
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:49,419
the obedience. Obeying no matter the cost. The Bible then records for us the confirmation,

404
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:00,859
really the reconfirmation in verses 15 through 18 of the Abrahamic Covenant. The Bible says

405
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,579
the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said, By

406
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:09,859
myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld

407
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,779
thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply

408
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:18,539
thy seed as the stars of the heaven, as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed

409
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,500
shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth

410
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,500
be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. They return and go to Beersheba according

411
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:35,419
to verse 19. It says, So Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went

412
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:40,940
together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. Verses 20 through 24 are given

413
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,260
to us almost as an addendum, if you will, to this passage of Scripture. And I believe

414
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:51,460
the main point of verses 20 through 24 is to introduce to us into the narrative of the

415
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,779
record of Genesis, Rebecca, who of course would be the wife of Isaac, as we'll get

416
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,179
to here in just a little while as we continue studying through the book of Genesis. But

417
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:05,020
you notice in verse 20, it says that it came to pass after these things that it was told

418
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,979
Abraham saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor, Huz,

419
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:16,979
his firstborn, and Buz, his brother, and Chemuel, the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and

420
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:23,580
Pildash, and Jitlaph, and Bethuel. And Bethuel begat Rebecca. These eight, Milcah, did bear

421
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,859
to Nahor, Abraham's brother and his concubine, whose name was Reuma. She bare also Teba and

422
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:35,580
Gaham and Tehash and Mekah. As you look at the introduction here, of course, to Rebecca

423
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,339
that is given to us in verse number 23 specifically, and of course as we continue reading in chapter

424
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,539
number 24, we'll read of the marriage of Isaac and just how God had directed the servant

425
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,320
of Abraham and so on and so forth, but we find that these verses are provided to us

426
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,299
in the narrative to introduce Rebecca. Now, as we kind of finish up this evening, we've

427
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,299
noted the test and testimony of Abraham. I want you to see the

428
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,899
the type of Christ that is given to us.

429
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,179
It's a type that is provided.

430
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,779
Oftentimes throughout the scriptures,

431
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,579
you see these pictures or these types,

432
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,299
the typologies that God would provide.

433
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:14,779
And what a tremendous type is provided to us here

434
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,819
of the picture of the reality that one day,

435
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,859
the Lord Jesus Christ would go to the cross of Calvary

436
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,859
to pay for the sin of mankind.

437
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:26,379
Now we understand looking at this perspective

438
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,179
and from this side of history,

439
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,539
that this has already taken place.

440
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,659
But in Genesis 22, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ

441
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:39,539
was way in the distance from a timeline perspective,

442
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,739
but yet we find there's a beautiful picture

443
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,819
that is provided here for us.

444
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:48,539
In 1 Peter 1, we note that the Bible says this,

445
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,659
with regard to the coming of Christ

446
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,339
and the purpose of his coming,

447
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,659
of course, God created all things

448
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,379
as we've studied in the book of Genesis,

449
00:30:58,379 --> 00:30:59,899
and we understand that he created Adam

450
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,179
and Eve in a perfect environment,

451
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,219
but the enemy, Satan, the serpent,

452
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:08,219
who is more subtle than any beast of the field,

453
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,499
came and tempted, and we find that sin

454
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,139
entered into the world in Genesis 3,

455
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:17,259
and we understand the effects and consequences of that sin,

456
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:21,139
but we are mindful of the fact that God tells us

457
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,139
in 1 Peter 1, in verses 18 through 20,

458
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,619
notice what the Bible says,

459
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:29,259
for as much as you know that you are not redeemed

460
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,939
with corruptible things as silver and gold

461
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:34,979
from your vain conversation received by tradition

462
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,419
from your fathers,

463
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,819
but with the precious blood of Christ

464
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,659
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,

465
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,019
notice verse 20, who verily was foreordained

466
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:48,659
before the foundation of the world,

467
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,699
but was manifest in these last times for you

468
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:54,059
who by him do believe in God

469
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,259
that raised him up from the dead

470
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,579
and gave him glory that your faith and hope

471
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:02,139
might be in God.

472
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,939
I want you to understand that in Genesis 3,

473
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:07,059
when sin entered into the world,

474
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,779
God was not in heaven wringing his hands

475
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,619
and saying, now what are we gonna do?

476
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,699
Because God, in his omniscience and his eternality,

477
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:20,339
he knew that though he had created man

478
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,219
in a perfect environment, in a perfect state,

479
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,419
he knew that man would sin

480
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,939
and he had already made provision for the remedy.

481
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,259
He had already made a way for man

482
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,659
to be reconciled to himself.

483
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,979
And as we look at Genesis chapter number 22,

484
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:40,059
we see this great picture, this great type

485
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,739
of when Christ would be offered on Calvary

486
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:45,779
and we understand that that provision was already made,

487
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,419
but we understand as we look here

488
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:48,779
at the passage of Scripture

489
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,619
and kind of rehearse some of the things

490
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,779
that we've already looked at where the Bible says,

491
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,619
take now thy son, in verse number two,

492
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:57,019
thine only son, whom thou lovest.

493
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,779
You know, it's interesting,

494
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,579
the Bible tells us that God is love

495
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,779
and we see many things about love

496
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,139
throughout the word of God,

497
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:06,339
but if you were to read the gospel accounts

498
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:08,659
in Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

499
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,499
you will find that the first time the word love

500
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:13,499
is mentioned in each of the gospels,

501
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:14,859
Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

502
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,299
is at the time of the baptism of Jesus

503
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,179
when God the Father says,

504
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,619
this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

505
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,419
So God the Father speaking of His love for the Son,

506
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,979
Matthew chapter number three in verse 17,

507
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,979
Mark one in verse number 11,

508
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,739
Luke three in verse number 22.

509
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,499
But it's interesting when you come to the book of John,

510
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,979
the first reference that you have to the word love

511
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,179
in the book of John is that verse of Scripture

512
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:46,259
that is so familiar to us,

513
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,739
for God so loved the world.

514
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:54,899
That He gave His only begotten Son.

515
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,699
The one that He loved.

516
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,379
The one that He says in Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

517
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:02,339
this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

518
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,779
For God so loved the world

519
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,419
that He gave His only begotten Son

520
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,379
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish

521
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,899
but have everlasting life.

522
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,819
The love that God has,

523
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,619
the Father has for His Son,

524
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,299
but the love that God has for us.

525
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,859
The love that He has for His creation

526
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,220
and through that love,

527
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,859
we find that He was willing to pay for the sin of mankind.

528
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:27,779
I would say this,

529
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,859
it was the only payment that could be acceptable.

530
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:34,099
It required that God and the person of Jesus Christ

531
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:37,379
die in the place of us, of mankind.

532
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,259
We notice the Bible says in verse number four

533
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,739
that on that third day Abraham lifted up his eyes

534
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,940
and saw the place afar off.

535
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,019
It's interesting if you were to look at Luke 23

536
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,379
and verse number 33,

537
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,579
it talks about seeing the place

538
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,659
where Christ would be crucified.

539
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,299
And if you take and you go to the Gospel records

540
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:00,099
of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ

541
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,419
and you understand what takes place,

542
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:05,259
we find that here as we look at this picture

543
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,099
in Genesis chapter number 22,

544
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,059
we find the Bible says that there was a ram

545
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:13,099
that was provided that was caught in a thicket by his horns

546
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,419
in verse number 13,

547
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:17,699
and that Abraham was able to offer that ram

548
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,819
in the stead of his son.

549
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:21,059
But I want you to understand that Jesus Christ,

550
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,419
the God in flesh,

551
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:24,899
He went all the way to the cross of Calvary

552
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:26,619
and He shed His precious blood

553
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:31,619
and He died a horrific death for us.

554
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,259
For us.

555
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,059
Because He loved us so much.

556
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:38,619
And I would say this,

557
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,940
it was in my place, right?

558
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,519
It was in your place.

559
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,599
The ram was sacrificed in the place of Isaac,

560
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,639
but the Son of God was sacrificed in my place.

561
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,119
It was my death that I should have died.

562
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,359
It was your death that you should have died.

563
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,919
It was our cross that we deserve.

564
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,679
Correct?

565
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,839
That's what we deserve.

566
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:10,539
A healthy dose of Bible would help our society by the way.

567
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,379
Amen?

568
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,699
But the reality is that there are times

569
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,379
in which we look at this and we see,

570
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:18,940
and we notice this type here and we say,

571
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,940
aren't you so glad that Jesus was willing to pay it all?

572
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:25,539
Right?

573
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:29,139
We sing songs about what He did for us

574
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:31,819
and how He gave it all.

575
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,859
He went the whole distance.

576
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,699
Peter tried to rebuke Him, correct?

577
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,179
Satan, no doubt in my mind,

578
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,299
many times as you read the Gospel accounts,

579
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:51,339
Satan tried to have Jesus killed

580
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,779
before He could ever get to the cross of Calvary.

581
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,459
You read the Gospel accounts and you see many instances.

582
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,659
If He would have died any other way,

583
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,599
it would not have fulfilled prophecy.

584
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,319
He had to go to that cross.

585
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
And I want you to understand from Hebrews

586
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,459
that He went to that cross willingly

587
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:18,459
for the joy that was set before Him.

588
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:20,220
What was that joy?

589
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,259
He knew He was paying for our sin.

590
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,099
He was able to say, it is finished.

591
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,859
I've paid for the sin of mankind.

592
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:35,500
He cried out prior to that, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,

593
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,940
my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me

594
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,099
when the sin of the world was poured,

595
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,739
the wrath of God was poured upon God the Son.

596
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,859
He turned His back, it turned dark

597
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:47,459
and all that took place,

598
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:51,199
but we find that He was willing to do that,

599
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,739
the joy that was set before Him

600
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,579
so that we could be redeemed, we could be reconciled.

601
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,399
Why?

602
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,299
Because there's no other way.

603
00:37:58,299 --> 00:37:59,459
There's no other way.

604
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:05,859
Jesus paid it all and the songwriter said all to Him I owe.

605
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:10,220
Right?

606
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,339
I surrender all, we sing the song.

607
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,500
Someone told me a number of years ago

608
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:20,940
that it was that actual song that convicted them deeply

609
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,259
for they had sat in church for years

610
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,419
and they had kind of played the part.

611
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:32,259
And I remember singing one day, I surrender all.

612
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,799
It was as if the Holy Spirit of God whispered to their ear

613
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,700
and said, no, you haven't.

614
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,880
At best, you've surrendered some.

615
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,859
This is that person's testimony.

616
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,019
They told it to me in their living room.

617
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,500
And it was at that moment, I've not been perfect

618
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,419
and I've not always surrendered all,

619
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,779
was at that moment that it got real in my life to serve God.

620
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,719
Because I understood that I could sing a song,

621
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,739
but I could lie as I sang it.

622
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:10,820
Because they had not truly surrendered all.

623
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:13,979
I'm thankful that Christ went all the way.

624
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,080
The people that mocked, as I mentioned last week

625
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,219
as we observed the Lord's Supper,

626
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:25,019
if you're who you say you are, come down.

627
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:31,239
He saved others, but He can't save Himself.

628
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:35,820
I'm thankful He didn't come off of that cross

629
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,539
until He had paid for the sin of mankind.

630
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:39,380
Aren't you?

631
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,679
He could have called angels.

632
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,779
I remember speaking to a young man

633
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,500
when I was in high school, a senior in high school,

634
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,159
and he said this to me.

635
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,039
He said, you're telling me that Jesus loved me

636
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:53,959
and He died for me?

637
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,919
He didn't have a choice.

638
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:58,959
He was arrested and those soldiers took Him

639
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,399
and he had no choice.

640
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:03,799
And I said, what you don't understand is that the Gospels tell us that He could have called

641
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:13,119
legions of angels, but He didn't because it was love that took Him to that cross.

642
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,279
I can't fully comprehend Genesis 22.

643
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,639
I honestly can't.

644
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,479
The test and testimony of Abraham is phenomenal.

645
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:27,979
It is absolutely convicting to me every time I read it.

646
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:33,759
As I prepared for the message this week, understanding that this was the passage in which we deal

647
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:41,699
with the conviction again of studying and considering the events of Genesis 22, it is

648
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:51,719
a mountain peak in God's Word, only to be surpassed by the mount that Jesus died for

649
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,879
our sin.

650
00:40:53,879 --> 00:41:02,179
But I wonder how far up the mountain of Genesis 22 I have been willing to go.

651
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:08,879
At what point in my life, and I'd ask you to ask yourself the same questions, that I've

652
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:16,839
said this is kind of as far as I'm going to go, this is as much as I'm willing to surrender,

653
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:23,759
this is as far as I'm willing to make sacrifice, or are we just really all in?

654
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:25,439
I'm yours.

655
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,179
I'm going to present my body a living sacrifice.

656
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:32,359
Can we truly say, here am I, Lord, send me?

657
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,739
And if God says, I want you to go to, you just fill in a country.

658
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:45,959
Are we willing to quit our jobs and leave everything that America has given us and say,

659
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:48,919
I'm following Jesus?

660
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:53,479
Because I'm willing to surrender all.

661
00:41:54,199 --> 00:42:00,839
I believe that the testimony of Abraham is easily summarized by two phrases, faith and

662
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,559
obedience, surrender and sacrifice.

663
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,919
Oh, how much do we believe God?

664
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:13,519
He believed that God could do something that had never been done, that God could raise

665
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,839
up His Son.

666
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:26,919
He obeyed God immediately, without hesitation, to do, in my mind, the unthinkable, the surrender

667
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,359
and the sacrifice.

668
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,799
Oh, I hope tonight that we're encouraged of the type, from this passage of Scripture,

669
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:37,459
the picture of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

670
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:46,299
But I hope tonight that God would help us to really do some self-examination and say,

671
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,379
how would I have responded?

672
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:50,939
Or what is it in my life?

673
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:54,579
What is it that God's putting His thumb on in my life?

674
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,979
He's saying, are you willing to surrender this?

675
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:04,459
What is it that you're unwilling to give up for me?

676
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:11,379
And I tell you that there should be nothing in our lives that's more precious to us than

677
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:12,979
following Jesus.

678
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:13,979
Amen?

679
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:19,459
Honestly, nothing should be more precious to us than following Jesus.

680
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:22,579
We sing, I'll go where you want me to go, I'll do what you want me to do.

681
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,739
I'm not suggesting that all of you should quit your jobs.

682
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:28,939
In fact, it would make me afraid if you all quit your jobs.

683
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,179
But what I'm suggesting is that we just say, God, I'm Yours.

684
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:32,179
What do You want me to do?

685
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:33,219
What do You want me to do?

686
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:35,139
Where do You want me to go?

687
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:37,099
The faith and obedience of Abraham.

688
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,099
Let's pray.

689
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:42,499
Father, thank You for the passage.

690
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:50,459
I'm not sure that I could ever do justice to explaining or seeking to give commentary

691
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:54,299
on such a passage of Scripture.

692
00:43:54,299 --> 00:44:00,099
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God has used the Word of God tonight to speak to the hearts

693
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:05,779
of Your people.

694
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:16,099
I'm so thankful for the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

695
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:23,219
The type, the picture that we see here in Genesis 22 of that event that has now passed

696
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:25,299
historically.

697
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:33,019
The time of this event was in the far distant future, but I rest my attention upon Abraham

698
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:39,019
tonight, his faith, his obedience, his surrender, his sacrifice.

699
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:47,859
God, I pray that You'd work in my heart and our lives collectively, individually.

700
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,499
Help us to surrender all.

701
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:57,619
Help us to be willing to give up whatever it is that You would require of us to give

702
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:08,379
up from our human perspective in the pursuit of Your perfect will for our lives.

703
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:10,299
We ask that You'd move and work as only You can.

704
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:11,579
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

705
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:11,859
Would You stand with us?
