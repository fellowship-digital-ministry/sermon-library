00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
powerful passage of Scripture that really reveals to us not only the faith

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.119
and obedience of Abraham, but it's one of the the mountain peaks of Scripture, if

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.040
you will. Obviously within the context we look at Mount Moriah being here and look

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.200
at all that has taken place, but when you think about the mountain peaks of

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.360
Scripture, aside from Mount Calvary, this is probably the highest point,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.120
spiritually speaking, of all of the Scripture, what takes place here at Mount

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.040
Moriah. As we look at the passage of Scripture and as we are mindful of the,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.319
you know, historical account that takes place and obviously have the ability to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:45.599
learn very important life lessons, we also are mindful of the fact that this

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:51.919
passage of Scripture provides us with a beautiful type of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:57.400
in his substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary for the sin of mankind.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.000
And I'm so thankful for the picture that is provided in this passage of Scripture.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.519
Before we get to that particular picture, let's look at the passage and

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.480
deal with the content here historically. If you are taking notes, we're going to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.400
dig right into it this evening. Number one, I want you to notice the test for

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.000
Abraham. Verses one and two provide us with the test for Abraham. The Bible says

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.800
this, and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.760
said unto him, Abraham, and he said, behold, here I am. And he, God, said, take now thy

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.279
son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:41.959
Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.480
which I will tell thee of. Now, as you look at this passage of Scripture and begin to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.680
notice the test for Abraham, we understand that it begins by saying, and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.279
it came to pass after these things. We are not sure as to how much time has

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.800
passed between the events of chapter 20 and 21. Specifically, as you look at

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.879
chapter number 21 and all that has taken place, obviously the birth of Isaac, the

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.800
weaning of Isaac, and then of course the casting out of Ishmael and Hagar and all

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.080
that takes place with Abimelech, excuse me, yes, as we look at Abimelech at the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.720
end of the passage. And so you look at all of these things, but God tells us

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.520
that it came to pass after these things. Bible scholars typically agree on the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.479
fact that Isaac at this point was at least a teenager. We don't know the exact

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.839
age of Isaac, but it's agreeable, it's common that we would believe that he was

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:42.559
a teenager. In fact, if you look at verse number five, the Bible says here, and

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:48.240
Abraham said unto his young men, abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.399
will go yonder and worship and come again to you. And so he speaks to the

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:59.199
young men and assigns them to stay with the livestock, but then he says this, I

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:06.080
and the lad, speaking of Isaac, the Hebrew word for young men and lad are the same

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.360
exact Hebrew word. And so it would be obvious that Isaac is not just a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.119
five- or six-year-old little kid at this particular time. It seems that he at

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:21.119
least would be a teenager, maybe even as old as being 20 years old. We give you

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.240
that content to kind of understand what's going on here with the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.160
timeline, but I want you to notice in verse number one that it says that God

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.960
did tempt Abraham. Now that word tempt, it's important that we understand that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.199
that word means to test, to try, or to prove. We know that God does not tempt

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.679
men with evil, with sin. We understand that biblically. James is very clear on

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:52.240
that. In fact, as you look at Hebrews 11, the Bible, speaking of this particular

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.360
event of Genesis 22, says of Abraham when he was tried. And the word, it's a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.759
proper interpretation of the word, and it's understood that it means to test or

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:09.240
to prove or to try. And so we find that, as I've mentioned, the test for Abraham

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.240
is given here in this passage of Scripture. You see that the Bible says

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.720
that God did tempt Abraham, and notice it says that he called unto him, he said

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.600
Abraham, and Abraham responded, here I am. And here comes the test, here comes the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.079
assignment. Notice the instruction that is provided in verse number two. God says

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:37.320
to Abraham, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac. Notice these words, whom thou

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.519
lovest. Now, Isaac was born in chapter number 21. We looked at that several

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:47.480
weeks ago, and as we look at the birth of Isaac, we made this statement that

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.239
Abraham had believed God and had waited on God for 25 years from the first

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:59.040
giving of the promise that Abraham would have a seed, and we find that that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.160
promise is fulfilled just as God said it would be fulfilled in chapter 21. And now,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.559
God says, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest. Okay? We're

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.200
clear, we understand, this is okay at this point. He says this, and get thee into

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.119
the land of Moriah. Okay? I understand I'm supposed to get my son, I understand I'm

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.480
supposed to go to the land of Moriah. And then he says this, and offer him there

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.399
for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. That

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:38.239
gets real tough, doesn't it? Gets real tough. And as we look at the passage of

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:44.040
Scripture, I find oftentimes in our lives, that as we look to the Word of God, that

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.320
there are times in which we question things that are recorded in the Word of

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:54.640
God, when the actual characters that were involved never questioned God. Does

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.440
there strike you in that fashion, where we question, well, why did God tell

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.239
Abraham to do this, and why this, and why that, and so on and so forth? Abraham

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:10.079
doesn't ask God why. Abraham receives the instruction, very detailed, very specific

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:15.920
instruction. He tells him what he is to do, where he is to go, and what is to take

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.200
place there. And he tells him that he's to offer there his son Isaac, his only

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.279
son, the one that he loves, the one that had been promised, the one that he waited

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.559
on, that he's to offer him as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:38.799
I will tell thee of. Now think about that. That's a challenge. I'm not sure this

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:45.519
evening, if we were faced with a test of this magnitude, if I were to be honest

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.519
with you this evening, if you were to be honest with me, if we're to be honest

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:55.119
with one another and honest before God, I'm not sure how well we would do. Is

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.600
that a fair statement? I'm being very transparent with you tonight. I'm not

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.480
sure how well we would do. There are times in which God asks us to give up

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.000
far less than what he's speaking to Abraham about tonight, and we resist it.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.359
Right? We resist it. Why do I have to do that? Why do I have to do this? Why that?

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.920
And we resist it. And as we look at this passage of Scripture, and we look at this

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.160
test, and we we notice the magnitude of what's happening, now understand as we go

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.279
through the passage tonight, we're gonna understand the picture, the type that is

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:37.320
provided for us, but Abraham's a man like me and you. He's made of the same flesh.

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:46.040
He waited for this son, Isaac, and God had repeatedly told Abraham that he was

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.440
going to have descendants, and he said that those descendants were gonna be

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.119
like the stars of the heavens and like the sand of the seas, right? I mean, that's

00:07:55.119 --> 00:08:00.760
the imagery, the truth that God gives to Abraham, and now Abraham, before

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.640
Isaac is married, before Isaac has any children, Abraham is being told by God to

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.119
take this son, your only son, the one that you love, and offer him as a burnt

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:17.399
offering upon one of the mountains that I will tell thee of. We notice the test

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:23.079
for Abraham. The next, really almost the entirety of the passage, we'll make some

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:28.119
comments about verses 20 through 24, but in verses 3 through 19, I notice the

00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:34.159
testimony of Abraham. The testimony of Abraham. Someone said this, there's no

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:41.919
testimony without a test. Obviously, it's a play on words because you need T-E-S-T

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.799
in order to start the word testimony, and so you have no testimony without a test.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:51.119
And here, when we read the testimony of Abraham, and we'll go verse by verse

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:55.679
through this and dissect it and understand what's taking place, but I

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:01.320
would summarize the testimony of Abraham in two ways. One, that we've used by way

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.599
of our title this evening, his faith and his obedience. But I also would offer

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:12.679
this summary of the testimony of Abraham in this passage of Scripture. It's one of

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:18.239
surrender and sacrifice. I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:21.280
there are a few other portions of Scripture that you can go to in all of

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.719
the Word of God to see a level of surrender that we see here in Genesis 22.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.479
We find that often as we speak about the importance of surrender, and Murray wrote

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:37.559
a book many years ago on this subject, Andrew Murray, on absolute surrender, and

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:41.719
I've often, as I've read that book, I've actually read it several times, and we

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:45.520
think about the truth of absolute surrender, and we think about Paul as he

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.599
would say, I am crucified with Christ in Galatians 2.20. We think of the

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:54.840
admonition in Romans 12 that were to present our bodies a living sacrifice,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.880
wholly acceptable unto God, and he says this, which is your reasonable service.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.600
and we think about this thought of absolute surrender,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.640
and in here in this passage of Scripture,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.360
not only do we see the faith and obedience of Abraham,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.860
but we see the surrender and sacrifice.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.400
And I wonder tonight, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.440
I wonder tonight, is there something in my life,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.780
is there something in your life

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.000
that we're holding on to so tight

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.540
that we'd not be willing to give up for God?

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.320
I don't know what that something is.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.600
I don't know in our lives,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.800
but I just wonder if we look at a passage like this,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.520
and we see the faith and obedience,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.160
and we see the surrender and the sacrifice,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.700
I wonder in 2021, what is it that I'm holding on to?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.980
What is it that I'm unwilling to surrender to God

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.780
that I'm not trusting or believing God for?

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040
Because this test right here

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.620
is a test that none of us

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.660
are gonna actually ever have to face.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.340
God's never gonna ask you to sacrifice your son or daughter.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.320
He's not going to.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.300
So anything that we would give up is far less

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.420
than what Abraham is assigned to do.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.260
Would you agree?

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.140
And here, as we look at the testimony of Abraham,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.180
notice in verse number three, the Bible says,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.180
and Abraham rose up early in the morning

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.560
and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.720
and Isaac, his son,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.720
and claimed the wood for the burnt offering

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.520
and rose up and went into the place

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.060
of which God had told him.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.280
If you just let verse number three

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.080
sink into your mind this evening,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.680
into your heart this evening,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.400
you see the immediate response of Abraham

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.120
of being obedience.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.960
I mean, absolute obedience.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.820
No questioning, no delay.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.500
The Bible says that he rose up early in the morning.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.080
If there was ever a day to sleep in,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.940
perhaps it would have been that day.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.700
You understand what I'm saying?

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.220
If there was ever a day to have some delay

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.180
in what you're doing,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.279
has there ever been a task that you've had to do

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.840
that you say, I just really am pushing it off

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.240
as long as I possibly can

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.040
because I really don't wanna do that thing.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.779
I know I have to do it,

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:19.400
but I really don't wanna get around to doing it.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.700
The Bible tells us when Abraham receives this instruction

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.120
from God that he rose up early in the morning.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.100
Immediate obedience.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.139
It's absolutely convicting to me

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:36.900
when I read this passage of Scripture.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.040
To see the character of Abraham,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.960
to see the faith and the obedience of Abraham.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.680
It says that he went to the place

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.639
of which God had told him.

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.200
Notice in verse number four,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.460
then on the third day,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.220
Abraham lifted up his eyes

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.779
and saw the place afar off.

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:58.820
God told Abraham that he was going to tell him

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.960
at the end of verse number two

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.980
on one of the mountains,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.540
which I will tell thee of.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.059
And so God had made it clear that this is the place.

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:07.279
It's interesting that it says on the third day.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:09.059
And we as Bible believers,

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:10.740
as New Testament believers,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.779
we understand the significance

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:15.080
of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.340
on the third day.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.860
And what a blessing that is.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:20.080
But we notice here that the Bible says

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.800
that Abraham lifted up his eyes

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.279
and he saw the place afar off.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:26.559
And Abraham said unto his young men,

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.240
abide ye here with the ass

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.580
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.559
And what does it say at the end of verse number five?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:35.680
And come again to you.

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.800
You saw his obedience in verse number three

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.680
when he immediately early rose up

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.620
and took and followed the direction

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.760
that God had given.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.240
And now in verse number five,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.620
we note his faith where the Bible says

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.000
that I and the lad will go yonder and worship.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.779
And he says, and come again to you.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:58.960
But what did God tell Abraham to do up at this mountain?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.400
To sacrifice his son.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:04.139
Is that not what God said in verse number two?

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:06.660
Offer him therefore a burnt offering

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.779
upon one of the mountains,

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.120
which I will tell thee of.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.620
Yet when Abraham says to those young men

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.080
that he leaves behind,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.040
it was only Abraham and Isaac

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.760
that would make that trek up that mountain.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.279
And he says that we will come again to you.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.779
The faith of Abraham.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.500
I mentioned it during Sunday school this morning,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.119
but turn over to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.040
Hold your place here in Genesis 22.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.920
We'll be right back into that passage.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.760
But in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.000
we see the record that is given to us

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.440
in the hall of faith chapter of this event in Genesis 22.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.959
And we find here that in Genesis chapter 22,

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.800
or in Hebrews 11,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.119
that there's some further insight that is given to us.

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:52.640
It says in verse number 17,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.200
by faith Abraham, when he was tried,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.239
offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:02.000
offered up his only begotten son

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.040
of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.679
Notice verse number 19.

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:12.160
Accounting that God, what does the next word say?

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.820
Was able.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.580
That God was able to raise him up

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.179
even from the dead.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.080
From whence also he received him in a figure.

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:33.380
I asked this in Sunday school this morning.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.899
In our Bibles, as we read Genesis 1 through Genesis 21,

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.140
how many people did God raise from the dead?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.420
Zero.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.520
I don't know of any.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.860
I've read the book of Genesis,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.860
I can't tell you how many times.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.700
I don't know of any that God raised from the dead

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.179
in Genesis 1 through 21.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.779
And by the way, Abraham didn't have a Bible, did he?

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.339
No, he didn't have a Bible.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.779
And yet he believed that God was able

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:12.739
to do something that he had never seen God do,

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:15.739
nor had he ever heard of God doing.

00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:17.899
That's amazing to me.

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:20.300
That is phenomenal to me.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.739
That is faith at a completely different level in my mind.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.380
Because we have this whole book.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.660
I don't know for sure how many people

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.940
God raised from the dead in this book.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.339
I didn't count it up ahead of time,

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:39.940
but there's plenty of examples

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.059
of those that God raised from the dead.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.140
There are plenty of examples of God demonstrating His power

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.860
and proving His capabilities.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.739
We sing, He is able, He is able.

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:55.140
I know He is able.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.540
We sing all sorts of songs about the power of God,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.899
but yet we find Abraham here in Genesis 22,

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:04.179
according to what Hebrews 11 tells us,

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:07.580
that he accounted that God was able

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.940
to raise him from the dead.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.739
That's phenomenal to me.

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:16.380
That is faith at a whole nother level.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.860
He says that they would come again to you.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.100
He says to those young men,

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.339
notice back in Genesis 22 in verse number six,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.179
the Bible says,

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:25.020
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.660
and laid it upon Isaac his son.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.899
He took the fire in his hand and a knife,

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.380
and they went both of them together.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.059
I want you to notice in verse seven,

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:36.300
the piercing question that is asked by Isaac.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.380
It says, and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.619
And notice what Isaac says.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:41.700
He says, my father.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.860
And he said, here am I, my son.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.500
He said, behold, the fire and the wood.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.339
But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.220
I can't imagine Abraham hearing those words from his son.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.580
Can you?

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.980
Put yourself in the dialogue.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.459
Put yourself in the account.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.380
They're walking up the mountain.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.179
The Bible tells us in verse six

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:14.500
that he took the fire in his hand.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.020
He had put the wood.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.220
He laid it upon Isaac.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.940
He took the fire in his hand, a knife,

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.980
and they went up both of them together.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.420
And Isaac says, I see the wood and I see the fire,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.540
but where's the lamb for a burnt offering?

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:30.220
It's a piercing question.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.299
But we see a prophetic response in verse number eight.

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:37.059
I don't know that Abraham even understood

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:40.380
how prophetic this response was.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.059
But the Bible says in verse number eight

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:43.900
that Abraham said, my son,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.900
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.299
So they went both of them together.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.260
You see the faith again of Abraham here in verse number eight

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.340
and he says that God will provide himself a lamb

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.460
for a burnt offering.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.059
And what a blessing to understand the prophetic nature

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:07.299
of the statement that is made,

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:09.299
the response to that question.

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:12.260
When Isaac says, where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.500
We find the Bible tells us in verse nine,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.539
and they came to the place which God had told him of,

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:19.900
and Abraham built an altar there

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.739
and laid the wood in order.

00:19:21.739 --> 00:19:23.260
And notice the end of verse number nine,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.539
and bound Isaac, his son,

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:29.340
and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.900
I mentioned by way of introduction

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.859
of the first point of the unknown time

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.299
that had lapsed between the events of chapter 21

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:41.940
and here in chapter 22,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.940
but the common agreement as to the age of Isaac.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.820
I want you to note that Abraham was willing

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.260
to make the full surrender.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.380
He was willing to do what God told him to do,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.179
to fully obey, but Isaac had to be willing.

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:08.299
as well. As a teenager nearing the age of 20, Abraham now at this point a hundred

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:17.299
and twenty or so, no doubt we find that Isaac could have resisted. But the Bible

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:21.379
says that Abraham bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:27.019
In verse number 10 says that Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:34.459
knife to slay his son. He wasn't just going through some motions. He wasn't

00:20:34.459 --> 00:20:38.699
just putting on a facade of obedience and surrender. He wasn't making it as if

00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:45.739
he was trying to impress somebody with his faith in God. He was going all the

00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:54.099
way. In my mind's eye this evening I see Abraham with the altar there and Isaac

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:59.739
bound upon that altar and I see Abraham raising up his hand with that knife. I

00:20:59.739 --> 00:21:07.099
can't even comprehend it. I'm just being honest with you. I cannot comprehend it.

00:21:08.659 --> 00:21:15.779
Abraham passed the test. The Bible says in verse number 11, and the angel of the

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:20.779
Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, here am I.

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:26.899
He said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:33.419
I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,

00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:40.579
from me. I want you to understand in verse number 12 that God knows all

00:21:40.579 --> 00:21:46.579
things. He's omniscient. He's eternal. And I understand that he says here in this

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:51.419
text of Scripture, for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:55.339
thy son, thine only son, from me. But I want you to think about it from this perspective

00:21:55.339 --> 00:22:02.339
that Abraham not only was this proof in this knowledge of God, but Abraham also understood

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:10.500
that he loved and obeyed God supremely. He was willing to give up everything in obedience

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:18.179
to God. And I just wonder, and I'm so thankful that as I look at a passage of Scripture such

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:26.379
as this, that I've not been given the assignment. I've not been given this test. But I just

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:33.379
wonder in the comfort of Christianity in 2021, how many times we've held on to things that

00:22:34.379 --> 00:22:40.539
we're just not willing to surrender to God. I'm not saying that we need to surrender anything

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:47.539
to God. I'm saying if God speaks to us personally about surrendering, about sacrificing, about

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:54.619
what is it that I would be willing to give up for God. And really the reality is that

00:22:55.579 --> 00:23:00.059
I'm not really giving it up for God, and that's the term that I just used and the term that

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:07.099
so often is used, because the reality is that God will be debtor to no man. But the blessing

00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:14.339
that we receive through the obedience to God and what we get to see God do so often is

00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:20.459
not realized in our lives. Why? Because we're not willing to walk the road that Abraham

00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:27.459
walked. We're not willing to go all the way in. We so often, as we look at those that

00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:35.379
have gone before us, those in Scripture, those that have gone on before us to go to various

00:23:35.379 --> 00:23:40.819
places of the world, those that we even still support today, missions that are going to

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:46.419
some of these places around the globe that are restricted access type places. And we

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:51.059
look at them and we say, man, why would they be willing to do that? Why would they be willing

00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:58.059
to give that up? Because they love God supremely and God said, go. And they said, here am I,

00:23:59.059 --> 00:24:05.379
send me. And sometimes we look and we say, from a human perspective, but you have all

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:10.339
of this opportunity, you have all of this, but if God told me to do it, I better obey

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:17.339
God. Amen? And we think about this passage of Scripture. This was not Abraham just deciding

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:23.220
on his own that he was going to do this. This was God instructing Abraham and Abraham obeying

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.539
God. And Abraham passes the test and what a great testimony. What a picture of surrender

00:24:28.539 --> 00:24:34.539
and sacrifice. What a picture of faith and obedience. And we see that in verse number

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:41.539
13, in verse number 14, that God indeed provided. The Bible says, and Abraham lifted up his eyes

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:49.019
and looked and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.339
and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering, notice this, in the stead

00:24:54.339 --> 00:25:00.899
of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-Jireh, as it is said to

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:07.899
this day in the mount of the Lord, it shall be seen. Jehovah-Jireh, the God who provides

00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:15.899
and the reality is that here he provided a ram. He had said in verse number 8 that God

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.500
will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. In verses 13 and 14, we see the provision

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:28.339
of God and we understand no doubt the delight that Abraham must have had when he saw that

00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:35.339
ram that was caught in a thicket by his horns. Can you imagine? His faith was rewarded. What

00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:43.339
he had believed that God was able to do, he sees that God is not going to require him

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.979
to actually offer his son, but that God indeed provided this sacrifice and he was able to

00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:56.979
offer this ram as an offering in the stead of his son. I think Isaac was probably pretty

00:25:57.979 --> 00:26:04.979
delighted as well. Amen? Can you imagine the process? Can you imagine as Isaac had been

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:16.779
bound and laying upon the altar and God has the angel call out in verse number 11 and

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.139
Abraham as he's got his hands stretched forth ready to slay his son in obedience to what

00:26:21.339 --> 00:26:26.699
God has told him to do, that he then hears the voice of God speaking to him and then

00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:31.259
he sees that ram that's caught in a thicket and all of a sudden now we're going to unloose

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:38.259
Isaac and bring Isaac off of that altar. We're going to put that ram upon that altar. The

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:45.820
provision of God. Abraham passed the test. The reality is that I believe that at times

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:53.820
in our lives we think that we would be willing to give up anything for God. Perhaps we'd

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:03.059
even stand and testify of our willingness to go and do whatever it is that He would

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:08.699
call us to do. Perhaps it's that we'd be willing to stand and say, I'd be willing to die for

00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:15.699
Christ. Can I remind you of Peter? Did he not say that he was willing to die for Christ?

00:27:16.179 --> 00:27:23.179
And what did Jesus say to Peter? Before the cock crow twice, you're going to deny me thrice.

00:27:24.339 --> 00:27:29.500
Sometimes we think that we'd be willing to offer and sacrifice and yield a whole lot

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.419
more than we actually would be. As we look at a passage of scripture like this, man,

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:41.419
the conviction is deep for me to think about the level at which the sacrifice is made and

00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:49.419
the obedience. Obeying no matter the cost. The Bible then records for us the confirmation,

00:27:56.419 --> 00:28:00.859
really the reconfirmation in verses 15 through 18 of the Abrahamic Covenant. The Bible says

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:04.579
the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said, By

00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:09.859
myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:13.779
thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply

00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:18.539
thy seed as the stars of the heaven, as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:22.500
shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:29.500
be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. They return and go to Beersheba according

00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:35.419
to verse 19. It says, So Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went

00:28:35.419 --> 00:28:40.940
together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. Verses 20 through 24 are given

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.260
to us almost as an addendum, if you will, to this passage of Scripture. And I believe

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:51.460
the main point of verses 20 through 24 is to introduce to us into the narrative of the

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:57.779
record of Genesis, Rebecca, who of course would be the wife of Isaac, as we'll get

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:01.179
to here in just a little while as we continue studying through the book of Genesis. But

00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:05.020
you notice in verse 20, it says that it came to pass after these things that it was told

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:09.979
Abraham saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor, Huz,

00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:16.979
his firstborn, and Buz, his brother, and Chemuel, the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.580
Pildash, and Jitlaph, and Bethuel. And Bethuel begat Rebecca. These eight, Milcah, did bear

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.859
to Nahor, Abraham's brother and his concubine, whose name was Reuma. She bare also Teba and

00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:35.580
Gaham and Tehash and Mekah. As you look at the introduction here, of course, to Rebecca

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:41.339
that is given to us in verse number 23 specifically, and of course as we continue reading in chapter

00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:46.539
number 24, we'll read of the marriage of Isaac and just how God had directed the servant

00:29:46.539 --> 00:29:51.320
of Abraham and so on and so forth, but we find that these verses are provided to us

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:57.299
in the narrative to introduce Rebecca. Now, as we kind of finish up this evening, we've

00:29:57.299 --> 00:30:00.299
noted the test and testimony of Abraham. I want you to see the

00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:02.899
the type of Christ that is given to us.

00:30:02.899 --> 00:30:05.179
It's a type that is provided.

00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:06.779
Oftentimes throughout the scriptures,

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:08.579
you see these pictures or these types,

00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:11.299
the typologies that God would provide.

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:14.779
And what a tremendous type is provided to us here

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:18.819
of the picture of the reality that one day,

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:21.859
the Lord Jesus Christ would go to the cross of Calvary

00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:23.859
to pay for the sin of mankind.

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:26.379
Now we understand looking at this perspective

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:28.179
and from this side of history,

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:30.539
that this has already taken place.

00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:34.659
But in Genesis 22, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:39.539
was way in the distance from a timeline perspective,

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:41.739
but yet we find there's a beautiful picture

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.819
that is provided here for us.

00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:48.539
In 1 Peter 1, we note that the Bible says this,

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:51.659
with regard to the coming of Christ

00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:54.339
and the purpose of his coming,

00:30:54.339 --> 00:30:56.659
of course, God created all things

00:30:56.659 --> 00:30:58.379
as we've studied in the book of Genesis,

00:30:58.379 --> 00:30:59.899
and we understand that he created Adam

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:02.179
and Eve in a perfect environment,

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:05.219
but the enemy, Satan, the serpent,

00:31:05.219 --> 00:31:08.219
who is more subtle than any beast of the field,

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:10.499
came and tempted, and we find that sin

00:31:10.499 --> 00:31:13.139
entered into the world in Genesis 3,

00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:17.259
and we understand the effects and consequences of that sin,

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:21.139
but we are mindful of the fact that God tells us

00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:24.139
in 1 Peter 1, in verses 18 through 20,

00:31:24.139 --> 00:31:25.619
notice what the Bible says,

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:29.259
for as much as you know that you are not redeemed

00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:31.939
with corruptible things as silver and gold

00:31:31.939 --> 00:31:34.979
from your vain conversation received by tradition

00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:36.419
from your fathers,

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:39.819
but with the precious blood of Christ

00:31:39.819 --> 00:31:42.659
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:46.019
notice verse 20, who verily was foreordained

00:31:46.019 --> 00:31:48.659
before the foundation of the world,

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:51.699
but was manifest in these last times for you

00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:54.059
who by him do believe in God

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:56.259
that raised him up from the dead

00:31:56.259 --> 00:31:59.579
and gave him glory that your faith and hope

00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:02.139
might be in God.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:04.939
I want you to understand that in Genesis 3,

00:32:04.939 --> 00:32:07.059
when sin entered into the world,

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:09.779
God was not in heaven wringing his hands

00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:11.619
and saying, now what are we gonna do?

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:17.699
Because God, in his omniscience and his eternality,

00:32:17.699 --> 00:32:20.339
he knew that though he had created man

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.219
in a perfect environment, in a perfect state,

00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:25.419
he knew that man would sin

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:28.939
and he had already made provision for the remedy.

00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:31.259
He had already made a way for man

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:34.659
to be reconciled to himself.

00:32:34.659 --> 00:32:36.979
And as we look at Genesis chapter number 22,

00:32:36.979 --> 00:32:40.059
we see this great picture, this great type

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:42.739
of when Christ would be offered on Calvary

00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:45.779
and we understand that that provision was already made,

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:47.419
but we understand as we look here

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:48.779
at the passage of Scripture

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:50.619
and kind of rehearse some of the things

00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:52.779
that we've already looked at where the Bible says,

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:54.619
take now thy son, in verse number two,

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:57.019
thine only son, whom thou lovest.

00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:58.779
You know, it's interesting,

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:00.579
the Bible tells us that God is love

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:02.779
and we see many things about love

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:04.139
throughout the word of God,

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:06.339
but if you were to read the gospel accounts

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:08.659
in Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

00:33:08.659 --> 00:33:11.499
you will find that the first time the word love

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:13.499
is mentioned in each of the gospels,

00:33:13.499 --> 00:33:14.859
Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:18.299
is at the time of the baptism of Jesus

00:33:18.299 --> 00:33:20.179
when God the Father says,

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:23.619
this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:28.419
So God the Father speaking of His love for the Son,

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.979
Matthew chapter number three in verse 17,

00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.979
Mark one in verse number 11,

00:33:32.979 --> 00:33:35.739
Luke three in verse number 22.

00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:38.499
But it's interesting when you come to the book of John,

00:33:38.499 --> 00:33:40.979
the first reference that you have to the word love

00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:44.179
in the book of John is that verse of Scripture

00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:46.259
that is so familiar to us,

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:49.739
for God so loved the world.

00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:54.899
That He gave His only begotten Son.

00:33:56.099 --> 00:33:57.699
The one that He loved.

00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:59.379
The one that He says in Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

00:33:59.379 --> 00:34:02.339
this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:04.779
For God so loved the world

00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:06.419
that He gave His only begotten Son

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:08.379
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.899
but have everlasting life.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.819
The love that God has,

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:15.619
the Father has for His Son,

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:18.299
but the love that God has for us.

00:34:18.299 --> 00:34:20.859
The love that He has for His creation

00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:22.220
and through that love,

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.859
we find that He was willing to pay for the sin of mankind.

00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:27.779
I would say this,

00:34:27.779 --> 00:34:30.859
it was the only payment that could be acceptable.

00:34:30.859 --> 00:34:34.099
It required that God and the person of Jesus Christ

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:37.379
die in the place of us, of mankind.

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:40.259
We notice the Bible says in verse number four

00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:42.739
that on that third day Abraham lifted up his eyes

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.940
and saw the place afar off.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.019
It's interesting if you were to look at Luke 23

00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:48.379
and verse number 33,

00:34:48.379 --> 00:34:50.579
it talks about seeing the place

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.659
where Christ would be crucified.

00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:57.299
And if you take and you go to the Gospel records

00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:00.099
of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:02.419
and you understand what takes place,

00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:05.259
we find that here as we look at this picture

00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:07.099
in Genesis chapter number 22,

00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:10.059
we find the Bible says that there was a ram

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:13.099
that was provided that was caught in a thicket by his horns

00:35:13.099 --> 00:35:14.419
in verse number 13,

00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:17.699
and that Abraham was able to offer that ram

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:18.819
in the stead of his son.

00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:21.059
But I want you to understand that Jesus Christ,

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:22.419
the God in flesh,

00:35:22.419 --> 00:35:24.899
He went all the way to the cross of Calvary

00:35:24.899 --> 00:35:26.619
and He shed His precious blood

00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:31.619
and He died a horrific death for us.

00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:33.259
For us.

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:37.059
Because He loved us so much.

00:35:37.059 --> 00:35:38.619
And I would say this,

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:40.940
it was in my place, right?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.519
It was in your place.

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:46.599
The ram was sacrificed in the place of Isaac,

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:50.639
but the Son of God was sacrificed in my place.

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:54.119
It was my death that I should have died.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:56.359
It was your death that you should have died.

00:35:56.359 --> 00:35:59.919
It was our cross that we deserve.

00:36:01.399 --> 00:36:02.679
Correct?

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:03.839
That's what we deserve.

00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:10.539
A healthy dose of Bible would help our society by the way.

00:36:10.539 --> 00:36:11.379
Amen?

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:14.699
But the reality is that there are times

00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:16.379
in which we look at this and we see,

00:36:16.379 --> 00:36:18.940
and we notice this type here and we say,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.940
aren't you so glad that Jesus was willing to pay it all?

00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:25.539
Right?

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:29.139
We sing songs about what He did for us

00:36:29.139 --> 00:36:31.819
and how He gave it all.

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:34.859
He went the whole distance.

00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:40.699
Peter tried to rebuke Him, correct?

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.179
Satan, no doubt in my mind,

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.299
many times as you read the Gospel accounts,

00:36:49.299 --> 00:36:51.339
Satan tried to have Jesus killed

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:53.779
before He could ever get to the cross of Calvary.

00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:59.459
You read the Gospel accounts and you see many instances.

00:37:00.979 --> 00:37:02.659
If He would have died any other way,

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:04.599
it would not have fulfilled prophecy.

00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:08.319
He had to go to that cross.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.500
And I want you to understand from Hebrews

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.459
that He went to that cross willingly

00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:18.459
for the joy that was set before Him.

00:37:19.379 --> 00:37:20.220
What was that joy?

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.259
He knew He was paying for our sin.

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:26.099
He was able to say, it is finished.

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:29.859
I've paid for the sin of mankind.

00:37:30.859 --> 00:37:35.500
He cried out prior to that, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.940
my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.099
when the sin of the world was poured,

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:43.739
the wrath of God was poured upon God the Son.

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:45.859
He turned His back, it turned dark

00:37:45.859 --> 00:37:47.459
and all that took place,

00:37:47.459 --> 00:37:51.199
but we find that He was willing to do that,

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:52.739
the joy that was set before Him

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:55.579
so that we could be redeemed, we could be reconciled.

00:37:55.579 --> 00:37:56.399
Why?

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.299
Because there's no other way.

00:37:58.299 --> 00:37:59.459
There's no other way.

00:38:00.859 --> 00:38:05.859
Jesus paid it all and the songwriter said all to Him I owe.

00:38:09.379 --> 00:38:10.220
Right?

00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:13.339
I surrender all, we sing the song.

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:16.500
Someone told me a number of years ago

00:38:17.419 --> 00:38:20.940
that it was that actual song that convicted them deeply

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.259
for they had sat in church for years

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:26.419
and they had kind of played the part.

00:38:27.419 --> 00:38:32.259
And I remember singing one day, I surrender all.

00:38:32.259 --> 00:38:34.799
It was as if the Holy Spirit of God whispered to their ear

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:36.700
and said, no, you haven't.

00:38:40.019 --> 00:38:41.880
At best, you've surrendered some.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.859
This is that person's testimony.

00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:50.019
They told it to me in their living room.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.500
And it was at that moment, I've not been perfect

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.419
and I've not always surrendered all,

00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:59.779
was at that moment that it got real in my life to serve God.

00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:04.719
Because I understood that I could sing a song,

00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:06.739
but I could lie as I sang it.

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:10.820
Because they had not truly surrendered all.

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:13.979
I'm thankful that Christ went all the way.

00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:18.080
The people that mocked, as I mentioned last week

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.219
as we observed the Lord's Supper,

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:25.019
if you're who you say you are, come down.

00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:31.239
He saved others, but He can't save Himself.

00:39:32.779 --> 00:39:35.820
I'm thankful He didn't come off of that cross

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.539
until He had paid for the sin of mankind.

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:39.380
Aren't you?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.679
He could have called angels.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.779
I remember speaking to a young man

00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:47.500
when I was in high school, a senior in high school,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.159
and he said this to me.

00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:53.039
He said, you're telling me that Jesus loved me

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:53.959
and He died for me?

00:39:53.959 --> 00:39:54.919
He didn't have a choice.

00:39:54.919 --> 00:39:58.959
He was arrested and those soldiers took Him

00:39:58.959 --> 00:40:00.399
and he had no choice.

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:03.799
And I said, what you don't understand is that the Gospels tell us that He could have called

00:40:03.799 --> 00:40:13.119
legions of angels, but He didn't because it was love that took Him to that cross.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:16.279
I can't fully comprehend Genesis 22.

00:40:16.279 --> 00:40:18.639
I honestly can't.

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:23.479
The test and testimony of Abraham is phenomenal.

00:40:23.479 --> 00:40:27.979
It is absolutely convicting to me every time I read it.

00:40:27.979 --> 00:40:33.759
As I prepared for the message this week, understanding that this was the passage in which we deal

00:40:33.759 --> 00:40:41.699
with the conviction again of studying and considering the events of Genesis 22, it is

00:40:41.699 --> 00:40:51.719
a mountain peak in God's Word, only to be surpassed by the mount that Jesus died for

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:53.879
our sin.

00:40:53.879 --> 00:41:02.179
But I wonder how far up the mountain of Genesis 22 I have been willing to go.

00:41:02.179 --> 00:41:08.879
At what point in my life, and I'd ask you to ask yourself the same questions, that I've

00:41:08.879 --> 00:41:16.839
said this is kind of as far as I'm going to go, this is as much as I'm willing to surrender,

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:23.759
this is as far as I'm willing to make sacrifice, or are we just really all in?

00:41:23.759 --> 00:41:25.439
I'm yours.

00:41:25.439 --> 00:41:28.179
I'm going to present my body a living sacrifice.

00:41:28.179 --> 00:41:32.359
Can we truly say, here am I, Lord, send me?

00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:37.739
And if God says, I want you to go to, you just fill in a country.

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:45.959
Are we willing to quit our jobs and leave everything that America has given us and say,

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:48.919
I'm following Jesus?

00:41:48.919 --> 00:41:53.479
Because I'm willing to surrender all.

00:41:54.199 --> 00:42:00.839
I believe that the testimony of Abraham is easily summarized by two phrases, faith and

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:04.559
obedience, surrender and sacrifice.

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:07.919
Oh, how much do we believe God?

00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:13.519
He believed that God could do something that had never been done, that God could raise

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:15.839
up His Son.

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:26.919
He obeyed God immediately, without hesitation, to do, in my mind, the unthinkable, the surrender

00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.359
and the sacrifice.

00:42:28.359 --> 00:42:33.799
Oh, I hope tonight that we're encouraged of the type, from this passage of Scripture,

00:42:33.799 --> 00:42:37.459
the picture of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:46.299
But I hope tonight that God would help us to really do some self-examination and say,

00:42:46.299 --> 00:42:48.379
how would I have responded?

00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:50.939
Or what is it in my life?

00:42:50.939 --> 00:42:54.579
What is it that God's putting His thumb on in my life?

00:42:54.579 --> 00:42:57.979
He's saying, are you willing to surrender this?

00:42:57.979 --> 00:43:04.459
What is it that you're unwilling to give up for me?

00:43:04.459 --> 00:43:11.379
And I tell you that there should be nothing in our lives that's more precious to us than

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:12.979
following Jesus.

00:43:12.979 --> 00:43:13.979
Amen?

00:43:13.979 --> 00:43:19.459
Honestly, nothing should be more precious to us than following Jesus.

00:43:19.459 --> 00:43:22.579
We sing, I'll go where you want me to go, I'll do what you want me to do.

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:24.739
I'm not suggesting that all of you should quit your jobs.

00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:28.939
In fact, it would make me afraid if you all quit your jobs.

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.179
But what I'm suggesting is that we just say, God, I'm Yours.

00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:32.179
What do You want me to do?

00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:33.219
What do You want me to do?

00:43:33.219 --> 00:43:35.139
Where do You want me to go?

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:37.099
The faith and obedience of Abraham.

00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:38.099
Let's pray.

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:42.499
Father, thank You for the passage.

00:43:42.499 --> 00:43:50.459
I'm not sure that I could ever do justice to explaining or seeking to give commentary

00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:54.299
on such a passage of Scripture.

00:43:54.299 --> 00:44:00.099
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God has used the Word of God tonight to speak to the hearts

00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:05.779
of Your people.

00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:16.099
I'm so thankful for the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:23.219
The type, the picture that we see here in Genesis 22 of that event that has now passed

00:44:23.219 --> 00:44:25.299
historically.

00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:33.019
The time of this event was in the far distant future, but I rest my attention upon Abraham

00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:39.019
tonight, his faith, his obedience, his surrender, his sacrifice.

00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:47.859
God, I pray that You'd work in my heart and our lives collectively, individually.

00:44:47.859 --> 00:44:51.499
Help us to surrender all.

00:44:51.499 --> 00:44:57.619
Help us to be willing to give up whatever it is that You would require of us to give

00:44:57.619 --> 00:45:08.379
up from our human perspective in the pursuit of Your perfect will for our lives.

00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:10.299
We ask that You'd move and work as only You can.

00:45:10.299 --> 00:45:11.579
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:11.859
Would You stand with us?
