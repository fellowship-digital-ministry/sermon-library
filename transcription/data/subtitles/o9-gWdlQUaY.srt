1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,319
after number three i'm not sure when the food's going to be here

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,519
uh... but i know one thing that's a blessing is when you have lunch on the

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,039
property after the service you have a little bit of liberty to preach a little

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,119
longer

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,279
and when you haven't reached in as long as i haven't reached then you take that

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,920
liberty if you will

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,479
uh... i got four points this morning and so we'll get through it but uh... lunch

8
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,079
is going to be provided here on the property

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,360
and so i trust that you will pay attention throughout the end of the

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,760
entirety of the message i trust to be a blessing to you

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,200
first samuel chapter three is a a familiar passage of scripture here in the

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,000
beginning

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,159
of the book of first samuel of course we know that the lord graciously answered

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,479
the prayer of hannah

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,240
we read about the first chapter of uh... in first samuel chapter one we read

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,799
about the life of hannah

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,880
and of course her husband el cana and the bible tells us that hannah

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,680
was barren

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,000
she had no children

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,200
we find that though she was barren she earnestly sought the lord

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,479
and i'll say this she plainly made a request she asked for a son she's very

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,279
plain in her request to the lord

23
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:08,000
and uh... we find that as we study the whole of scripture the bible says ask

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,480
and you shall receive

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,440
and uh... you have not because you ask not you have not because you ask amiss

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,839
and

27
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:19,000
we understand some of those truths with regard to prayer but we find that hannah

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,599
very plainly seeks the lord and prays earnestly

29
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,000
for a son

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,839
god answers her prayer

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,680
and we know that the result of that answer is the birth of samuel and we

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
know that

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,080
uh... the name samuel in fact hannah states this in first samuel one in verse

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,199
number twenty

35
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:43,680
uh... the reason why she named him samuel because i have asked him

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,559
of the lord

37
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,239
you may remember that as hannah prayed

38
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,580
for a son that her prayer also included a promise

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,559
a vow if you will that she would give him unto the lord

40
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,279
all the days of his life

41
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,099
i'm thankful to report that

42
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,639
god answered the prayer of hannah

43
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,800
and hannah

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,380
she fulfilled the vow that she made to god

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,800
and samuel ministered in shiloh with eli and we find that the

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,160
word of god will tell us as we begin first samuel chapter number three

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,399
uh... the first several verses give us really a setting for our message this

48
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,220
morning

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,960
notice the bible says this in first samuel three in verse number one

50
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,779
and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli

51
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,279
the word of the lord was precious

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,240
in those days

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,039
notice what the bible says there was no

54
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,460
open vision

55
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,320
you're familiar with that truth in proverbs twenty nine in verse eighteen

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,080
where there's no vision

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,800
the people perish

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
and that's not speaking about having a vision for a

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,360
a land or a people or so on and so forth that's regarding

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,119
the giving of god's word we understand all scripture is given by inspiration

61
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,000
of god

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,559
the bible says that the word of god was precious in those days

63
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:06,800
there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,119
when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim

65
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,119
that he could not see

66
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:18,399
and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord

67
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,639
where the ark of god was

68
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,259
and samuel was laid down

69
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,300
to sleep

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,699
we find several things here in the first three verses of first samuel chapter

71
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,500
one

72
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,899
we find that samuel was serving god it says that he ministered unto the lord

73
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:35,619
before eli in verse number one we know that the

74
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:38,720
uh... scriptures tell us as i mentioned in verse number one that there was no

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,320
open vision that the word of god was precious in those days

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,339
the bible also tells us that eli was going blind he could not see

77
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:50,139
according to the end of verse number two

78
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,500
and the bible tells us something interesting in verse number three

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,740
that the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord you know that was to

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,139
burn continually

81
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,699
the responsibility of the priest were to ensure that the oil was

82
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,860
put into those lamps so that they would burn continually

83
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,779
and we find the bible says that the lamp of god went out in the temple of the

84
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,860
lord where the ark of god was

85
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,820
and the bible tells us now that samuel

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,760
he went to sleep

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,799
and what a setting that god gives us for our text this morning

88
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,519
we focusing primarily on verses four through eleven you see in your bulletin

89
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,399
this morning

90
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,279
that the title of the message and really this is the short title is speak

91
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,540
the full title if you want the full title would be

92
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,359
as we find in verse number nine

93
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,600
speak lord

94
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,079
for thy servant

95
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,380
speak

96
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,679
lord

97
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:50,119
for thy servant

98
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,980
notice this morning if you're taking notes i want you to know the persistence

99
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,559
of the lord

100
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,959
in verses four through eight

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,959
god gives us the record

102
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,000
of his calling to his servant samuel

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,760
we would find as i've noted this morning the persistence of the lord

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,160
and we find that the lord desires to speak to samuel i'm thankful this

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,279
morning to report that god still desires to speak to his children

106
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,839
that god desires to speak to you

107
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,880
and to speak to me in fact if you've read your bible this morning already

108
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,799
uh... the lord spoke to you through his word i was

109
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,839
finishing up in reading this morning

110
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,880
in the book of nehemiah and reading the the truth of god's word

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,600
and how the lord minister to my heart personally several hours ago as i was

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,079
reading that portion of scripture and i'm thankful this morning

113
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,480
uh... for the persistence of god in the life of samuel notices we

114
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,200
understand the setting

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,440
uh... that that eli he's going blind he cannot see

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,519
uh... he's elderly we find that samuel was ministering before the lord

117
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,920
and we find that samuel goes to sleep and the bible says in verse number four

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,179
that the lord called samuel

119
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,000
the lord called samuel

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,320
and he answered samuel answered and said here am i and notice what he does

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,200
he ran unto eli and said

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,279
here am i

123
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,079
for thou callest me

124
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,559
this is a natural response i mean if you would understand the

125
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,600
the setting and all that was taking place and you consider the

126
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,200
uh... the frailty of eli and you consider the

127
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
the responsibility in the ministry of samuel and you find that samuel hears

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
his voice called

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,000
samuel what is the natural thing for him to do is to run to eli to say here am i

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,480
you've called me

131
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
and eli says

132
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
i didn't call you

133
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,200
notice in verse number five and he said

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,799
i called not

135
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,480
lie down again

136
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,739
and he went

137
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,320
and lay down

138
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,839
but verse number six says this notice the phrase in verse number four that the

139
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,119
lord called samuel in verse number six

140
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,200
and the lord called

141
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,399
yet

142
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,660
again

143
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,640
the persistence of god

144
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,399
the bible says he called yet again samuel

145
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,399
and samuel arose and went to eli

146
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,600
notice what he says here am i

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
for thou didst call me

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,920
and he answered i called not my son

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,079
lie down again

150
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,320
now at this point i'm not sure exactly all of the side story of what's going on

151
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,279
and uh... the the mind of samuel the mind of eli

152
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,399
uh... but i can imagine samuel as he

153
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,720
rose up that second time and he knows that he heard his name called and

154
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,119
he runs into where eli is and he says

155
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,839
you've called me

156
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,959
here am i he says i didn't call you

157
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,279
and samuel probably thinks he's going crazy right like what's going on

158
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,079
uh... i know that i heard my name called

159
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,119
he says lie down again at the end of verse number six that's eli's instruction

160
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,959
to samuel

161
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,279
the bible tells us in verse number seven now samuel did not yet know the lord

162
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,160
neither was the word of the lord yet revealed

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,320
unto him

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,459
again we see the persistence of the lord in verse number eight

165
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:07,880
the bible says the lord called samuel again

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,359
the third time

167
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,640
he arose and went to eli and said here am i

168
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,079
for thou didst call me

169
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,799
now i wonder again

170
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,760
uh... it may be the the

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,959
uh... tone of samuel of

172
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,279
trying to convince eli i know that you've called me

173
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,040
but now as we look at this text of scripture and we find uh...

174
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,119
the persistence of god and the

175
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:36,080
the way in which he desires to speak to his servant we read again in verse

176
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
number ten

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,679
in the uh... the first phrase this is the lord came and stood

178
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,960
and called as at other times

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,000
samuel

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,299
aren't you thankful for the persistence of god

181
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,599
the fact that he desires to speak to us we

182
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:59,200
have his word and we would say this morning that we have the complete canon

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,919
of scripture we have all that god desires for us to have been

184
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,599
in this book we find

185
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:08,000
the answers to the problems that we would face in life and

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,479
we find that it's in this book that we

187
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:15,140
uh... have the opportunity to hear the voice of god

188
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,200
what a blessing it is that god desires to speak to us and

189
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,359
we find that

190
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,960
uh... it is true this morning that we

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,119
we read many things

192
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,760
we listen to many things

193
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,280
but i wonder this morning how much time do we spend reading this book

194
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,320
how much time do we spend in the word of god

195
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,239
i have a library full of books i'm not suggesting this morning

196
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,559
that you should not read

197
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,880
uh... any other book but the reality

198
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,960
is that this book is a precious book it is a profitable book

199
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,719
and it is certainly important that we spend time in the word of god

200
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:54,520
so many people uh... they they desire to i want to be a good husband will read

201
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,919
the word of god because god is the one that created the home

202
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,320
god is the one that gives the instructions on

203
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,820
and how to be a good husband.

204
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,120
I want to be a good wife.

205
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
Then go to the Word of God

206
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,680
and find out what God says

207
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,960
about being a good wife.

208
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,400
I want to be a good father,

209
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,960
a good mother, a good son,

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
a good daughter,

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
a good church member,

212
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
a good pastor.

213
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,280
The Word of God has all of that in it.

214
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,240
And what a blessing that God desires

215
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,200
to speak to us.

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,120
Sometimes we'll spend more time

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,880
reading a self-help book,

218
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,320
reading a leadership book

219
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,720
from some human penman,

220
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,680
reading some book on parenting

221
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,280
from someone that has written that book.

222
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Again, I'm not suggesting

223
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
that those aren't good resources,

224
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,320
but we must read this book.

225
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
And we must recognize this morning

226
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,120
that God desires to speak to you.

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
I understand that He speaks to us

228
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,920
through His Word.

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
And I understand that He may not be

230
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
calling us this morning

231
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,280
in the same fashion in which He called Samuel.

232
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Here it's recorded in 1 Samuel 3.

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
But I wonder this morning,

234
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,520
are there times in your life

235
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,760
in which perhaps you've had a season,

236
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
a dry season if you will,

237
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
where you've not spent time

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
in the Word of God on a daily basis?

239
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,200
And the Holy Spirit of God,

240
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
He's calling you

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,520
and He's giving you that thirst

242
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,000
and that desire for the Word of God.

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,520
Perhaps there's a time in which

244
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,960
you've not been able to attend church regularly.

245
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
You've not had the opportunity

246
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
to sit under the preaching

247
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
of the Word of God

248
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
and you have a longing

249
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
and you have a desire

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,840
to hear the Word of God.

251
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,640
To hear the voice of God.

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,520
We find the persistence of the Lord.

253
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm so thankful that as we look

254
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
at 1 Samuel 3,

255
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,960
that the Lord was persistent

256
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,760
in His calling of Samuel.

257
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Notice not only the persistence of the Lord,

258
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,440
2, notice the perception of Eli.

259
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,200
In verse 8, we find that it was the third time

260
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,920
in which the Lord called Samuel

261
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,440
and Samuel arises and goes to Eli

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,840
and says, here am I for thou didst call me.

263
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
And you notice the end of v. 8,

264
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
the Bible says,

265
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,240
and Eli perceived that the Lord

266
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,760
had called the child.

267
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm thankful for the perception of Eli.

268
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm thankful that as we would look

269
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,560
at this text of Scripture

270
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,480
and we'd understand what's taking place

271
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,360
and we'd understand the role of Eli

272
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,520
and the call that God is giving to Samuel,

273
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,760
that Eli, of course, Samuel goes to him

274
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,640
each time assuming that it was Eli

275
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,480
that was calling.

276
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
There was some need that Eli had.

277
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,840
There was something that had happened

278
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,560
and Eli needed the assistance of Samuel.

279
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
Thus, Samuel would run to Eli,

280
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
but that's not what was taking place.

281
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,720
It was the Lord who was calling Samuel.

282
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
And the perception of Eli

283
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,760
is given to us here in v. 8.

284
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,480
It says that he perceived

285
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
that the Lord had called the child.

286
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,920
Now I know the perception of Eli,

287
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,520
but I want you to understand

288
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,480
that Eli then gave good counsel.

289
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm thankful for the counsel that Eli gives.

290
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,920
In v. 9 of our text of Scripture,

291
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,400
after Eli perceived that it was the Lord

292
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
that called Samuel,

293
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,720
he then gives some instruction,

294
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,520
some counsel, if you will, to Samuel.

295
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,360
And he says this,

296
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,080
Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,

297
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Go, lie down.

298
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Now he had already told Samuel that

299
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,640
on a couple of occasions, had he not?

300
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,480
He had told him in v. 5,

301
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,880
he says lie down again.

302
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,360
Again in v. 6, lie down again.

303
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,560
But now when Eli perceived

304
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,880
that it was the Lord that called the child,

305
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,400
the instruction, the counsel

306
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,600
that Eli will give Samuel changes.

307
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,960
It's not simply go lie down.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,880
But notice the Bible tells us in v. 9,

309
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,640
Go lie down, and it shall be,

310
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,360
if he call thee, that thou shalt say,

311
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

312
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,120
So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

313
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,920
As we think about the perception of Eli,

314
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
and we think about the counsel of Eli,

315
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,040
what great counsel that he gives to Samuel.

316
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,600
He tells Samuel to hear the voice calling him,

317
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Samuel, Samuel, and if he shall call thee again,

318
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,200
here's what you need to say.

319
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,920
Don't come running to me,

320
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm not the one calling you,

321
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,800
but say, Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

322
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,080
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

323
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,360
The Bible tells us that Samuel went and lay down

324
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,240
in his place.

325
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,640
We've noted already in v. 10,

326
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,040
that the persistence of the Lord is recorded for us

327
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
where the Bible says that the Lord came

328
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,200
and stood and called as at other times,

329
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,320
Samuel, Samuel.

330
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,300
We note the persistence of God.

331
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,760
We note the perception of Eli.

332
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,980
But now I want you to note the posture of God's servant.

333
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,040
The posture, the attitude, the position, if you will,

334
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,760
of the servant of the Lord, that being Samuel.

335
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,279
Notice the Bible tells us that the Lord came

336
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
and called us at other times and said,

337
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
Samuel, Samuel.

338
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,640
And notice in v. 10, the last phrase of the verse,

339
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,640
then Samuel answered, Speak, for thy servant heareth.

340
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm so thankful for the response of Samuel

341
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,240
in this passage of Scripture

342
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,760
that he took heed to the counsel that he received from Eli.

343
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,520
And of course, as we note that God calls again

344
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,240
and says, Samuel, Samuel,

345
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,899
and we find the posture of God's servant,

346
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,399
and we understand that here in the text of Scripture,

347
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,279
it helps us to understand the relationship, if you will,

348
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,279
that he indeed is Lord and we are his servants.

349
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,640
You know, it's a tremendous blessing

350
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,240
that he would speak to us.

351
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,160
It really is.

352
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,700
You know, there are some people in our world today

353
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,880
that are motivational speakers,

354
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,279
that make lots of money giving speeches,

355
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,399
and people pay lots of money to go listen to somebody talk

356
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,520
on some subject and so on and so forth,

357
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,059
and they desire to hear the words of this individual.

358
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,480
We could think of Solomon and all of his wisdom

359
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,520
and the way in which the Queen of Sheba traveled

360
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,880
to hear the wisdom of Solomon,

361
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,559
and we can understand those things,

362
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,399
but you understand that the omniscient, all-knowing God

363
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,399
has given us a book, and he desires to speak to us.

364
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,480
And our posture should be one of speak, Lord,

365
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
for thy servant heareth.

366
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
We should have that desire to hear the voice of God

367
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,399
as we read the pages of Scripture

368
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,520
to understand that it's God's Word.

369
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,760
And he desires to speak to us.

370
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,559
This word heareth, when the Bible says speak,

371
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,679
for thy servant heareth,

372
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,960
that word carries with it the idea of hearing, listening,

373
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,240
but also with the purpose of obedience,

374
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,679
the idea of hearing with a view of obeying.

375
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,240
Now that's a good understanding of us

376
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,660
as we dig in and understand really

377
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,440
what Samuel is saying here.

378
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,440
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

379
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
I wonder this morning when we go to the Word of God,

380
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
when we come to the house of God,

381
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,320
when we are listening and reading the Bible ourselves,

382
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,440
when we're hearing the preaching of the Word of God,

383
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,440
are we saying speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth?

384
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,339
This hearing that is focused on,

385
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,559
that has the view of obedience,

386
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,580
that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

387
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm mindful of the truth that we find

388
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,920
within the Word of God where David will say in Psalm 86

389
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,440
and verse number 11 as he's praying,

390
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,000
and what a great psalm of prayer.

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,320
He says, teach me thy way, O Lord.

392
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,880
I will walk in thy truth.

393
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,820
That's the desire to hear the teaching of the Word of God,

394
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,800
to hear the words of God with a purpose of obedience,

395
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,119
with a mind of walking in thy truth.

396
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,720
I want you to note Psalm 119, if you will.

397
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,440
What a wonderful passage of Scripture, Psalm 119.

398
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
If you turn over to that passage, if you will,

399
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,239
hold your place there in 1 Samuel 3.

400
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,559
Of course, we're familiar with Psalm 119,

401
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,960
the longest chapter in all of the Bible,

402
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,520
a text of Scripture that is dedicated

403
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,220
to the very Word of God.

404
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,419
And I want you to know how the psalm begins

405
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,880
in verse number one.

406
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,419
Blessed are the undefiled in the way,

407
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,100
notice this, who walk in the way of the Lord.

408
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,979
Who walk in the way of the Lord.

409
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:04,220
The idea of hearing the Word of God

410
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,900
with the purpose of obedience.

411
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,739
Why is it that we would say, speak, Lord,

412
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,020
for thy servant heareth.

413
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,679
I want to hear God speak,

414
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,260
and I purpose to obey what God says.

415
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,820
We find here that as we would consider

416
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,900
the truth of God's Word,

417
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,380
and the focus of these two psalms,

418
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,900
and of course we could look at a number of truths

419
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,020
this morning, but I want you to think in your mind,

420
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,900
you don't need to turn there,

421
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
but in Luke chapter number 10,

422
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,640
God records for us an event in the life

423
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,760
of the Lord Jesus Christ when He's at the house

424
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,880
of Mary and Martha, and we find the Bible says

425
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,880
that Mary, that she was also sat at Jesus' feet

426
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,640
and heard His Word.

427
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,059
And heard His Word.

428
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,600
The idea, again, of that particular Word

429
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
there in Luke 10 and verse number 39.

430
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,860
of heard or hear is to attend to,

431
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,900
to consider what is or has been said

432
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,020
to understand.

433
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,560
She sat at the feet of Jesus

434
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,920
and heard His Word.

435
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,760
I note back in 1 Samuel 3,

436
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,160
as we take note of the posture

437
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,260
of God's servant,

438
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,360
and I note the end of v. 10,

439
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,160
he says,

440
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,120
Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

441
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,420
And then I want you to notice

442
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,040
the first few words of v. 11.

443
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,000
And the Lord said...

444
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,120
And the Lord said...

445
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,480
Isn't that sweet?

446
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,920
I mean, the first three times,

447
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,000
Samuel does not know that it's God

448
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,840
that's calling him to speak to him

449
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
and he runs to Eli.

450
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
And Eli says, I've called thee not.

451
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,380
On that third encounter,

452
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,240
Eli perceives that it was the Lord

453
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,600
that called Samuel.

454
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,020
And he says, when you hear his voice again,

455
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,380
if he were to call to you again,

456
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,120
say, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

457
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,880
And Samuel goes back to his place

458
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,720
and Samuel hears again,

459
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
Samuel! Samuel!

460
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
And he responds by saying,

461
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Speak, for Thy servant heareth.

462
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
And the Bible says,

463
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,200
the Lord said to Samuel.

464
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,560
Wow!

465
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Sometimes we say, well,

466
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,880
He's just not talking to me.

467
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,840
Are we saying, Speak, Lord,

468
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,040
for Thy servant heareth?

469
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
Are we responding?

470
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,720
Are we entering our time

471
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,360
in the Word of God

472
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,760
by saying, Lord, I want You to speak to my heart.

473
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,840
I want You to teach me Thy truth.

474
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,800
I commit, I resolve to walk in Thy ways.

475
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,160
Lord, show me things that I need to do.

476
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,040
Show me things I need to stop doing.

477
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:03,160
Lord, speak, for Thy servant heareth.

478
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,000
I want you to note that this is first of many times

479
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,400
for Samuel when he heard the voice of God.

480
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
When God spoke to him.

481
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,400
We won't have time to go through all of them,

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
but I want you to quickly go through several chapters

483
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
here in 1 Samuel with me.

484
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,920
And I want to just note some of these verses of Scripture

485
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,000
in which God speaks to Samuel.

486
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,240
We notice in verse number 11,

487
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400
the Lord said to Samuel.

488
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Notice in verse number 19,

489
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
the Bible says, and Samuel grew,

490
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,440
and the Lord was with him

491
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,040
and did let none of his words fail to the ground,

492
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,880
fall to the ground.

493
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,040
Excuse me, verse number 21,

494
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,240
and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh,

495
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,200
for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh

496
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,680
by the Word of the Lord.

497
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,840
Let's move over to chapter number 8, if you will.

498
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,560
Of course, we're familiar with the text of Scripture

499
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,520
in verse number 8,

500
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,040
where the people of God wanted a king.

501
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,080
And the Bible tells us that the thing displeased Samuel,

502
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,600
but in verse number 7 of 1 Samuel 8,

503
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,840
the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Samuel.

504
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,480
God's speaking to Samuel.

505
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,200
God's giving Samuel truth.

506
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
God is revealing to Samuel what is taking place.

507
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,600
He says, hearken unto the voice of the people

508
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,240
and all that they say unto thee,

509
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
for they have not rejected thee,

510
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,200
but they have rejected me,

511
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,800
that I should not reign over them.

512
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,880
Notice in chapter number 9.

513
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,440
In verse number 15, this is very interesting.

514
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,600
This is when Saul is coming,

515
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,480
and they're going to go to the man of God, to Samuel.

516
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,240
And the Bible says in verse number 15,

517
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,080
now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear

518
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,000
a day before Saul came, saying,

519
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,080
notice what God tells him,

520
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,040
the day before Saul comes,

521
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,000
tomorrow, about this time,

522
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,560
I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin,

523
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,440
and thou shalt anoint him to be captain

524
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
over my people Israel,

525
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,200
that he may save my people

526
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,080
out of the hand of the Philistines.

527
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
For I have looked upon my people

528
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
because their cry is coming to me.

529
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,000
And when Samuel saw, notice,

530
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,480
the Lord said unto him,

531
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,640
behold, the man whom I spake to thee of,

532
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,240
this same shall reign over my people.

533
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,760
The day before Saul even arrives,

534
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,480
God speaks in the ear of Samuel

535
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,400
and tells him that Saul's going to come,

536
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,200
and that he is to anoint this one to be king over Israel.

537
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,800
Notice in chapter number 15,

538
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,760
just picking a few here,

539
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,520
where the Bible tells us that the Lord spoke to Samuel

540
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,680
in chapter number 15,

541
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,559
the partial obedience of Saul

542
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,760
with the situation there with the Amalekites,

543
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
and the Bible tells us in verse number 10,

544
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,559
then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying,

545
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,520
and God's going to give Samuel some truth

546
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,600
with regard to the rejection of Saul

547
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,960
being king over Israel.

548
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,800
You find in chapter number 16,

549
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,880
that the Lord said unto Samuel,

550
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,120
how long wilt thou mourn for Saul?

551
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,480
Seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel,

552
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,600
fill thine horn with oil,

553
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,760
and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite,

554
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,720
for I have provided me a king among his sons.

555
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Of course, the Bible as you're familiar with,

556
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
the passage of Scripture in verse number six,

557
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,800
that the sons of Jesse are to come,

558
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,040
and he looks upon Eliab and said,

559
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,600
surely the Lord's anointed is before me.

560
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,760
But notice verse number seven,

561
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,800
but the Lord said unto Samuel.

562
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,840
Aren't you thankful that God spoke to Samuel?

563
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,240
Because when he sees Eliab,

564
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,880
he says, surely this is the one.

565
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,440
But God spoke to Samuel.

566
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,120
And God said to Samuel, this isn't him.

567
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,760
He says, look not on his countenance

568
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,040
or on the height of his stature,

569
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,600
because I have refused him.

570
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,279
For the Lord seeth not as man seeth,

571
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,840
for man looketh on the outward appearance,

572
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,200
but the Lord looketh on the heart.

573
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,320
One by one, the sons of Jesse pass by.

574
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,440
And God says, no, no, no.

575
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,880
Aren't you thankful that God spoke to Samuel?

576
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,279
Aren't you thankful that Samuel learned to say,

577
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,760
speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

578
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,200
The Bible tells us that they come to a place

579
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
and the Lord hath not chosen any of these,

580
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
and He asks the question to Jesse,

581
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,279
are here all thy children?

582
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
And He tells them that David the youngest,

583
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,240
of course, He doesn't even give his name

584
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,800
in verse number 11, but He says,

585
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,240
there remaineth yet the youngest,

586
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,720
and behold, he keepeth the sheep.

587
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Then the Bible says in verse number 12,

588
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
as David appears, it says,

589
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
and he sent and brought him in,

590
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,840
and now he was ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance

591
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,520
and goodly to look to,

592
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,640
and notice this phrase, and the Lord said,

593
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,640
and the Lord said, arise, anoint him, for this is he.

594
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
Then I want you to notice the response.

595
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,480
Remember, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

596
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,000
The word hereth carries with it that idea

597
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,080
of hearing with a view of obeying.

598
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,920
Samuel had this consistency.

599
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,720
When God spoke to him in chapter number nine

600
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,279
and said, hey, Saul's gonna come

601
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,400
and I want you to anoint him, did he?

602
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
He did.

603
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,600
He obeyed the Lord.

604
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,520
And here, in chapter number 16,

605
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,600
we notice the Bible says that the Lord said,

606
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,920
arise, anoint him, for this is he.

607
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Then, verse number 13, Samuel took the horn of oil

608
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,960
and anointed him in the midst of his brethren.

609
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,480
The Spirit of the Lord came upon David

610
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
from that day forward.

611
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,640
So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.

612
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,960
I've taken this few minutes to look

613
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
through these verses of Scripture

614
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,400
to see that here in chapter number three

615
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,600
was the first of many times in the life of Samuel

616
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,040
when the Lord spoke to him.

617
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,559
And I want you to consider with me

618
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,520
as we look back in 1 Samuel chapter number three,

619
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,840
I want you to note the content

620
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,000
of God's message to Samuel in our text

621
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,720
and how the content of what God is going to say to Samuel,

622
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,800
how that it pertains to what God was going to do

623
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
really was a message of impending judgment.

624
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,760
God was graciously giving His servant

625
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,760
information regarding future events, right?

626
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,640
Look at it back in 1 Samuel chapter number three.

627
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,559
I'm so thankful that Eli had the sense,

628
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,960
the perception to say to Samuel,

629
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,440
it's not me that's calling you,

630
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,679
but God is calling you.

631
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,200
And when you hear him call,

632
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,840
say, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

633
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,160
And I'm thankful for the obedience of Samuel

634
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,960
that he says when he hears Samuel, Samuel,

635
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,440
he says, speak, for thy servant heareth.

636
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,919
And the Lord said to Samuel,

637
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,640
notice in verse number 11 back in 1 Samuel three,

638
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,640
behold, I will do a thing in Israel.

639
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,559
Now, is he telling him of something

640
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,799
that he's already done?

641
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,640
No.

642
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
He had the Pentateuch.

643
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,760
He had the book of Moses.

644
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,160
The Scriptures were available.

645
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,640
And there was some truth that was there for him

646
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,760
that if he wanted to read about some of those events,

647
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,520
he could have read of some of those events.

648
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,160
But God says, as God's speaking to Samuel,

649
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,559
I will do a thing in Israel.

650
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,400
I will do, future tense,

651
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,559
something that's going to happen.

652
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,760
And God is graciously revealing information

653
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,440
to his servant regarding future events.

654
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,280
Notice it says,

655
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,799
at which both the ears of everyone

656
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
that heareth it shall tingle.

657
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,600
In that day, I will perform against Eli

658
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,280
all things which I have spoken concerning his house.

659
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,440
When I begin, I will also make an end.

660
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,400
For I have told him that I will judge his house forever

661
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,480
for the iniquity which he knoweth

662
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,160
because his sons made themselves vile

663
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,520
and he restrained them not.

664
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
And therefore, I have sworn under the house of Eli

665
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
that the iniquity of Eli's house shall be forgiven.

666
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,640
house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever."

667
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,440
The Bible tells us in verse number 15,

668
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,320
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord.

669
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,360
Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.

670
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,840
I want you to consider with me this morning as we note the posture of God's servant,

671
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,040
the way in which he says,

672
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,840
Speak, for thy servant heareth.

673
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,920
And I want you to note the content of what God's message is to Samuel here in this text

674
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,820
of Scripture with regard to future events and God revealing to his servant what he was

675
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,700
going to do.

676
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,880
And I want you to think about what we have in the pages of Scripture.

677
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,020
You know, God is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

678
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,900
He is outside time.

679
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,020
He transcends us.

680
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,740
He has all wisdom and all knowledge.

681
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,380
He is the Lord God Omnipotent, and He rules and He reigns, and He has a plan.

682
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,480
I understand sometimes we live in the midst of the chaos and confusion in which we're

683
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,900
dealing with in our world today, and there's all sorts of things going on, and we could

684
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,520
look as if things are falling apart, but I believe wholeheartedly that things are falling

685
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,060
in place.

686
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:25,560
And I find that as we read the pages of God's Word, that He has graciously given us information

687
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,300
regarding future events.

688
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:36,020
"'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'"

689
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,180
I don't have time to turn to each of the passages, but I want you to hear these verses of Scripture.

690
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,500
Maybe you can jot them down to look at later, and this is just a few verses of sampling

691
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,100
in 2 Thessalonians 2.

692
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,420
In verse number 7, Paul says to the believers in Thessalonica, "'For the mystery of iniquity

693
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,780
doth already work.'"

694
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,180
Can I tell you that it's working?

695
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,060
The mystery of iniquity is working.

696
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,860
It doth already work.

697
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,780
Notice in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 1, that Paul says, "'This know also.'"

698
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:15,059
God wants His people to know some things, and Paul is giving this truth to his son in

699
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:21,820
the faith, Timothy, and he says that in the last days, perilous times shall come.

700
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:28,020
That word perilous, it means troublesome, dangerous, harsh, or fierce.

701
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,419
He says, Timothy, I want you to know something.

702
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:36,620
I want you to have knowledge of this truth that in the last days, perilous times shall

703
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
come.

704
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,380
He tells them a few verses later in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 13, "'But evil men and

705
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:50,340
seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.'"

706
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,139
John tells us this in 1 John 4, in verse number 1, that many false prophets are gone

707
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,380
out into the world.

708
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,279
You can read 1 Timothy chapter number 4.

709
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,580
You can read 2 Peter chapter number 2.

710
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,300
You can read the short book of Jude, and you can find in each of those passages of Scripture

711
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,380
that God is giving us a description of false teachers.

712
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,980
He's letting us know, He's informing us of how these false teachers are going to operate

713
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,700
and what they're going to do.

714
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,419
He's giving us this information.

715
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,020
And then I want you to turn to the book of Revelation, and I want you to look at the

716
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,940
way in which this book begins, and understanding with me that as we look at this passage of

717
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,779
Scripture in 1 Samuel 3, when Samuel says, "'Speak, for thy servant heareth,' that we

718
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:45,919
know the posture of God's servant and the way in which he desires to hear what God has

719
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,139
for him, and God reveals to him the content of the messages with regard to future events,

720
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,559
that which would come to pass in Israel.'"

721
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,400
And we can read and understand that it did come to pass, just as God said that it would,

722
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,480
and we can have confidence that everything that God has told us, God will do.

723
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Revelation 1.

724
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 1.

725
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:17,920
"'The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him,' notice this, "'to show unto

726
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:27,920
his servants things which must shortly come to pass.'

727
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,000
And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.'"

728
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,880
The book of Revelation, the very first verse tells us that it's the revelation of Jesus

729
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Christ, it's not the revelation of John, it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that was given

730
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:49,080
to John, and the Bible tells us that it was given, notice the phrase right in the middle

731
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:59,360
of the verse, "'to show unto his servants things,' notice this, "'which must shortly

732
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
come to pass.'"

733
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,360
Now, I understand shortly, from our perspective, is different than God's perspective, amen?

734
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Because with God, a day is a thousand years, and a thousand years is a day, according to

735
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,040
2 Peter chapter number 3.

736
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,679
We're stuck in time, and we have this weird perception of things that are short or long,

737
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,000
so on and so forth, but we find that the key here, for me, is that the Bible says that

738
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,239
he wants to show these things unto his servants, and then he says, "'which must shortly come

739
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,239
to pass.'"

740
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,160
And for some reason, we're fooling ourselves to think that we're never going to deal with

741
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,119
what God tells us is going to happen in the future.

742
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,200
We may be the generation that lives through some of these events that take place, we often

743
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,640
speak of desiring to be the generation that's raptured out of here, that hears the trumpet,

744
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,480
and we're raptured out of here, well then guess what, there's a whole lot of stuff that

745
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,480
has to happen, it's just the way it is, and God's given us that truth.

746
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,080
He's revealed to us in his word, things which must shortly come to pass.

747
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,520
We've noticed, as we've looked at 1 Samuel chapter number 3, the persistence of God,

748
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,200
we've noticed the perception of Eli, the posture of God's servant, Samuel, and I want you to

749
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,200
consider as we close this morning, a principle for today.

750
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,360
Consider with me a principle for today.

751
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,160
As we look here in Revelation chapter number 1, and we see that the Bible says that God

752
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,160
is going to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass, I want you

753
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,239
to just for a moment give some attention to chapters 2 and 3 of the book of Revelation.

754
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,119
As we find in this portion of Scripture, in these two chapters, that on seven occasions

755
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:50,800
this phrase is repeated, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

756
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,040
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

757
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,760
What did Samuel say?

758
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,040
Speak, for thy servant heareth.

759
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,320
The intent, the idea of hearing with a view of obedience, of obeying, we find here that

760
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,160
this word hear, when it says in Revelation 2 and 3, he that hath an ear, let him hear,

761
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,480
it's to attend to, to consider what is or has been said, to understand.

762
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,000
It's that same Greek word that was used back in Luke chapter number 10, when the Bible

763
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,320
speaks of Mary who sat at the feet of Jesus and heard his word.

764
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,279
Notice in Revelation 2, in verse number 7, as God is speaking to the church at Ephesus,

765
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:42,000
the Bible says he that hath an ear, let him hear.

766
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,959
I'm not going to read the entirety of these verses.

767
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:48,679
I want to give you a principle, and I hope that it all wraps up and makes sense to us

768
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,679
this morning.

769
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,880
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

770
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,880
He says to the church at Ephesus, to the church in Smyrna, skip down to chapter 2 in

771
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,559
verse number 11, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

772
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:08,520
The church at Pergamos in chapter 2 in verse number 17, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

773
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:16,119
The church at Thyatira in chapter 2 in verse number 29, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

774
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,200
The church in Sardis in chapter number 3 in verse number 6, he that hath an ear, let

775
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,239
him hear.

776
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:29,239
The church in Philadelphia in chapter 3 in verse number 13, he that hath an ear, let

777
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,160
him hear.

778
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,179
And the church of the Laodiceans, I want to read three verses as we consider what he says

779
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,179
to this church.

780
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:45,760
It is not called the church of Laodicea, it is called the church of the Laodiceans.

781
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,599
And there is a distinction there, by the way.

782
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,599
Notice it in verse number 14, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write.

783
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:05,799
But notice with me in verse number 20 of chapter number 3, behold, I, who is speaking, Jesus.

784
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:11,440
These are the letters that are given to the churches in Asia, these seven churches.

785
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,239
This is the church of the Laodiceans.

786
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,880
Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

787
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,799
If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will sup with him

788
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:30,340
and he with me.

789
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,440
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame

790
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,799
and am set down with my father in his throne.

791
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:45,979
Then we see this repeated phrase in verse number 22, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

792
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,200
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

793
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,280
Notice with me in verse number 20 as we've read the verse of Scripture, that the Bible

794
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,000
says behold, I stand at the door and knock.

795
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,559
The imagery that is given to us here in this text of Scripture is that the church of the

796
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:01,919
Laodiceans.

797
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:06,399
that the Lord Jesus Christ is on the outside of his church. You understand

798
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:10,759
that the church is the pillar and ground of truth, but the church is his church.

799
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:15,559
Remember Jesus said in the book of Matthew, I will build my church and the

800
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,559
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. We understand that the church

801
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,239
according to Acts chapter number 20 that Jesus Christ bought it with his own

802
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,239
blood. We understand the Bible tells us that husbands are to love their wives

803
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,599
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it in the book of Ephesians.

804
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,279
And we find here that God owns the church, the Lord Jesus Christ, he

805
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:40,799
instituted the church, and here in chapter number three, a church that is

806
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:46,279
full of goods. The Bible says that this is how God describes them.

807
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:50,599
Excuse me, this is how they are described here. Notice it says, because thou sayest,

808
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,639
this is what they say of themselves, I am rich and increased with goods and have

809
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,039
need of nothing. And God says, but you know not that thou art wretched,

810
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:08,839
miserable, poor, blind, and naked. They're having a little club. It's the church of

811
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,279
the Laodiceans. And the imagery that God gives us in verse number 20 is that

812
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:20,879
Jesus is on the outside of his church and he's knocking. He's knocking on the

813
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:25,959
door of the church. And the Bible says, then I stand at the door and knock. You

814
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:33,959
notice that God does not force himself in. You remember when Peter was knocking

815
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,919
on the door when they were praying for him in Acts chapter number 12?

816
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:41,679
Rhoda was excited, wasn't she? But she forgot to do something. She forgot to

817
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,879
open the door! Right? She says, it's Peter! He's knocking on the door! What did they

818
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:54,159
say? You're mad. You're crazy. That's what they say to her. It's his spirit. And she's

819
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,639
like, no! He's knocking! And eventually they open the door and Peter's able to go in and

820
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,959
he tells them some things. He shares how God had miraculously answered their

821
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:09,639
prayers and delivered him from prison. Read it in Acts 12. Here we find that Jesus is

822
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,719
knocking on the door of his church and as he's knocking there, he says, I stand at

823
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:18,559
the door and knock. Notice what it says, if any man hear my voice, notice, and open

824
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:24,159
the door. Would you allow me this morning to make an application from what we see

825
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,599
in 1 Samuel chapter number 3 when Samuel is there and he's hearing the voice of

826
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,079
God and he hears Samuel and he runs to Eli and says, here am I! You've called! And

827
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,479
Eli says, I haven't called you. Go back to sleep. Go back to bed. And Eli goes back

828
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:43,679
to bed and he hears, excuse me, Samuel goes back to bed and he hears Samuel and he

829
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:50,719
runs into Eli again and says, you've called! Here am I! I haven't called you. Go

830
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:58,399
back to sleep. And on that third time, Eli perceives it's the Lord. And he says,

831
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:06,239
Samuel, when you hear it again, here's what you need to say. Speak, Lord, for thy

832
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:13,399
servant heareth. What good counsel. We find that Samuel followed that counsel and the

833
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:22,559
Lord came that fourth time and said, Samuel, Samuel. And he said, speak, for thy servant

834
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,839
heareth. And the Lord said unto Samuel. It tells us here in Revelation chapter number

835
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,199
3 and verse number 20 that if any man hear my voice and open the door, notice what it

836
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:44,199
says, I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me. You know, he desires to

837
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:55,079
have fellowship with you. He desires to speak to you. In fact, he's waiting for you to enter

838
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,599
into his presence to invite him to speak to you. To say as you would get into a quiet

839
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:08,559
place and open up the precious Word of God and as you open this precious book and you

840
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,599
say, Lord, open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. But

841
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,719
Lord, would you speak for my servant heareth. I mean, I want to know who you are and I want

842
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:24,919
to know what you've done. But I want you to speak to me. I want you to show me how to

843
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:31,279
be a better father, a better mother, a better husband, a better wife, a better son or daughter,

844
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:36,359
a better church member, a better pastor. God speaks to me. God gives us instruction on

845
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,239
all of those things that I just mentioned. Maybe you want to be a better employee. Maybe

846
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:47,239
you want to be a better employer. God speaks about those things as well. We say, God, speak

847
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:54,519
for thy servant heareth. We go to the Word of God. And as we make application this morning

848
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:59,799
and look at this principle for today, we can rejoice in understanding that still to this

849
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:06,799
very hour, God is desiring to speak to His servants. Are you hearing the voice of God?

850
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:18,719
Are you spending time in this precious book? Are you allowing the Word of God to permeate

851
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:26,079
into your soul? To impact your behavior? To have faith in what God has said? To understand

852
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:35,199
that He has given us, He has taught us things that must shortly come to pass. That just

853
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,759
as He revealed to Samuel in 1 Samuel chapter number 3, these things concerning future judgment

854
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,479
that would come upon the house of Eli, that God has given us in His Word truth regarding

855
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:53,479
future events. And we go to His Word and we say, speak for thy servant heareth. But

856
00:45:56,479 --> 00:46:03,479
that attitude is critical. It is a critical attitude that we have that we come to God

857
00:46:04,279 --> 00:46:11,279
and we say, Lord, would you speak to me? Would you give me truth? And would you help me to

858
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,239
respond to that truth? Would you help me to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only?

859
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:23,239
Would you help me to put in practice that which you've given me in your Word? I don't

860
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:28,399
just want to soak it all in. I want to be a conduit. I want to learn the Word of God.

861
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:33,239
I want you to teach me some things and then I can share that with others. And I can have

862
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:40,239
an understanding of the times in which we're living. See, God has graciously given us His

863
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:47,559
Word. But He doesn't make you read it. No one's going to force you to read the Bible.

864
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,399
Now maybe if you're a child here this morning, you say, my parents forced me to read the

865
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:59,399
Bible. Be thankful for that. Honestly. Because they would help you to develop a walk with

866
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:07,239
God. I'll never forget the day in which I sat in our house in Manassas and when our

867
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,699
children were younger, of course we'd read the Bible to them. And we still to this day

868
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:18,359
have family devotions together, all of us. And we would encourage our children as they

869
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,159
got a little older to read the Bible for themselves. And learn to read the Bible. Learn to study

870
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,479
the Bible. One year for Christmas, one of our children, they would come to me regularly

871
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,199
and ask me, what does this word mean? What does that word mean? It was encouraging to

872
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:37,559
me. It's encouraging when my children say, I was reading the Bible, what does this mean?

873
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,799
Right now we've done various things in our family devotions, but right now as a family,

874
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:48,519
each month we're reading through the book of Proverbs, individually. Today is August

875
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:52,799
8th, and so we'll be reading Proverbs chapter number 8 individually. And we have family

876
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:58,639
devotions tonight. We each will share, what did God show you? How did God speak to you

877
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:03,479
through Proverbs 8 today? And undoubtedly, Tim, somebody's going to say, that was my

878
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:09,919
verse! Because God used that verse in their life. And undoubtedly, I want to go first,

879
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:12,799
I want to go first, can I go first? Because I don't want anyone to take my verse, that

880
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:19,799
kind of a thing. But it's exciting. We're trying to help them, but I'll never forget

881
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:26,959
when I was sitting on the couch in Manassas and we'd ask the children, did you read your

882
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:33,039
Bible today? And I remember Joseph was walking upstairs one day, and I was sitting there

883
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,479
in the living room, and many of you were at our house in Manassas, and you know the layout.

884
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:40,279
And he kind of, as he would walk up the stairs, he could see right where I was sitting. And

885
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:47,279
he looked at me and he said, hey daddy, did you read your Bible today? You know, I was

886
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:56,039
thankful to be able to say, yes I did. And to share how God had spoken to my family.

887
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:01,919
God had opened my heart that day. But can I tell you this morning that we shouldn't

888
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:07,440
just read our Bibles because somebody might ask us if we read our Bible today? God wants

889
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,440
to speak to you. He wants to speak to you. He's given you this perfect, preserved Word

890
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:22,839
of God. It's profitable for us. It's a probing book. Amen? It's a piercing book. It's a

891
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,519
proving book. And we get into it and we say, speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. Oh, would

892
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:39,799
you teach me truth from your Word? I'm so thankful you've given it. But the principle

893
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:46,799
that we look at this morning is just as God was seeking to speak to Samuel, today God's

894
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,599
desiring to speak to you. Maybe you're saying, man, it's been a long time since I've heard

895
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:58,479
the voice of God. Maybe I've neglected reading the Word of God. I think it was Brianna and

896
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:01,839
her testimony a couple of weeks ago after coming from camp and maybe it was one of the

897
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:01,959
other days.

898
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:05,879
teenagers. I don't remember for sure. I didn't jot it down. But they made a

899
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:10,039
statement about one of the things that Pastor Michael Jones said during his

900
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:17,159
message that many believers respect the Bible. Have any of you said that? And that if any of

901
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,679
us were to throw the Bible on the ground, oh what's going on? You know we respect

902
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:28,239
the Bible. And that pastor said at teen camp that many of God's people respect

903
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:36,999
the Bible, but only a few read the Bible. Statistics come out every year. I've

904
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:42,279
never been called and asked, so I'm not sure who has been polled. But statistics

905
00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:49,399
are coming out all the time of how often people that claim to be followers of

906
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:55,119
Jesus Christ read their Bible. You know there are very few in the whole of

907
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,359
Christendom, however you want to cut that up and dice it up, that have ever

908
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:08,799
read the Bible cover to cover. God wants to speak. God desired to speak to Samuel.

909
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:18,759
God had something to tell Samuel. But Samuel had to say, speak Lord for thy

910
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:26,599
servant heareth. This morning, oh that a whole bunch of us would just say, speak

911
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:34,119
Lord for thy servant heareth. I don't want to just go through the motions of

912
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:39,919
checking a list of, I read my Bible today, but I desire that God would speak to me.

913
00:51:39,919 --> 00:51:49,399
Give me truth. Help me in my walk with Him. Speak Lord for thy servant heareth.

914
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:58,479
Let's pray. Father, we're so thankful this morning for your Word, the precious Bible.

915
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:16,239
We sing songs about the Bible. We claim to believe the Bible. We have discussions with

916
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:25,159
people about the Bible. God, we're so thankful that you've given us this book and that you

917
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:33,399
desire to speak to us. And I pray that this morning, in the quietness of the moment, that

918
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:40,339
you would help us as your servants to respond in the same fashion in which Samuel responded.

919
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:50,559
And we would say, speak Lord for thy servant heareth. As we consider the message to each

920
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:57,639
of the churches in Asia, there in Revelation 2, in verse number 3, he that hath an ear,

921
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:08,239
let him hear. You stand at the door and knock. If any man will hear and open, oh God, I pray

922
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:17,999
that we would enjoy that rich fellowship with you around your Word and in prayer. Speak

923
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:24,919
to our hearts. Give us confidence in what thy Word says. Help us to understand those

924
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:31,559
things which must shortly come to pass. We pray, God, that if there'd be one that's present,

925
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:38,919
not sure of heaven, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation. For each

926
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:45,559
of us that have trusted you as Lord and Savior, I pray that we'd have a renewed commitment

927
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:56,879
with regard to our walk with thee, specifically with regard to our Bible reading. As we look

928
00:53:56,879 --> 00:54:03,399
at this Old Testament account and make application in our lives today, that we'd be challenged

929
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:10,119
and that we would say, speak Lord for thy servant heareth. Would you move and work as

930
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,479
only you can, and we'll give you the glory for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you

931
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:19,999
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around. Kimberly's

932
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:26,359
going to play quietly on the piano. Give you an opportunity to respond, an invitation.

933
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:29,159
Maybe you want to make your pew an altar. Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned

934
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:35,119
altar. Maybe you just need to come and say, as Samuel said, speak for thy servant heareth.

935
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:42,439
Renew that commitment, desiring, understanding that God desires to speak to you, but desiring

936
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:46,039
to hear from him. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
