WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
after number three i'm not sure when the food's going to be here

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.519
uh... but i know one thing that's a blessing is when you have lunch on the

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.039
property after the service you have a little bit of liberty to preach a little

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.119
longer

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.279
and when you haven't reached in as long as i haven't reached then you take that

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.920
liberty if you will

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.479
uh... i got four points this morning and so we'll get through it but uh... lunch

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:22.079
is going to be provided here on the property

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.360
and so i trust that you will pay attention throughout the end of the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.760
entirety of the message i trust to be a blessing to you

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.200
first samuel chapter three is a a familiar passage of scripture here in the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.000
beginning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.159
of the book of first samuel of course we know that the lord graciously answered

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.479
the prayer of hannah

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.240
we read about the first chapter of uh... in first samuel chapter one we read

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.799
about the life of hannah

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.880
and of course her husband el cana and the bible tells us that hannah

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.680
was barren

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.000
she had no children

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.200
we find that though she was barren she earnestly sought the lord

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.479
and i'll say this she plainly made a request she asked for a son she's very

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.279
plain in her request to the lord

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:08.000
and uh... we find that as we study the whole of scripture the bible says ask

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.480
and you shall receive

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.440
and uh... you have not because you ask not you have not because you ask amiss

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.839
and

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:19.000
we understand some of those truths with regard to prayer but we find that hannah

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.599
very plainly seeks the lord and prays earnestly

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.000
for a son

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.839
god answers her prayer

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:31.680
and we know that the result of that answer is the birth of samuel and we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.760
know that

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.080
uh... the name samuel in fact hannah states this in first samuel one in verse

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.199
number twenty

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:43.680
uh... the reason why she named him samuel because i have asked him

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.559
of the lord

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.239
you may remember that as hannah prayed

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.580
for a son that her prayer also included a promise

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.559
a vow if you will that she would give him unto the lord

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:59.279
all the days of his life

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.099
i'm thankful to report that

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.639
god answered the prayer of hannah

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:04.800
and hannah

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.380
she fulfilled the vow that she made to god

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.800
and samuel ministered in shiloh with eli and we find that the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.160
word of god will tell us as we begin first samuel chapter number three

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.399
uh... the first several verses give us really a setting for our message this

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.220
morning

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.960
notice the bible says this in first samuel three in verse number one

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:31.779
and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.279
the word of the lord was precious

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.240
in those days

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.039
notice what the bible says there was no

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.460
open vision

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.320
you're familiar with that truth in proverbs twenty nine in verse eighteen

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080
where there's no vision

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.800
the people perish

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
and that's not speaking about having a vision for a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.360
a land or a people or so on and so forth that's regarding

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.119
the giving of god's word we understand all scripture is given by inspiration

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.000
of god

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.559
the bible says that the word of god was precious in those days

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.800
there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.119
when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.119
that he could not see

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:18.399
and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.639
where the ark of god was

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.259
and samuel was laid down

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.300
to sleep

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.699
we find several things here in the first three verses of first samuel chapter

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.500
one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.899
we find that samuel was serving god it says that he ministered unto the lord

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.619
before eli in verse number one we know that the

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.720
uh... scriptures tell us as i mentioned in verse number one that there was no

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.320
open vision that the word of god was precious in those days

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.339
the bible also tells us that eli was going blind he could not see

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.139
according to the end of verse number two

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.500
and the bible tells us something interesting in verse number three

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.740
that the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord you know that was to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.139
burn continually

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.699
the responsibility of the priest were to ensure that the oil was

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.860
put into those lamps so that they would burn continually

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.779
and we find the bible says that the lamp of god went out in the temple of the

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.860
lord where the ark of god was

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.820
and the bible tells us now that samuel

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.760
he went to sleep

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.799
and what a setting that god gives us for our text this morning

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.519
we focusing primarily on verses four through eleven you see in your bulletin

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.399
this morning

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:32.279
that the title of the message and really this is the short title is speak

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.540
the full title if you want the full title would be

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.359
as we find in verse number nine

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:40.600
speak lord

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.079
for thy servant

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.380
speak

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.679
lord

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:50.119
for thy servant

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:53.980
notice this morning if you're taking notes i want you to know the persistence

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.559
of the lord

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:56.959
in verses four through eight

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.959
god gives us the record

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:02.000
of his calling to his servant samuel

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.760
we would find as i've noted this morning the persistence of the lord

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.160
and we find that the lord desires to speak to samuel i'm thankful this

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.279
morning to report that god still desires to speak to his children

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.839
that god desires to speak to you

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.880
and to speak to me in fact if you've read your bible this morning already

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.799
uh... the lord spoke to you through his word i was

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:25.839
finishing up in reading this morning

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.880
in the book of nehemiah and reading the the truth of god's word

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.600
and how the lord minister to my heart personally several hours ago as i was

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.079
reading that portion of scripture and i'm thankful this morning

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:42.480
uh... for the persistence of god in the life of samuel notices we

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.200
understand the setting

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.440
uh... that that eli he's going blind he cannot see

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.519
uh... he's elderly we find that samuel was ministering before the lord

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.920
and we find that samuel goes to sleep and the bible says in verse number four

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.179
that the lord called samuel

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.000
the lord called samuel

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.320
and he answered samuel answered and said here am i and notice what he does

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.200
he ran unto eli and said

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.279
here am i

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:15.079
for thou callest me

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:18.559
this is a natural response i mean if you would understand the

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:21.600
the setting and all that was taking place and you consider the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.200
uh... the frailty of eli and you consider the

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.000
the responsibility in the ministry of samuel and you find that samuel hears

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.440
his voice called

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.000
samuel what is the natural thing for him to do is to run to eli to say here am i

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.480
you've called me

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.720
and eli says

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.720
i didn't call you

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200
notice in verse number five and he said

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.799
i called not

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:46.480
lie down again

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.739
and he went

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:49.320
and lay down

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.839
but verse number six says this notice the phrase in verse number four that the

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:55.119
lord called samuel in verse number six

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.200
and the lord called

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.399
yet

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.660
again

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.640
the persistence of god

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.399
the bible says he called yet again samuel

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.399
and samuel arose and went to eli

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.600
notice what he says here am i

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.640
for thou didst call me

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.920
and he answered i called not my son

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.079
lie down again

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:21.320
now at this point i'm not sure exactly all of the side story of what's going on

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.279
and uh... the the mind of samuel the mind of eli

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.399
uh... but i can imagine samuel as he

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:31.720
rose up that second time and he knows that he heard his name called and

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.119
he runs into where eli is and he says

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.839
you've called me

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.959
here am i he says i didn't call you

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.279
and samuel probably thinks he's going crazy right like what's going on

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:46.079
uh... i know that i heard my name called

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:50.119
he says lie down again at the end of verse number six that's eli's instruction

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:51.959
to samuel

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:56.279
the bible tells us in verse number seven now samuel did not yet know the lord

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:59.160
neither was the word of the lord yet revealed

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.320
unto him

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.459
again we see the persistence of the lord in verse number eight

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.880
the bible says the lord called samuel again

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.359
the third time

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:13.640
he arose and went to eli and said here am i

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.079
for thou didst call me

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.799
now i wonder again

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:19.760
uh... it may be the the

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.959
uh... tone of samuel of

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:26.279
trying to convince eli i know that you've called me

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.040
but now as we look at this text of scripture and we find uh...

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.119
the persistence of god and the

00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:36.080
the way in which he desires to speak to his servant we read again in verse

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.000
number ten

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.679
in the uh... the first phrase this is the lord came and stood

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.960
and called as at other times

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.000
samuel

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.299
aren't you thankful for the persistence of god

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:54.599
the fact that he desires to speak to us we

00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:59.200
have his word and we would say this morning that we have the complete canon

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.919
of scripture we have all that god desires for us to have been

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.599
in this book we find

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:08.000
the answers to the problems that we would face in life and

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.479
we find that it's in this book that we

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:15.140
uh... have the opportunity to hear the voice of god

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.200
what a blessing it is that god desires to speak to us and

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.359
we find that

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.960
uh... it is true this morning that we

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.119
we read many things

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:27.760
we listen to many things

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.280
but i wonder this morning how much time do we spend reading this book

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.320
how much time do we spend in the word of god

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.239
i have a library full of books i'm not suggesting this morning

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:39.559
that you should not read

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.880
uh... any other book but the reality

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.960
is that this book is a precious book it is a profitable book

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.719
and it is certainly important that we spend time in the word of god

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:54.520
so many people uh... they they desire to i want to be a good husband will read

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.919
the word of god because god is the one that created the home

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.320
god is the one that gives the instructions on

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.820
and how to be a good husband.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.120
I want to be a good wife.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.360
Then go to the Word of God

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.680
and find out what God says

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.960
about being a good wife.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.400
I want to be a good father,

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.960
a good mother, a good son,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.000
a good daughter,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.320
a good church member,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.600
a good pastor.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.280
The Word of God has all of that in it.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.240
And what a blessing that God desires

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.200
to speak to us.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.120
Sometimes we'll spend more time

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.880
reading a self-help book,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.320
reading a leadership book

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.720
from some human penman,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.680
reading some book on parenting

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.280
from someone that has written that book.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.520
Again, I'm not suggesting

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.520
that those aren't good resources,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.320
but we must read this book.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.960
And we must recognize this morning

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.120
that God desires to speak to you.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800
I understand that He speaks to us

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.920
through His Word.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.760
And I understand that He may not be

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.040
calling us this morning

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.280
in the same fashion in which He called Samuel.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.760
Here it's recorded in 1 Samuel 3.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.080
But I wonder this morning,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.520
are there times in your life

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.760
in which perhaps you've had a season,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.440
a dry season if you will,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.000
where you've not spent time

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.160
in the Word of God on a daily basis?

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.200
And the Holy Spirit of God,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.600
He's calling you

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.520
and He's giving you that thirst

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.000
and that desire for the Word of God.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.520
Perhaps there's a time in which

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.960
you've not been able to attend church regularly.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.520
You've not had the opportunity

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.120
to sit under the preaching

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120
of the Word of God

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.280
and you have a longing

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.440
and you have a desire

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.840
to hear the Word of God.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.640
To hear the voice of God.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.520
We find the persistence of the Lord.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.760
I'm so thankful that as we look

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.160
at 1 Samuel 3,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.960
that the Lord was persistent

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.760
in His calling of Samuel.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
Notice not only the persistence of the Lord,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.440
2, notice the perception of Eli.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.200
In verse 8, we find that it was the third time

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.920
in which the Lord called Samuel

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.440
and Samuel arises and goes to Eli

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.840
and says, here am I for thou didst call me.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.640
And you notice the end of v. 8,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640
the Bible says,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.240
and Eli perceived that the Lord

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.760
had called the child.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.080
I'm thankful for the perception of Eli.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.080
I'm thankful that as we would look

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.560
at this text of Scripture

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.480
and we'd understand what's taking place

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.360
and we'd understand the role of Eli

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.520
and the call that God is giving to Samuel,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.760
that Eli, of course, Samuel goes to him

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.640
each time assuming that it was Eli

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.480
that was calling.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.240
There was some need that Eli had.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.840
There was something that had happened

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.560
and Eli needed the assistance of Samuel.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.400
Thus, Samuel would run to Eli,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.280
but that's not what was taking place.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.720
It was the Lord who was calling Samuel.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.160
And the perception of Eli

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.760
is given to us here in v. 8.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.480
It says that he perceived

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.240
that the Lord had called the child.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.920
Now I know the perception of Eli,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.520
but I want you to understand

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.480
that Eli then gave good counsel.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.280
I'm thankful for the counsel that Eli gives.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.920
In v. 9 of our text of Scripture,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.400
after Eli perceived that it was the Lord

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.520
that called Samuel,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.720
he then gives some instruction,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.520
some counsel, if you will, to Samuel.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.360
And he says this,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.080
Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.720
Go, lie down.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.240
Now he had already told Samuel that

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.640
on a couple of occasions, had he not?

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.480
He had told him in v. 5,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.880
he says lie down again.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.360
Again in v. 6, lie down again.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.560
But now when Eli perceived

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.880
that it was the Lord that called the child,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.400
the instruction, the counsel

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.600
that Eli will give Samuel changes.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.960
It's not simply go lie down.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.880
But notice the Bible tells us in v. 9,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.640
Go lie down, and it shall be,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.360
if he call thee, that thou shalt say,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.360
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.120
So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.920
As we think about the perception of Eli,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.920
and we think about the counsel of Eli,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.040
what great counsel that he gives to Samuel.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.600
He tells Samuel to hear the voice calling him,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.600
Samuel, Samuel, and if he shall call thee again,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.200
here's what you need to say.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.920
Don't come running to me,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.800
I'm not the one calling you,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.800
but say, Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.080
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.360
The Bible tells us that Samuel went and lay down

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.240
in his place.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.640
We've noted already in v. 10,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.040
that the persistence of the Lord is recorded for us

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.880
where the Bible says that the Lord came

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.200
and stood and called as at other times,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.320
Samuel, Samuel.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.300
We note the persistence of God.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.760
We note the perception of Eli.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.980
But now I want you to note the posture of God's servant.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.040
The posture, the attitude, the position, if you will,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.760
of the servant of the Lord, that being Samuel.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.279
Notice the Bible tells us that the Lord came

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.040
and called us at other times and said,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.320
Samuel, Samuel.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.640
And notice in v. 10, the last phrase of the verse,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.640
then Samuel answered, Speak, for thy servant heareth.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.920
I'm so thankful for the response of Samuel

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.240
in this passage of Scripture

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.760
that he took heed to the counsel that he received from Eli.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.520
And of course, as we note that God calls again

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.240
and says, Samuel, Samuel,

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.899
and we find the posture of God's servant,

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:47.399
and we understand that here in the text of Scripture,

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:50.279
it helps us to understand the relationship, if you will,

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.279
that he indeed is Lord and we are his servants.

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.640
You know, it's a tremendous blessing

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.240
that he would speak to us.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.160
It really is.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.700
You know, there are some people in our world today

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.880
that are motivational speakers,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.279
that make lots of money giving speeches,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.399
and people pay lots of money to go listen to somebody talk

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:15.520
on some subject and so on and so forth,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.059
and they desire to hear the words of this individual.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.480
We could think of Solomon and all of his wisdom

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.520
and the way in which the Queen of Sheba traveled

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.880
to hear the wisdom of Solomon,

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.559
and we can understand those things,

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:32.399
but you understand that the omniscient, all-knowing God

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:37.399
has given us a book, and he desires to speak to us.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.480
And our posture should be one of speak, Lord,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.720
for thy servant heareth.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.720
We should have that desire to hear the voice of God

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.399
as we read the pages of Scripture

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:55.520
to understand that it's God's Word.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.760
And he desires to speak to us.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.559
This word heareth, when the Bible says speak,

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:04.679
for thy servant heareth,

00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:08.960
that word carries with it the idea of hearing, listening,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.240
but also with the purpose of obedience,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.679
the idea of hearing with a view of obeying.

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.240
Now that's a good understanding of us

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.660
as we dig in and understand really

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.440
what Samuel is saying here.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.440
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.240
I wonder this morning when we go to the Word of God,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.720
when we come to the house of God,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.320
when we are listening and reading the Bible ourselves,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.440
when we're hearing the preaching of the Word of God,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.440
are we saying speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.339
This hearing that is focused on,

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:49.559
that has the view of obedience,

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:52.580
that we would be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.200
I'm mindful of the truth that we find

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.920
within the Word of God where David will say in Psalm 86

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.440
and verse number 11 as he's praying,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.000
and what a great psalm of prayer.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.320
He says, teach me thy way, O Lord.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.880
I will walk in thy truth.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.820
That's the desire to hear the teaching of the Word of God,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.800
to hear the words of God with a purpose of obedience,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.119
with a mind of walking in thy truth.

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:25.720
I want you to note Psalm 119, if you will.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.440
What a wonderful passage of Scripture, Psalm 119.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440
If you turn over to that passage, if you will,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.239
hold your place there in 1 Samuel 3.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.559
Of course, we're familiar with Psalm 119,

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:39.960
the longest chapter in all of the Bible,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.520
a text of Scripture that is dedicated

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.220
to the very Word of God.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.419
And I want you to know how the psalm begins

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:49.880
in verse number one.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.419
Blessed are the undefiled in the way,

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:59.100
notice this, who walk in the way of the Lord.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.979
Who walk in the way of the Lord.

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:04.220
The idea of hearing the Word of God

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.900
with the purpose of obedience.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.739
Why is it that we would say, speak, Lord,

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:14.020
for thy servant heareth.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.679
I want to hear God speak,

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:20.260
and I purpose to obey what God says.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.820
We find here that as we would consider

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.900
the truth of God's Word,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.380
and the focus of these two psalms,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.900
and of course we could look at a number of truths

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.020
this morning, but I want you to think in your mind,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:33.900
you don't need to turn there,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.500
but in Luke chapter number 10,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.640
God records for us an event in the life

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.760
of the Lord Jesus Christ when He's at the house

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.880
of Mary and Martha, and we find the Bible says

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.880
that Mary, that she was also sat at Jesus' feet

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.640
and heard His Word.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.059
And heard His Word.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:57.600
The idea, again, of that particular Word

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.200
there in Luke 10 and verse number 39.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.860
of heard or hear is to attend to,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.900
to consider what is or has been said

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.020
to understand.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.560
She sat at the feet of Jesus

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.920
and heard His Word.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.760
I note back in 1 Samuel 3,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.160
as we take note of the posture

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.260
of God's servant,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.360
and I note the end of v. 10,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.160
he says,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.120
Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.420
And then I want you to notice

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.040
the first few words of v. 11.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.000
And the Lord said...

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.120
And the Lord said...

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.480
Isn't that sweet?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.920
I mean, the first three times,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.000
Samuel does not know that it's God

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.840
that's calling him to speak to him

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.320
and he runs to Eli.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.320
And Eli says, I've called thee not.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.380
On that third encounter,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.240
Eli perceives that it was the Lord

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.600
that called Samuel.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.020
And he says, when you hear his voice again,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.380
if he were to call to you again,

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.120
say, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.880
And Samuel goes back to his place

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.720
and Samuel hears again,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640
Samuel! Samuel!

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.160
And he responds by saying,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.320
Speak, for Thy servant heareth.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320
And the Bible says,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.200
the Lord said to Samuel.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.560
Wow!

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
Sometimes we say, well,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.880
He's just not talking to me.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.840
Are we saying, Speak, Lord,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.040
for Thy servant heareth?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.800
Are we responding?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.720
Are we entering our time

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.360
in the Word of God

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.760
by saying, Lord, I want You to speak to my heart.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.840
I want You to teach me Thy truth.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.800
I commit, I resolve to walk in Thy ways.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.160
Lord, show me things that I need to do.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.040
Show me things I need to stop doing.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:03.160
Lord, speak, for Thy servant heareth.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.000
I want you to note that this is first of many times

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.400
for Samuel when he heard the voice of God.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.360
When God spoke to him.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.400
We won't have time to go through all of them,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.000
but I want you to quickly go through several chapters

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.560
here in 1 Samuel with me.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.920
And I want to just note some of these verses of Scripture

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.000
in which God speaks to Samuel.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.240
We notice in verse number 11,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.400
the Lord said to Samuel.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.200
Notice in verse number 19,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200
the Bible says, and Samuel grew,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.440
and the Lord was with him

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.040
and did let none of his words fail to the ground,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.880
fall to the ground.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.040
Excuse me, verse number 21,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.240
and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.200
for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.680
by the Word of the Lord.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:48.840
Let's move over to chapter number 8, if you will.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.560
Of course, we're familiar with the text of Scripture

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.520
in verse number 8,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.040
where the people of God wanted a king.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.080
And the Bible tells us that the thing displeased Samuel,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.600
but in verse number 7 of 1 Samuel 8,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.840
the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Samuel.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.480
God's speaking to Samuel.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.200
God's giving Samuel truth.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.640
God is revealing to Samuel what is taking place.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.600
He says, hearken unto the voice of the people

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.240
and all that they say unto thee,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.960
for they have not rejected thee,

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.200
but they have rejected me,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.800
that I should not reign over them.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.880
Notice in chapter number 9.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.440
In verse number 15, this is very interesting.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.600
This is when Saul is coming,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.480
and they're going to go to the man of God, to Samuel.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.240
And the Bible says in verse number 15,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.080
now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.000
a day before Saul came, saying,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.080
notice what God tells him,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.040
the day before Saul comes,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.000
tomorrow, about this time,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.560
I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin,

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.440
and thou shalt anoint him to be captain

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.640
over my people Israel,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.200
that he may save my people

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.080
out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.520
For I have looked upon my people

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.200
because their cry is coming to me.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.000
And when Samuel saw, notice,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.480
the Lord said unto him,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.640
behold, the man whom I spake to thee of,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.240
this same shall reign over my people.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.760
The day before Saul even arrives,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.480
God speaks in the ear of Samuel

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.400
and tells him that Saul's going to come,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.200
and that he is to anoint this one to be king over Israel.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.800
Notice in chapter number 15,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.760
just picking a few here,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.520
where the Bible tells us that the Lord spoke to Samuel

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.680
in chapter number 15,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.559
the partial obedience of Saul

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:36.760
with the situation there with the Amalekites,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.760
and the Bible tells us in verse number 10,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.559
then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying,

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:46.520
and God's going to give Samuel some truth

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.600
with regard to the rejection of Saul

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.960
being king over Israel.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.800
You find in chapter number 16,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.880
that the Lord said unto Samuel,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.120
how long wilt thou mourn for Saul?

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.480
Seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.600
fill thine horn with oil,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.760
and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.720
for I have provided me a king among his sons.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.480
Of course, the Bible as you're familiar with,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.320
the passage of Scripture in verse number six,

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.800
that the sons of Jesse are to come,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.040
and he looks upon Eliab and said,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.600
surely the Lord's anointed is before me.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.760
But notice verse number seven,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.800
but the Lord said unto Samuel.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.840
Aren't you thankful that God spoke to Samuel?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.240
Because when he sees Eliab,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.880
he says, surely this is the one.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.440
But God spoke to Samuel.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.120
And God said to Samuel, this isn't him.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.760
He says, look not on his countenance

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.040
or on the height of his stature,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.600
because I have refused him.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.279
For the Lord seeth not as man seeth,

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.840
for man looketh on the outward appearance,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.200
but the Lord looketh on the heart.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.320
One by one, the sons of Jesse pass by.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.440
And God says, no, no, no.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.880
Aren't you thankful that God spoke to Samuel?

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.279
Aren't you thankful that Samuel learned to say,

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:09.760
speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.200
The Bible tells us that they come to a place

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.080
and the Lord hath not chosen any of these,

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.840
and He asks the question to Jesse,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.279
are here all thy children?

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:21.520
And He tells them that David the youngest,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.240
of course, He doesn't even give his name

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.800
in verse number 11, but He says,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.240
there remaineth yet the youngest,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.720
and behold, he keepeth the sheep.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.520
Then the Bible says in verse number 12,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.640
as David appears, it says,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.080
and he sent and brought him in,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.840
and now he was ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.520
and goodly to look to,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.640
and notice this phrase, and the Lord said,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.640
and the Lord said, arise, anoint him, for this is he.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.000
Then I want you to notice the response.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.480
Remember, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:57.000
The word hereth carries with it that idea

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.080
of hearing with a view of obeying.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.920
Samuel had this consistency.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.720
When God spoke to him in chapter number nine

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.279
and said, hey, Saul's gonna come

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:10.400
and I want you to anoint him, did he?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.240
He did.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.600
He obeyed the Lord.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.520
And here, in chapter number 16,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.600
we notice the Bible says that the Lord said,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.920
arise, anoint him, for this is he.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.920
Then, verse number 13, Samuel took the horn of oil

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.960
and anointed him in the midst of his brethren.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.480
The Spirit of the Lord came upon David

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480
from that day forward.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.640
So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.960
I've taken this few minutes to look

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.960
through these verses of Scripture

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.400
to see that here in chapter number three

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.600
was the first of many times in the life of Samuel

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.040
when the Lord spoke to him.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.559
And I want you to consider with me

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:50.520
as we look back in 1 Samuel chapter number three,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.840
I want you to note the content

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.000
of God's message to Samuel in our text

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.720
and how the content of what God is going to say to Samuel,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.800
how that it pertains to what God was going to do

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.279
really was a message of impending judgment.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.760
God was graciously giving His servant

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.760
information regarding future events, right?

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.640
Look at it back in 1 Samuel chapter number three.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.559
I'm so thankful that Eli had the sense,

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:29.960
the perception to say to Samuel,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.440
it's not me that's calling you,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.679
but God is calling you.

00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:34.200
And when you hear him call,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.840
say, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.160
And I'm thankful for the obedience of Samuel

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.960
that he says when he hears Samuel, Samuel,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.440
he says, speak, for thy servant heareth.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.919
And the Lord said to Samuel,

00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:48.640
notice in verse number 11 back in 1 Samuel three,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.640
behold, I will do a thing in Israel.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.559
Now, is he telling him of something

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:58.799
that he's already done?

00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:59.640
No.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.520
He had the Pentateuch.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.760
He had the book of Moses.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.160
The Scriptures were available.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.640
And there was some truth that was there for him

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.760
that if he wanted to read about some of those events,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.520
he could have read of some of those events.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.160
But God says, as God's speaking to Samuel,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.559
I will do a thing in Israel.

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.400
I will do, future tense,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.559
something that's going to happen.

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:27.760
And God is graciously revealing information

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.440
to his servant regarding future events.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.280
Notice it says,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.799
at which both the ears of everyone

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.720
that heareth it shall tingle.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.600
In that day, I will perform against Eli

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.280
all things which I have spoken concerning his house.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.440
When I begin, I will also make an end.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.400
For I have told him that I will judge his house forever

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.480
for the iniquity which he knoweth

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.160
because his sons made themselves vile

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.520
and he restrained them not.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.080
And therefore, I have sworn under the house of Eli

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.880
that the iniquity of Eli's house shall be forgiven.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.640
house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever."

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.440
The Bible tells us in verse number 15,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.320
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.360
Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.840
I want you to consider with me this morning as we note the posture of God's servant,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.040
the way in which he says,

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.840
Speak, for thy servant heareth.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.920
And I want you to note the content of what God's message is to Samuel here in this text

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:38.820
of Scripture with regard to future events and God revealing to his servant what he was

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.700
going to do.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.880
And I want you to think about what we have in the pages of Scripture.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.020
You know, God is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.900
He is outside time.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.020
He transcends us.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.740
He has all wisdom and all knowledge.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:02.380
He is the Lord God Omnipotent, and He rules and He reigns, and He has a plan.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.480
I understand sometimes we live in the midst of the chaos and confusion in which we're

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.900
dealing with in our world today, and there's all sorts of things going on, and we could

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.520
look as if things are falling apart, but I believe wholeheartedly that things are falling

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.060
in place.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:25.560
And I find that as we read the pages of God's Word, that He has graciously given us information

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.300
regarding future events.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:36.020
"'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'"

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:41.180
I don't have time to turn to each of the passages, but I want you to hear these verses of Scripture.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.500
Maybe you can jot them down to look at later, and this is just a few verses of sampling

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.100
in 2 Thessalonians 2.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:54.420
In verse number 7, Paul says to the believers in Thessalonica, "'For the mystery of iniquity

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.780
doth already work.'"

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.180
Can I tell you that it's working?

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.060
The mystery of iniquity is working.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.860
It doth already work.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:08.780
Notice in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 1, that Paul says, "'This know also.'"

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:15.059
God wants His people to know some things, and Paul is giving this truth to his son in

00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:21.820
the faith, Timothy, and he says that in the last days, perilous times shall come.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:28.020
That word perilous, it means troublesome, dangerous, harsh, or fierce.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.419
He says, Timothy, I want you to know something.

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:36.620
I want you to have knowledge of this truth that in the last days, perilous times shall

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.620
come.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.380
He tells them a few verses later in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 13, "'But evil men and

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:50.340
seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.'"

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.139
John tells us this in 1 John 4, in verse number 1, that many false prophets are gone

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:58.380
out into the world.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.279
You can read 1 Timothy chapter number 4.

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.580
You can read 2 Peter chapter number 2.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:09.300
You can read the short book of Jude, and you can find in each of those passages of Scripture

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.380
that God is giving us a description of false teachers.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:19.980
He's letting us know, He's informing us of how these false teachers are going to operate

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.700
and what they're going to do.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.419
He's giving us this information.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:28.020
And then I want you to turn to the book of Revelation, and I want you to look at the

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:33.940
way in which this book begins, and understanding with me that as we look at this passage of

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:39.779
Scripture in 1 Samuel 3, when Samuel says, "'Speak, for thy servant heareth,' that we

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:45.919
know the posture of God's servant and the way in which he desires to hear what God has

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:52.139
for him, and God reveals to him the content of the messages with regard to future events,

00:33:52.139 --> 00:33:54.559
that which would come to pass in Israel.'"

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:59.400
And we can read and understand that it did come to pass, just as God said that it would,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:05.480
and we can have confidence that everything that God has told us, God will do.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.480
Revelation 1.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.880
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 1.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:17.920
"'The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him,' notice this, "'to show unto

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:27.920
his servants things which must shortly come to pass.'

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:34.000
And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.'"

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:38.880
The book of Revelation, the very first verse tells us that it's the revelation of Jesus

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.880
Christ, it's not the revelation of John, it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that was given

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:49.080
to John, and the Bible tells us that it was given, notice the phrase right in the middle

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:59.360
of the verse, "'to show unto his servants things,' notice this, "'which must shortly

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.360
come to pass.'"

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:07.360
Now, I understand shortly, from our perspective, is different than God's perspective, amen?

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.360
Because with God, a day is a thousand years, and a thousand years is a day, according to

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.040
2 Peter chapter number 3.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.679
We're stuck in time, and we have this weird perception of things that are short or long,

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:24.000
so on and so forth, but we find that the key here, for me, is that the Bible says that

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.239
he wants to show these things unto his servants, and then he says, "'which must shortly come

00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:30.239
to pass.'"

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.160
And for some reason, we're fooling ourselves to think that we're never going to deal with

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.119
what God tells us is going to happen in the future.

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:41.200
We may be the generation that lives through some of these events that take place, we often

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:47.640
speak of desiring to be the generation that's raptured out of here, that hears the trumpet,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.480
and we're raptured out of here, well then guess what, there's a whole lot of stuff that

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:57.480
has to happen, it's just the way it is, and God's given us that truth.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:04.080
He's revealed to us in his word, things which must shortly come to pass.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.520
We've noticed, as we've looked at 1 Samuel chapter number 3, the persistence of God,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:15.200
we've noticed the perception of Eli, the posture of God's servant, Samuel, and I want you to

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.200
consider as we close this morning, a principle for today.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.360
Consider with me a principle for today.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.160
As we look here in Revelation chapter number 1, and we see that the Bible says that God

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.160
is going to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass, I want you

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:37.239
to just for a moment give some attention to chapters 2 and 3 of the book of Revelation.

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:42.119
As we find in this portion of Scripture, in these two chapters, that on seven occasions

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:50.800
this phrase is repeated, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.040
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.760
What did Samuel say?

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.040
Speak, for thy servant heareth.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.320
The intent, the idea of hearing with a view of obedience, of obeying, we find here that

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:13.160
this word hear, when it says in Revelation 2 and 3, he that hath an ear, let him hear,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.480
it's to attend to, to consider what is or has been said, to understand.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.000
It's that same Greek word that was used back in Luke chapter number 10, when the Bible

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.320
speaks of Mary who sat at the feet of Jesus and heard his word.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.279
Notice in Revelation 2, in verse number 7, as God is speaking to the church at Ephesus,

00:37:36.279 --> 00:37:42.000
the Bible says he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.959
I'm not going to read the entirety of these verses.

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:48.679
I want to give you a principle, and I hope that it all wraps up and makes sense to us

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:49.679
this morning.

00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:50.880
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.880
He says to the church at Ephesus, to the church in Smyrna, skip down to chapter 2 in

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.559
verse number 11, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:08.520
The church at Pergamos in chapter 2 in verse number 17, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:16.119
The church at Thyatira in chapter 2 in verse number 29, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:22.200
The church in Sardis in chapter number 3 in verse number 6, he that hath an ear, let

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.239
him hear.

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:29.239
The church in Philadelphia in chapter 3 in verse number 13, he that hath an ear, let

00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:31.160
him hear.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:37.179
And the church of the Laodiceans, I want to read three verses as we consider what he says

00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:38.179
to this church.

00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:45.760
It is not called the church of Laodicea, it is called the church of the Laodiceans.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.599
And there is a distinction there, by the way.

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:54.599
Notice it in verse number 14, and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:39:05.799
But notice with me in verse number 20 of chapter number 3, behold, I, who is speaking, Jesus.

00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:11.440
These are the letters that are given to the churches in Asia, these seven churches.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.239
This is the church of the Laodiceans.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:19.880
Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.799
If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will sup with him

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:30.340
and he with me.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.440
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.799
and am set down with my father in his throne.

00:39:37.799 --> 00:39:45.979
Then we see this repeated phrase in verse number 22, he that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:39:45.979 --> 00:39:48.200
He that hath an ear, let him hear.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.280
Notice with me in verse number 20 as we've read the verse of Scripture, that the Bible

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.000
says behold, I stand at the door and knock.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.559
The imagery that is given to us here in this text of Scripture is that the church of the

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:01.919
Laodiceans.

00:40:01.919 --> 00:40:06.399
that the Lord Jesus Christ is on the outside of his church. You understand

00:40:06.399 --> 00:40:10.759
that the church is the pillar and ground of truth, but the church is his church.

00:40:10.759 --> 00:40:15.559
Remember Jesus said in the book of Matthew, I will build my church and the

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:18.559
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. We understand that the church

00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:22.239
according to Acts chapter number 20 that Jesus Christ bought it with his own

00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:26.239
blood. We understand the Bible tells us that husbands are to love their wives

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:31.599
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it in the book of Ephesians.

00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:36.279
And we find here that God owns the church, the Lord Jesus Christ, he

00:40:36.279 --> 00:40:40.799
instituted the church, and here in chapter number three, a church that is

00:40:40.799 --> 00:40:46.279
full of goods. The Bible says that this is how God describes them.

00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:50.599
Excuse me, this is how they are described here. Notice it says, because thou sayest,

00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:54.639
this is what they say of themselves, I am rich and increased with goods and have

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:59.039
need of nothing. And God says, but you know not that thou art wretched,

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:08.839
miserable, poor, blind, and naked. They're having a little club. It's the church of

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:14.279
the Laodiceans. And the imagery that God gives us in verse number 20 is that

00:41:14.279 --> 00:41:20.879
Jesus is on the outside of his church and he's knocking. He's knocking on the

00:41:20.879 --> 00:41:25.959
door of the church. And the Bible says, then I stand at the door and knock. You

00:41:25.959 --> 00:41:33.959
notice that God does not force himself in. You remember when Peter was knocking

00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:36.919
on the door when they were praying for him in Acts chapter number 12?

00:41:36.919 --> 00:41:41.679
Rhoda was excited, wasn't she? But she forgot to do something. She forgot to

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:47.879
open the door! Right? She says, it's Peter! He's knocking on the door! What did they

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:54.159
say? You're mad. You're crazy. That's what they say to her. It's his spirit. And she's

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:58.639
like, no! He's knocking! And eventually they open the door and Peter's able to go in and

00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:02.959
he tells them some things. He shares how God had miraculously answered their

00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:09.639
prayers and delivered him from prison. Read it in Acts 12. Here we find that Jesus is

00:42:09.639 --> 00:42:13.719
knocking on the door of his church and as he's knocking there, he says, I stand at

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:18.559
the door and knock. Notice what it says, if any man hear my voice, notice, and open

00:42:18.759 --> 00:42:24.159
the door. Would you allow me this morning to make an application from what we see

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:28.599
in 1 Samuel chapter number 3 when Samuel is there and he's hearing the voice of

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:34.079
God and he hears Samuel and he runs to Eli and says, here am I! You've called! And

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:39.479
Eli says, I haven't called you. Go back to sleep. Go back to bed. And Eli goes back

00:42:39.479 --> 00:42:43.679
to bed and he hears, excuse me, Samuel goes back to bed and he hears Samuel and he

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:50.719
runs into Eli again and says, you've called! Here am I! I haven't called you. Go

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:58.399
back to sleep. And on that third time, Eli perceives it's the Lord. And he says,

00:42:58.399 --> 00:43:06.239
Samuel, when you hear it again, here's what you need to say. Speak, Lord, for thy

00:43:06.399 --> 00:43:13.399
servant heareth. What good counsel. We find that Samuel followed that counsel and the

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:22.559
Lord came that fourth time and said, Samuel, Samuel. And he said, speak, for thy servant

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:30.839
heareth. And the Lord said unto Samuel. It tells us here in Revelation chapter number

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:37.199
3 and verse number 20 that if any man hear my voice and open the door, notice what it

00:43:37.199 --> 00:43:44.199
says, I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me. You know, he desires to

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:55.079
have fellowship with you. He desires to speak to you. In fact, he's waiting for you to enter

00:43:55.599 --> 00:44:02.599
into his presence to invite him to speak to you. To say as you would get into a quiet

00:44:03.279 --> 00:44:08.559
place and open up the precious Word of God and as you open this precious book and you

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:13.599
say, Lord, open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. But

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:19.719
Lord, would you speak for my servant heareth. I mean, I want to know who you are and I want

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:24.919
to know what you've done. But I want you to speak to me. I want you to show me how to

00:44:24.919 --> 00:44:31.279
be a better father, a better mother, a better husband, a better wife, a better son or daughter,

00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:36.359
a better church member, a better pastor. God speaks to me. God gives us instruction on

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:40.239
all of those things that I just mentioned. Maybe you want to be a better employee. Maybe

00:44:40.239 --> 00:44:47.239
you want to be a better employer. God speaks about those things as well. We say, God, speak

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:54.519
for thy servant heareth. We go to the Word of God. And as we make application this morning

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:59.799
and look at this principle for today, we can rejoice in understanding that still to this

00:44:59.799 --> 00:45:06.799
very hour, God is desiring to speak to His servants. Are you hearing the voice of God?

00:45:11.719 --> 00:45:18.719
Are you spending time in this precious book? Are you allowing the Word of God to permeate

00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:26.079
into your soul? To impact your behavior? To have faith in what God has said? To understand

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:35.199
that He has given us, He has taught us things that must shortly come to pass. That just

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:41.759
as He revealed to Samuel in 1 Samuel chapter number 3, these things concerning future judgment

00:45:41.759 --> 00:45:46.479
that would come upon the house of Eli, that God has given us in His Word truth regarding

00:45:46.479 --> 00:45:53.479
future events. And we go to His Word and we say, speak for thy servant heareth. But

00:45:56.479 --> 00:46:03.479
that attitude is critical. It is a critical attitude that we have that we come to God

00:46:04.279 --> 00:46:11.279
and we say, Lord, would you speak to me? Would you give me truth? And would you help me to

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:17.239
respond to that truth? Would you help me to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only?

00:46:17.239 --> 00:46:23.239
Would you help me to put in practice that which you've given me in your Word? I don't

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:28.399
just want to soak it all in. I want to be a conduit. I want to learn the Word of God.

00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:33.239
I want you to teach me some things and then I can share that with others. And I can have

00:46:33.239 --> 00:46:40.239
an understanding of the times in which we're living. See, God has graciously given us His

00:46:40.559 --> 00:46:47.559
Word. But He doesn't make you read it. No one's going to force you to read the Bible.

00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:52.399
Now maybe if you're a child here this morning, you say, my parents forced me to read the

00:46:52.399 --> 00:46:59.399
Bible. Be thankful for that. Honestly. Because they would help you to develop a walk with

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:07.239
God. I'll never forget the day in which I sat in our house in Manassas and when our

00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:11.699
children were younger, of course we'd read the Bible to them. And we still to this day

00:47:11.699 --> 00:47:18.359
have family devotions together, all of us. And we would encourage our children as they

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:24.159
got a little older to read the Bible for themselves. And learn to read the Bible. Learn to study

00:47:24.159 --> 00:47:29.479
the Bible. One year for Christmas, one of our children, they would come to me regularly

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:33.199
and ask me, what does this word mean? What does that word mean? It was encouraging to

00:47:33.799 --> 00:47:37.559
me. It's encouraging when my children say, I was reading the Bible, what does this mean?

00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:41.799
Right now we've done various things in our family devotions, but right now as a family,

00:47:41.799 --> 00:47:48.519
each month we're reading through the book of Proverbs, individually. Today is August

00:47:48.519 --> 00:47:52.799
8th, and so we'll be reading Proverbs chapter number 8 individually. And we have family

00:47:52.799 --> 00:47:58.639
devotions tonight. We each will share, what did God show you? How did God speak to you

00:47:58.759 --> 00:48:03.479
through Proverbs 8 today? And undoubtedly, Tim, somebody's going to say, that was my

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:09.919
verse! Because God used that verse in their life. And undoubtedly, I want to go first,

00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:12.799
I want to go first, can I go first? Because I don't want anyone to take my verse, that

00:48:12.799 --> 00:48:19.799
kind of a thing. But it's exciting. We're trying to help them, but I'll never forget

00:48:19.959 --> 00:48:26.959
when I was sitting on the couch in Manassas and we'd ask the children, did you read your

00:48:26.959 --> 00:48:33.039
Bible today? And I remember Joseph was walking upstairs one day, and I was sitting there

00:48:33.039 --> 00:48:36.479
in the living room, and many of you were at our house in Manassas, and you know the layout.

00:48:36.479 --> 00:48:40.279
And he kind of, as he would walk up the stairs, he could see right where I was sitting. And

00:48:40.279 --> 00:48:47.279
he looked at me and he said, hey daddy, did you read your Bible today? You know, I was

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:56.039
thankful to be able to say, yes I did. And to share how God had spoken to my family.

00:48:56.959 --> 00:49:01.919
God had opened my heart that day. But can I tell you this morning that we shouldn't

00:49:01.919 --> 00:49:07.440
just read our Bibles because somebody might ask us if we read our Bible today? God wants

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:14.440
to speak to you. He wants to speak to you. He's given you this perfect, preserved Word

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:22.839
of God. It's profitable for us. It's a probing book. Amen? It's a piercing book. It's a

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.519
proving book. And we get into it and we say, speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. Oh, would

00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:39.799
you teach me truth from your Word? I'm so thankful you've given it. But the principle

00:49:39.799 --> 00:49:46.799
that we look at this morning is just as God was seeking to speak to Samuel, today God's

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:52.599
desiring to speak to you. Maybe you're saying, man, it's been a long time since I've heard

00:49:52.599 --> 00:49:58.479
the voice of God. Maybe I've neglected reading the Word of God. I think it was Brianna and

00:49:58.479 --> 00:50:01.839
her testimony a couple of weeks ago after coming from camp and maybe it was one of the

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:01.959
other days.

00:50:01.959 --> 00:50:05.879
teenagers. I don't remember for sure. I didn't jot it down. But they made a

00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:10.039
statement about one of the things that Pastor Michael Jones said during his

00:50:10.039 --> 00:50:17.159
message that many believers respect the Bible. Have any of you said that? And that if any of

00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:21.679
us were to throw the Bible on the ground, oh what's going on? You know we respect

00:50:21.679 --> 00:50:28.239
the Bible. And that pastor said at teen camp that many of God's people respect

00:50:28.239 --> 00:50:36.999
the Bible, but only a few read the Bible. Statistics come out every year. I've

00:50:36.999 --> 00:50:42.279
never been called and asked, so I'm not sure who has been polled. But statistics

00:50:42.279 --> 00:50:49.399
are coming out all the time of how often people that claim to be followers of

00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:55.119
Jesus Christ read their Bible. You know there are very few in the whole of

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:59.359
Christendom, however you want to cut that up and dice it up, that have ever

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:08.799
read the Bible cover to cover. God wants to speak. God desired to speak to Samuel.

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:18.759
God had something to tell Samuel. But Samuel had to say, speak Lord for thy

00:51:18.759 --> 00:51:26.599
servant heareth. This morning, oh that a whole bunch of us would just say, speak

00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:34.119
Lord for thy servant heareth. I don't want to just go through the motions of

00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:39.919
checking a list of, I read my Bible today, but I desire that God would speak to me.

00:51:39.919 --> 00:51:49.399
Give me truth. Help me in my walk with Him. Speak Lord for thy servant heareth.

00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:58.479
Let's pray. Father, we're so thankful this morning for your Word, the precious Bible.

00:51:59.479 --> 00:52:16.239
We sing songs about the Bible. We claim to believe the Bible. We have discussions with

00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:25.159
people about the Bible. God, we're so thankful that you've given us this book and that you

00:52:25.159 --> 00:52:33.399
desire to speak to us. And I pray that this morning, in the quietness of the moment, that

00:52:33.399 --> 00:52:40.339
you would help us as your servants to respond in the same fashion in which Samuel responded.

00:52:40.339 --> 00:52:50.559
And we would say, speak Lord for thy servant heareth. As we consider the message to each

00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:57.639
of the churches in Asia, there in Revelation 2, in verse number 3, he that hath an ear,

00:52:57.639 --> 00:53:08.239
let him hear. You stand at the door and knock. If any man will hear and open, oh God, I pray

00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:17.999
that we would enjoy that rich fellowship with you around your Word and in prayer. Speak

00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:24.919
to our hearts. Give us confidence in what thy Word says. Help us to understand those

00:53:24.919 --> 00:53:31.559
things which must shortly come to pass. We pray, God, that if there'd be one that's present,

00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:38.919
not sure of heaven, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation. For each

00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:45.559
of us that have trusted you as Lord and Savior, I pray that we'd have a renewed commitment

00:53:45.559 --> 00:53:56.879
with regard to our walk with thee, specifically with regard to our Bible reading. As we look

00:53:56.879 --> 00:54:03.399
at this Old Testament account and make application in our lives today, that we'd be challenged

00:54:03.399 --> 00:54:10.119
and that we would say, speak Lord for thy servant heareth. Would you move and work as

00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:14.479
only you can, and we'll give you the glory for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you

00:54:14.479 --> 00:54:19.999
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around. Kimberly's

00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:26.359
going to play quietly on the piano. Give you an opportunity to respond, an invitation.

00:54:26.359 --> 00:54:29.159
Maybe you want to make your pew an altar. Maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned

00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:35.119
altar. Maybe you just need to come and say, as Samuel said, speak for thy servant heareth.

00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:42.439
Renew that commitment, desiring, understanding that God desires to speak to you, but desiring

00:54:42.439 --> 00:54:46.039
to hear from him. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
