1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
Genesis chapter number 14, and be looking at verses 17 through 24 this evening, Genesis

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:09,199
chapter number 14, and be looking at verses 17 through 24.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,559
If you're taking notes this evening, I have titled the message, Abram Met Melchizedek.

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,620
There's actually two kings that he meets in this particular text of scripture.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,879
He meets the king of Sodom, and he also meets Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,600
And as we look at the passage of scripture, we'll be reminded from looking at the first

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,520
section of Genesis chapter number 14 last Sunday evening, that the Lord provides us

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,439
with a record of a battle that took place in the Vale of Sidon.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,439
As we spoke about that particular battle, and we looked at the verse, really verse 1

10
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:50,360
through 16 last Sunday, and we began to understand the size of this battle, the seriousness of

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,360
this battle, we dealt with the fact that they took Lot.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,000
Lot, of course, at that particular time, was dwelling in Sodom.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,760
No longer did he just have his tent pitched toward Sodom, he's now living, dwelling in

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Sodom.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
And we find that the Bible tells us that they took Lot and all of his goods, and of course

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,879
at that time, Abram became involved in this particular battle.

17
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,680
And the Bible gives us this truth in verse number 16, it reveals to us that Abram had

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,319
complete victory.

19
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,160
They returned all the goods, Lot, his goods, the women and the people.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,239
Notice the Bible says, speaking of Abram in verse number 16 of Genesis 14, and he brought

21
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:37,559
back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women

22
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:40,599
also, and the people.

23
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,760
We learned two important lessons last week as we looked at those first 16 verses.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,559
One lesson we learned from the life of Lot, and that was that we need to be careful of

25
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,559
our influences.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,120
We need to be careful of the way in which we begin to allow ourselves to be exposed

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,800
to wickedness and become desensitized to wickedness, and the way in which the enemy works, and

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,360
we spoke about that last Sunday evening.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,880
We also learned a lesson from the life of Abram, and we spoke about the fact that he

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,440
was engaged here in a physical battle, but we are engaged in a spiritual battle.

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,639
We look at the fact that Abram had complete victory in this physical battle that he was

32
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,759
engaged in, and we only can have victory in this spiritual battle as we go in the power

33
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,039
of the Lord, as we put on the whole armor of God, as we understand that we wrestle not

34
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,000
against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,880
We sought to learn those lessons last week, and as we look further into the 14th chapter

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,160
of the book of Genesis and really finish it up this evening, and we look at the record

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,639
of these meetings that Abram has, I believe, again, that we find here within the pages

38
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,199
of Scripture some very important lessons for us.

39
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,320
Notice in verse number 17, the Bible says,

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,160
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, who's him, it's Abram, after his return

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,039
from the slaughter of Shador Laomer, and of the kings that were with him, the valley

42
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,080
of Shavah, which is the king's dale.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
And notice verse 18,

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,960
Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,679
most high God.

46
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,039
And he blessed him, and said,

47
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:34,600
Blessed be Abram, of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,199
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.

49
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,080
And he gave him tithes of all.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,279
The king of Sodom said unto Abram,

51
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:51,119
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

52
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,080
And Abram said to the king of Sodom,

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,080
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:06,000
earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,839
take anything that is thine, lest thou shouldst say, I have made Abram rich.

56
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:18,799
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with

57
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,720
me, Aner, Eshgal, and Mamre, let them take their portion.

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,160
As we look at this text of Scripture, I want you to notice with me, first of all, if you're

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,880
taking notes, the significance of the meeting.

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,519
It's very interesting as we look at the passage of Scripture, and I read the entirety of it

61
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,720
this evening so that we'd kind of get a flow of what's taking place, but it's very interesting

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,640
that as you begin reading this portion of Scripture, that you find in verse number 17

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,279
that the Bible says that the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from

64
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,279
the slaughter.

65
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,760
We find that the Bible tells us that this king of Sodom, he goes out with the express

66
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,399
purpose of meeting Abram.

67
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,200
Abram is coming back from a great victory.

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,540
We've already dealt with that in our previous study as we looked at the first 16 verses

69
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,920
of this chapter, and we find now that the king of Sodom comes and he desires to meet

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
with Abram.

71
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,480
Now, it's interesting, we understand if you go back to chapter number 13 and look at verse

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,160
number 13, that the Bible says that the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the

73
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Lord exceedingly.

74
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,640
Now we do not know a whole lot about this king of Sodom, in fact his name is not even

75
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,839
provided to us in the text of Scripture, but we do find that if he is the king of such

76
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,559
a wicked people, that it would not be too far of a stretch to say that he himself was

77
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,559
wicked.

78
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,559
Amen?

79
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:44,480
And so we find that this wicked man, this king of Sodom, he's coming and he has this

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,720
desire to meet with Abram, but right as we're looking at the passage of Scripture, we find

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,239
that the king of Salem, Melchizedek, first meets with Abram.

82
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:00,000
The Bible tells us in verse number 17 that the king of Sodom goes out for the purpose

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,559
of meeting with Abram, but as we look at the passage, the Bible says in verse 18, and Melchizedek,

84
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,899
king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine.

85
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,920
You do not see any more reference to the king of Sodom until verse number 21.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:20,079
And so God divinely orchestrated this meeting and the timing of this meeting so that Abram

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,320
would be properly prepared to have this meeting with the king of Sodom.

88
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,200
Before he would meet with the king of Sodom, he meets with Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,440
You note in the Scriptures the intent of this king of Sodom, and you note as we get into

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,880
the passage and start reading in verse number 21 and following the purpose of his desire

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,359
to meet with Abram, but you find that this one, Melchizedek, almost slips in, if you

92
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:58,320
will, if we could use the picture this evening, he slips in just ahead of the king of Sodom

93
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,119
and he has a time of meeting with Abram.

94
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:06,799
And it's so significant to see this meeting that takes place.

95
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:12,600
We, of course, as we studied through the book of Hebrews, we spent some time several weeks

96
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,480
ago, actually a couple of months ago at this point, dealing with Hebrews chapter number

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
seven and looking at Melchizedek.

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,920
If you turn over, hold your place here in Genesis 14, and turn over to the book of Hebrews,

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,399
if you will, I just want to make a few statements from Hebrews chapter number seven with regard

100
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,679
to this one, Melchizedek.

101
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:37,679
As I mentioned as I preached through Hebrews chapter number seven, really if Hebrews did

102
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:41,679
not give us some insight, there's a verse of scripture in Psalm 110 in verse number

103
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,480
four, but really this meeting in Genesis chapter number 14, for some of us, maybe we would

104
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,640
just briefly read over it and not really hold too much significance in our minds, but we

105
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,359
find that this was a significant meeting and then we see how that Melchizedek is an Old

106
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,859
Testament type of Christ.

107
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:05,839
Notice in verse number one of Hebrews seven, the Bible says, for this Melchizedek, king

108
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,559
of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of

109
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:18,399
the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all.

110
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,019
First being by interpretation, notice, king of righteousness, and after that also king

111
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,519
of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having

112
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:34,599
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth

113
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,280
a priest continually.

114
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,219
You remember that we find in the scriptures that as we would be reading the book of Hebrews

115
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,960
and studying the portion that this text is found in, that the writer of Hebrews is presenting

116
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,719
the Lord Jesus Christ in his priesthood as being superior to that of the Levitical or

117
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,700
the Aaronic priesthood.

118
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,599
And as we begin to see that he's of a greater, a higher order, he's after the order of Melchizedek,

119
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:09,119
and we saw and studied in this passage and begin to see the descriptive terms that are

120
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,799
given in these first three verses of Hebrews chapter number seven.

121
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,719
Now go back to Hebrews chapter, or excuse me, to Genesis chapter number 14, and notice

122
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:22,640
here in the text of Scripture what God tells us about this meeting.

123
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,559
We see some of the description, we find here that he was, he's the king of Salem according

124
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:36,000
to verse number 18, the king of Salem, which many believe to become Jerusalem later, and

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the king of peace.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,599
We find at the end of verse number 18 it says that he was the priest of the Most High God.

127
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,359
Remember that he was a priest and king.

128
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:48,919
We speak about the Lord Jesus Christ being prophet, priest, and king.

129
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,520
And we find that this Melchizedek, he was a king and he was a priest.

130
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,320
And we notice the meeting, and I want you to consider the fellowship that they had here

131
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,380
at this meeting.

132
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,940
In verse number 18, Ismael...

133
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,520
Melchizedek kind of cuts off the king of Sodom

134
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,940
and comes to meet with Abram.

135
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,680
The Bible tells us in v. 18

136
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,600
that Melchizedek, notice it says,

137
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,180
Melchizedek, king of Salem,

138
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,520
brought forth bread and wine.

139
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,140
Bread and wine.

140
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
As we begin to think about the fellowship

141
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,800
that they would enjoy here

142
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,260
at this particular meeting,

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,760
and we think about the significance

144
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
of these two items that are mentioned,

145
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
the bread and the wine,

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,100
and we understand the significance

147
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,440
of these elements biblically,

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,540
we begin to think about as New Testament believers

149
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,200
and begin to consider the way

150
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,140
in which God has given the church

151
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,240
the two ordinances,

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,860
that of baptism and the second is the Lord's Supper,

153
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,500
and we think about the Lord's Supper

154
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,260
and how we have the bread and the wine.

155
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,420
We understand that contextually,

156
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,580
and we've spent entire message on this in the past,

157
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,820
that it's unfermented wine.

158
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,520
You can always find in the Scriptures,

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,540
contextually, whether it's speaking

160
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,160
of an alcoholic beverage

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,740
or the fruit of the vine.

162
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,160
And here as we begin to see this

163
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,779
and we understand the picture biblically

164
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,779
and the typology and the significance,

165
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,720
how the bread, remember what Jesus says

166
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,620
is we would consider the Lord's Supper

167
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,779
and we'd consider the instruction of Paul

168
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,139
in 1 Corinthians 11,

169
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,220
the bread, why?

170
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,380
For the body of the Lord Jesus Christ

171
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,500
that's broken.

172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
The wine or the juice, why?

173
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,540
For the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

174
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,580
His perfect blood that was shed.

175
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,580
And we begin to see how that even

176
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
in Genesis chapter number 14,

177
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,420
with this meeting with Melchizedek,

178
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,020
this Old Testament type of Christ,

179
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,940
how that they have this wine and this bread

180
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,200
and how significant that is

181
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,560
to how the Old Testament looked forward to Calvary.

182
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,000
See, we think about the Bible

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,980
and we understand that as we look at the Bible

184
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,380
that yes, there is much history

185
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,080
that is contained within the Old Testament.

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,020
In fact, as we've studied throughout

187
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,779
some of these pages of Genesis,

188
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,139
as you study throughout various books

189
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:04,980
of the Old Testament,

190
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,020
you see the historical nature of these things.

191
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,139
But we understand that the theme of the Bible

192
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,020
is redemption and the main character

193
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,979
of the Bible is the Lord Jesus Christ.

194
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:16,540
And we find that the Old Testament

195
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,699
is pointing to the day in which Messiah would come.

196
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,300
And these Old Testament Bible characters,

197
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,900
by faith, they looked forward

198
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,699
to the day that Messiah would come.

199
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,100
And here we see even in the meeting

200
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,260
that Abram had with Melchizedek,

201
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,220
how that he brought forth this King of Salem,

202
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,339
this Old Testament type of Christ.

203
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,460
He brought the bread and the wine.

204
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,020
What fellowship they must have enjoyed.

205
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,559
I notice not only the significance of this meeting

206
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,580
because of the fellowship,

207
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,699
but I consider the instruction

208
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,820
that Abram received during this meeting.

209
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,020
I want you to notice in verse number 18

210
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,940
that the Bible says that he was the priest

211
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,339
of the Most High God.

212
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,300
You see that phrase, the Most High God.

213
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,380
You notice again in verse number 19,

214
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,900
the Bible says that he, speaking of Melchizedek,

215
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,619
blessed him, speaking of Abram,

216
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,940
and said, blessed be Abram.

217
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Notice again, you see the phrase of the Most High God.

218
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,540
Possessor of heaven and earth.

219
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,660
You see in verse number 20,

220
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,660
and blessed be the Most High God.

221
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,500
You find in verse number 22,

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,040
as Abram is now responding to the King of Sodom,

223
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,059
he says, I have lift up mine hand

224
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,419
unto the Lord, the Most High God.

225
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,960
The Possessor of heaven and earth.

226
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,540
That term, the Most High God,

227
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,979
or that name, it's really a compound name,

228
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,300
El Elyon, it's a Hebrew word.

229
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,020
It's really the first mention in all of the Scriptures

230
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,020
of this name of God, the Most High God.

231
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,260
And you find that as Melchizedek would meet with Abram

232
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,779
and he begins to give some instruction,

233
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,820
he greets him in the name of the Most High God.

234
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,220
Now think about the impact and understand,

235
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,820
as we have the Scriptures,

236
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,380
and perhaps you can think back to the time

237
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,019
in which you first came to Christ

238
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,220
and first began discipleship

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,540
and learning the Scriptures

240
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,100
and how you would read of maybe in theology

241
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,399
of the names of God and the significance

242
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,779
of the names of God

243
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,380
and how God through His names reveals His character.

244
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,700
Well, think of Abraham, Abram here,

245
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,119
his name's not yet been changed,

246
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,339
but you think of Abram as he's receiving these greetings,

247
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,059
he's receiving this instruction,

248
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,660
and the Bible says that he speaks to him

249
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,260
in this terminology, the name, the Most High God.

250
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,420
I want you to know this evening

251
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,860
that he is the Most High God.

252
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,299
There's none like him.

253
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,940
And Abram, in this meeting,

254
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,500
remember I mentioned by way of introduction

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,600
that God divinely orchestrated the meeting

256
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,940
and the timing of the meeting

257
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,540
that Abraham would be prepared properly

258
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,500
for the meeting that he would have with the King of Sodom.

259
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,420
And we find that there's some fellowship,

260
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,739
but I see the instruction

261
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,380
and I find how that Melchizedek comes to him

262
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,399
in the name of the Most High God.

263
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,420
Notice he continues and says this in verse number 19,

264
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,059
the possessor of heaven and earth.

265
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,619
God is the owner.

266
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:34,140
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

267
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,059
Now again, I want you to consider

268
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,799
the significance of this truth

269
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,980
and understand the impact that this revelation

270
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,820
would have upon Abram in this particular moment in his life.

271
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,619
And maybe for some of us this evening,

272
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,339
we say, yeah, we know that he's the Most High God.

273
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,339
Yeah, we know that he's the possessor of heaven and earth.

274
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,500
Do we live like it?

275
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,459
Do we live like he's the Most High God?

276
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,580
Do we live like he's the possessor of heaven and earth?

277
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,899
And here Abram is now receiving this revelation

278
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,580
and he's understanding more about this God

279
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,420
that he's followed and he's serving.

280
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,019
And we understand that God had called him

281
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,660
as you look back in Genesis 11,

282
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,980
and he called him out of the earth of Chaldeas

283
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,540
and Abram is following him

284
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,660
and he's learning more about this God that he's serving.

285
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,700
He says he's the Most High God.

286
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,700
He says he's the possessor of heaven and earth.

287
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,860
Exodus 9, look at a few verses of Scripture with me if you will.

288
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,980
In Exodus 9, we're right in the midst of the plagues

289
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,420
in Egypt land.

290
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,619
In fact, in this particular text,

291
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:44,899
we're looking at the seventh plague, that of Hale.

292
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,739
We won't read the entirety of it,

293
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,140
but I want you to see how that God would use Moses

294
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,339
to help Pharaoh and the Egyptians

295
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,220
understand that the earth is the Lord's,

296
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,779
that He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

297
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,179
Look at verse 29 of Exodus 9.

298
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:03,140
The Bible says,

299
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,459
God said unto him,

300
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,459
as soon as I am gone out of the city,

301
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,339
I will spread abroad My hands unto the Lord.

302
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,140
And the thunder shall cease,

303
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,580
neither shall there be any more hail,

304
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,660
that thou mayest know

305
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,739
how that the earth is the Lord's.

306
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,899
God is revealing His power

307
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,059
through the plagues,

308
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,299
and of course, we understand contextually

309
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,100
of what's happening in Egypt land

310
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,619
and how Pharaoh had that perspective.

311
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,059
I don't even know who your God is.

312
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,179
And God begins to reveal Himself

313
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,339
and God demonstrates His power through these plagues.

314
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,220
And now, as Moses is going to depart

315
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,899
after this seventh plague,

316
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,339
he says, I'm gonna leave the city,

317
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm gonna spread my hands unto the Lord,

318
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,220
and the thunder's gonna cease,

319
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,739
there should be no more hail,

320
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,459
that you, Pharaoh, that you may know

321
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,500
how that the earth is the Lord's.

322
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,660
We find in the book of Deuteronomy,

323
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,580
chapter number 10,

324
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,500
it was important for the children of Israel

325
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
to understand this truth.

326
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,820
We find that here in the book of Deuteronomy

327
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,940
as you would look at the entirety of the book

328
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,140
and the preparation for the people of God

329
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,420
as they would go in to possess

330
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,820
the land of promise,

331
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,980
and Moses, of course, would not be permitted

332
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,220
to lead the people of God

333
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,779
into the land of promise,

334
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,779
and we understand, however,

335
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,940
that God would use Moses to prepare them

336
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,580
for the entrance into the land of promise.

337
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,979
We understand that they would face

338
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,619
a great number of difficulties,

339
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,419
there would be opposition

340
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,340
as they would enter into the land of promise,

341
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,020
and throughout the book of Deuteronomy,

342
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,580
God is using Moses to encourage the people,

343
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,979
to equip the people, to prepare the people

344
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,179
for that which they would face.

345
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,220
Notice in verse number 12 of Deuteronomy,

346
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,340
chapter number 10,

347
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,659
and now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God

348
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,099
require of thee?

349
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,500
But to fear the Lord thy God,

350
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,820
to walk in all His ways,

351
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
and to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy God

352
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,859
with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

353
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,500
to keep the commandments of the Lord

354
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,659
and His statutes which I command thee this day

355
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,979
for thy good.

356
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,299
You understand it's for your good.

357
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,099
It's for my good.

358
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:14,940
Amen?

359
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
Notice verse 14.

360
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,500
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens

361
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,940
is the Lord's thy God.

362
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,940
The earth also with all that therein is.

363
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,739
God is the owner.

364
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,979
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

365
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,580
The psalmist declares in Psalm 24,

366
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,419
in verse number one,

367
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,299
we find that he will make this declaration

368
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,700
with regard to this truth

369
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,340
that we're looking at this evening.

370
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,140
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,

371
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,179
the world, and they that dwell therein.

372
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,500
Paul would later say in the book of 1 Corinthians

373
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,859
in chapter number 10,

374
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:59,179
as he's speaking here to this carnal church

375
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,340
in the New Testament.

376
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,340
We find that he's giving them some instruction,

377
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,620
and he says to them in 1 Corinthians 10,

378
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,540
in verse number 26,

379
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,380
for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.

380
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,500
In verse number 28,

381
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,880
but if any man say unto you,

382
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,800
this is offered in sacrifice unto idols,

383
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,540
eat not for his sake that showed it,

384
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,760
and for conscience sake,

385
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,600
for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.

386
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,720
Now understand with me as we go back

387
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,560
to Genesis chapter number 14,

388
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,340
that God is preparing Abram for this meeting

389
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,180
that's going to happen between he and the king of Sodom.

390
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,880
And before he's ever going to have this meeting

391
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,920
with the king of Sodom,

392
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,300
there's this meeting with the king of Salem, Melchizedek,

393
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
and there's some fellowship that takes place.

394
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,680
There's some instruction that is given.

395
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,560
He says, listen,

396
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,260
I come in the name of the most high God, El Elyon.

397
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,180
He says to him that he is the possessor of heaven and earth.

398
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,440
And then back in Genesis chapter number 14,

399
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
notice in verse number 20,

400
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,560
the Bible says,

401
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,220
and blessed be the most high God,

402
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,820
notice this, which hath delivered thine enemies

403
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,180
into thy hand.

404
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,440
What's Abram being instructed on?

405
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,400
It was God that gave the victory.

406
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,520
It was God that gave the victory.

407
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,400
We mentioned that last week as we studied

408
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,060
the portion of Scripture in Genesis 14,

409
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,520
verses one through 16.

410
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,640
And we dealt with the fact how that Abram,

411
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,900
after he was made aware of the situation

412
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,140
that Lot had been taken,

413
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,680
that he takes his trained servants, 318,

414
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
according to verse number 14,

415
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,020
and pursued after them and he smote them.

416
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,520
But we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

417
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
and God gives us some insight

418
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,140
as to this victory that was wrought on this day,

419
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,220
that the Bible says that it was God that gave the victory.

420
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,600
It was the most high God,

421
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,220
the possessor of heaven and earth.

422
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,980
It was this God, Abram, that you're serving,

423
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,900
that you're following.

424
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,900
It is He which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

425
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
See, Abram had to understand

426
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,560
some things with regard to that

427
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,180
which he had experienced.

428
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,900
You know, it is possible that we could have victory

429
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,600
and we somehow get full of ourselves.

430
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,780
Begin to think that it was something in our power,

431
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,060
it was something in our approach,

432
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,660
it was something in our wit

433
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,300
that allowed us to have the victory.

434
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,580
In fact, if you were to look at the book of Judges

435
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,820
and you would understand that

436
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,140
which takes place with Gideon

437
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,960
and you understand that in Judges 7,

438
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,740
very interesting insight that God gives us

439
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,220
with regard to the battle that Gideon would be

440
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,100
the human instrument that God would use

441
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,300
to go against this great host.

442
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,180
And we find that in verse number 2 of Judges 7,

443
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
notice what God says to Gideon.

444
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,020
It says,

445
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
The Lord said unto Gideon,

446
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,100
the people that are with thee are too many.

447
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,220
They are too many for me to give

448
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,660
the Midianites into their hands.

449
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,300
Now you understand, at this particular time,

450
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,300
even with the number of people that Gideon had,

451
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,260
he was still far outnumbered.

452
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,700
But God says, Gideon, you have too many.

453
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,060
I cannot give you the victory

454
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,060
with this number of people and here's why.

455
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,740
Lest Israel vaunt themselves against me,

456
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,560
saying, mine own hand hath saved me.

457
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,700
So what does God say?

458
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,500
He says, I'm gonna make it such

459
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,060
that the only thing that you can explain

460
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,880
is that God gave us the victory.

461
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,460
I'm going to decrease your numbers so significantly

462
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,340
that there would be no other explanation

463
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,380
for the victory that I'm going to give you

464
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,940
than to say God did it.

465
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,460
See, God understands.

466
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,620
He's the Creator.

467
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,820
He's made us and He understands

468
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,380
that we sometimes as human beings

469
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,740
can get to the place that we get

470
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,260
a little full of ourselves.

471
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,380
And we think that we've accomplished something,

472
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,660
that we've done something.

473
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,500
And Jesus said, without me, you can do nothing.

474
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,620
In John 15.

475
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,420
And so Abram in this meeting with Melchizedek

476
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,220
as they are having this meeting,

477
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,340
we find that he's receiving some instruction.

478
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,780
He's gaining a better understanding of who God is.

479
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,580
The Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

480
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,980
He's gaining a little bit of a greater understanding

481
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
of what God does.

482
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,620
Not only who He is, but what He does.

483
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,420
By the way, it's good for us to continually

484
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,580
allow ourselves to be developed in our understanding

485
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,780
of who God is and what God does.

486
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,220
It's important for us to understand theology.

487
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,940
It's important for us to understand

488
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,260
the God that we serve

489
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,380
and that we would be students of the Word of God,

490
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,500
that we would be instructed through the pages of Scripture,

491
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,260
that we would understand the way in which God works.

492
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,340
And here, Melchizedek in no uncertain terms

493
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,100
lets Abram understand that it was God

494
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,540
that delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

495
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,860
The battle that took place,

496
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,780
remember it was four kings with five.

497
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,580
It was a pretty serious battle that took place.

498
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,060
And those kings from the east that came in

499
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,100
that weren't too comfortable

500
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,620
or too excited about the fact

501
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,660
that those other kings had rebelled,

502
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,380
they came in and cleaned house.

503
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,620
And Abram, with the help of God

504
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,460
and his 318 servants,

505
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,260
went and recovered all.

506
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,580
And God allowed Melchizedek.

507
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,700
He orchestrated that this meeting would take place

508
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,820
so that Abram would understand

509
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,700
that he would gain this greater awareness of the fact

510
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,340
that it's God that gives us the victory.

511
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,940
It was God that delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

512
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,300
I think about the many battles

513
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,180
that you can read of throughout the Scriptures.

514
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,740
I think about battles in which

515
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,940
the kings of Judah encountered the enemies.

516
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,420
The kings of Israel encountered the enemies.

517
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,340
And you can see very distinctly

518
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,820
the hand of the Lord

519
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,940
in providing and delivering

520
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,020
and giving the victory.

521
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,500
And here, Abram is given this truth.

522
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,180
We not only consider their time of fellowship,

523
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,500
their time of instruction,

524
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,220
I want you to consider the blessing.

525
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,500
In verses 19 and 20,

526
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
the Bible says at the beginning of v. 19,

527
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,660
and he blessed him.

528
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,180
Melchizedek blessed Abram.

529
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,980
And then we find that in v. 20,

530
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
it says that he, Melchizedek, says,

531
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,220
and blessed be the Most High God.

532
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,900
We notice the response of Abram

533
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,660
to these blessings that are mentioned.

534
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,740
He says, blessed be Abram

535
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,860
of the Most High God,

536
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,540
possessor of heaven and earth.

537
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,260
Blessed be the Most High God

538
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,500
which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

539
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,580
And look at the end of v. 20.

540
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,580
And He gave him tithes of all.

541
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,500
We see again, as we've mentioned already,

542
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,660
that there's a few first mentions.

543
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,860
The book of Genesis is a book of beginnings.

544
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,460
And so, obviously, as you study

545
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,700
through the book of Genesis,

546
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,580
you see a number of first mention principles.

547
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,620
You find the first mention of El Elyon,

548
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,820
the Most High God.

549
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,700
You see the first mention of the possessor

550
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
of heaven and earth.

551
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,820
Now we see the first mention of tithes.

552
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,780
We notice in Hebrews 7,

553
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,620
if you hold your place there in Genesis

554
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,980
and turn back over to the portion in Hebrews,

555
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,820
you find that God speaks of this

556
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,700
in Hebrews 7 as well.

557
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,300
He's speaking about, of course, Abraham

558
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,860
and his interaction with this Melchizedek,

559
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,340
the king of Salem.

560
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,500
This reference in Genesis 14,

561
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,820
the historical account that is given to us there.

562
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,940
And we understand, again,

563
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,260
as we read the book of Hebrews,

564
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,220
these Jewish believers in the first century,

565
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,300
we understand how they would hold Abraham

566
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
in high regard.

567
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,220
And the greatness of Abraham.

568
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,340
He was Father Abraham.

569
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,780
We find that in verse 4 of Hebrews 7,

570
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
it says, now consider how great this man was

571
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,940
unto whom even the patriarch Abraham

572
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,660
gave the tenth of his spoils.

573
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,260
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi

574
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,420
who receive the office of the priesthood

575
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,740
have a commandment to take tithes of the people

576
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,180
according to the law that is of their brethren,

577
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,620
though they come out of the loins of Abraham.

578
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,300
But he whose descent is not counted from them

579
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,660
received tithes of Abraham

580
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,180
and blessed him that had the promises.

581
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,460
It says in verse number eight in here,

582
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,100
men that die receive tithes,

583
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,300
but there he receiveth them

584
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,380
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

585
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,900
And as I may so say,

586
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,660
Levi also who receiveth tithes

587
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,700
paid tithes in Abraham.

588
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,860
So we begin to see in Genesis 14

589
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,460
this record of Abram giving tithes of all

590
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,420
to Melchizedek, this king of Salem again,

591
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,940
this Old Testament type of the Lord Jesus Christ.

592
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,059
And we begin to understand the teaching

593
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,380
throughout the Scriptures with regard to giving

594
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,820
and understanding that giving

595
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,260
is a form of worship.

596
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,180
We need to be careful when we understand

597
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,460
the truth of giving

598
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,100
and we understand the blessedness in giving

599
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,300
and understand that God in the New Testament,

600
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,900
it says that He loves a cheerful giver.

601
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,540
That we'd understand that we worship our God

602
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
through our giving.

603
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,500
And here, Abram recognizing the blessing

604
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,420
and recognizing that which he's dealing with here

605
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,860
in the passage of Scripture,

606
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,340
we find that he gave tithes of all.

607
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,460
So, we look at the significance of this first meeting.

608
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,220
This meeting with the King of Salem.

609
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
This one Melchizedek.

610
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:15,180
We begin to understand how that God in His wisdom is preparing Abram for this second

611
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,660
meeting that we find was intended really to be the initial meeting.

612
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:27,220
Remember in verse number 17, the King of Sodom went out to meet him after his return.

613
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,340
But God orchestrated it so that first, the King of Salem, this Melchizedek, has a meeting

614
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,980
with Abram.

615
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,780
And now, Abram is properly prepared for the meeting that will take place with the King

616
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,420
of Sodom.

617
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,580
We mentioned about the significance of the meeting.

618
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,940
I want you to think about as we look at the latter portion of this chapter, number two

619
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,940
in your notes, the subtlety of the enemy.

620
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,940
You understand the enemy is subtle.

621
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,300
In fact, we're told in Genesis chapter 3, when we understand the events that are recorded

622
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,100
for us with regard to the Garden of Eden and sin entering into the world, that the Bible

623
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,940
tells us of the serpent in verse number 1 of Genesis 3,

624
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,220
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.

625
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,900
And He said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the

626
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
garden.

627
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,260
And we find that He came with great subtlety.

628
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,940
We understand that the Bible tells us that our enemy, in Ephesians chapter number 6,

629
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,200
we're told that we're to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might, put on the

630
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,580
whole armor of God, that we might stand against the wiles of the devil, the subtlety of the

631
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,900
devil, the deceitfulness of the devil.

632
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:48,620
We find in 1 Peter 5 that Peter is giving admonition to those that he is speaking to,

633
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,980
that he's ministering to with regard to the enemy.

634
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,220
And he says he's walking about seeking whom he may devour.

635
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,620
But Paul gives us this great truth in 2 Corinthians 2 in verse number 11, when he says that we

636
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,060
are not ignorant of his devices, speaking of the enemy.

637
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,420
And the reality is that we, as we study the Word of God, as we begin to study the events

638
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:18,740
that God has preserved for us in this precious book, we are able to be informed and aware

639
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,980
of how it is that the enemy works.

640
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,300
Why would we speak this evening about this meeting with this king of Sodom and entitle

641
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,780
it, describe it as being the subtlety of the enemy?

642
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Well, I want you to really, in the very beginning, consider the timing of this meeting.

643
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,060
We look at the purpose as we get into the text, but I want you to consider, as we think

644
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:48,500
about the subtlety, this man, this king of Sodom, he comes with an offer right after

645
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,580
a time of great victory.

646
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,180
See, there are times in which we experience great victory and we experience the blessing

647
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,380
of God, and perhaps our guard can be down.

648
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,980
Because we're experiencing that victory.

649
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,940
In fact, as you study the kings of Israel and Judah, and you would find at times in

650
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,340
their lives that they would experience victory, and shortly thereafter, they would suffer

651
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,140
great defeat.

652
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,940
We need to be careful in time of blessing and time of victory.

653
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,540
And we notice here that the king of Sodom, if you look in verse 17, it says that he went

654
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,500
out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Shador, Laomer, and of the kings

655
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
that were with him.

656
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,120
Now remember, in verse 16, he brought back all the goods.

657
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,940
He brought his brother-in-law and his goods and the women and the people.

658
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,540
There's great victory that had been taking place.

659
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,220
And here comes the king of Sodom.

660
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,780
And he's going to come with an offer.

661
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,580
He's going to come, and we really see the subtlety of the enemy, and we begin to notice

662
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,900
what's taking place.

663
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,940
Notice in verse number 21, we look at his proposition.

664
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
It says this,

665
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:06,940
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

666
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,260
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

667
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,180
I've already made mention that this king of Sodom no doubt was a wicked man.

668
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,900
When we understand the way in which God describes for us the people of Sodom, the men of Sodom,

669
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,340
that they were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly, we very easily can conclude

670
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:33,780
that this man that was the king of Sodom was a vile, wicked man.

671
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,980
And this king of Sodom comes to Abram just after he's experienced great victory.

672
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,980
And he's brought all of these things back.

673
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,620
He's returned all of these things.

674
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
And he's come back.

675
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:51,340
And here the king of Sodom, but before he can hear the proposition of the king of Sodom,

676
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,940
God allows the king of Salem to first have a meeting with Abram.

677
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:04,580
And God in that meeting that Melchizedek has with Abram reveals more of his person, reveals

678
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,420
more of his plan.

679
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,940
And we find that Abram is therefore prepared for the meeting with Sodom.

680
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,420
And when this man, this king of Sodom, gives this proposition, he says,

681
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,540
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

682
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:25,340
Then Abram is able to come to a place where he understands, I don't need what you're offering.

683
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,500
Why? Because I'm serving the great God, the Most High God,

684
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,660
who is the possessor of heaven and earth.

685
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,100
This wicked king of Sodom, I don't need thy goods.

686
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,500
You do understand that he says, Give me the persons, and have the goods.

687
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,420
He's concerned about the people, this king of Sodom.

688
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,740
He's not so concerned about the goods, he's concerned about the persons.

689
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,460
And we understand that no doubt, even at the end of this chapter,

690
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,460
as Abram would give a response to the king of Sodom,

691
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,020
and he would say, No, thank you, that he would return.

692
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:11,180
But we find that Lot would go back to Sodom.

693
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,740
If the king of Salem, Melchizedek, is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

694
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,860
I would say this evening that the king of Sodom is a type of the devil,

695
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,940
is a type of the enemy.

696
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,820
He's wicked, exceedingly vile.

697
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,660
And he comes and he makes this offer, this proposition.

698
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,540
And I love the way in which Abram responds in verse number 22 and 23.

699
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,460
The response continues into verse 24,

700
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,940
but I want you to see what is said in verses 22 and 23,

701
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,980
and really grasp with me this evening how this meeting with Melchizedek

702
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:01,580
properly prepared Abram for the subtlety of the enemy.

703
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,220
It says this,

704
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,140
Abram said to the king of Sodom,

705
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,860
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord.

706
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:21,820
The Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

707
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,300
Now let me ask you this evening,

708
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,940
where is it that Abram discovered that he was the Most High God?

709
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,060
Where was it that Abram discovered that he was the Possessor of heaven and earth?

710
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,580
Look no further than the meeting that he had with Melchizedek.

711
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,340
The instruction that he had just received.

712
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,860
As Melchizedek comes, and it's the first mention that we see in verses 18 and 19

713
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,580
when Melchizedek says the Most High God,

714
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,620
that he is the priest of the Most High God,

715
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,380
that he's coming and he says,

716
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, Possessor of heaven and earth.

717
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,540
This is the first mention of these titles for God in all of the Bible.

718
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,660
And now Abram's response to the king of Sodom

719
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,260
is that I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

720
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,420
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

721
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,660
Abram was able to answer in the manner in which he did

722
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,580
because of that meeting with Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

723
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,140
Because of the instruction that he received.

724
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,460
The preparation that God was giving Abram

725
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,100
to be prepared for the subtlety of the enemy

726
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,740
when the enemy would come and say,

727
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,260
Hey, just give me the people, you can keep all the spoil.

728
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,940
And Abram says, Actually, I have my eyes on someone greater.

729
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,660
Actually, I have my eyes on something better.

730
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm serving the Lord, the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

731
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:59,820
We know him later as the King of kings and Lord of lords.

732
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,420
We find that Abram, I'm so thankful as I look at the passage of Scripture

733
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,860
that God orchestrated this meeting with Melchizedek and Abram, aren't you?

734
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,980
You begin to see how God is working and orchestrating and preparing.

735
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,500
And Abram says, he continues in verse 23,

736
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:26,220
that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet.

737
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,300
And that I will not take anything that is thine,

738
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:39,860
lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.

739
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,900
The Scriptures already tell us on a number of occasions

740
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,580
that God had blessed Abram.

741
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,260
We read of the blessing of Abram as he goes down into Egypt,

742
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,500
as he returns from Egypt.

743
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,180
We read about how God blessed Abram.

744
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,340
And we come to this passage and we see

745
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,740
that there were three hundred and eight...

746
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,480
trained servants from his own house that went out to battle.

747
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,900
God's blessing and favor had been upon Abram,

748
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,700
but we find that the enemy comes,

749
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,040
and the enemy gives this proposition, he gives this offer,

750
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,580
and because of the meeting that Abram had with Melchizedek,

751
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,960
the picture, the type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

752
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,040
the King of Salem, and the instruction that was received,

753
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,420
he's prepared for this meeting,

754
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,540
this offer that the King of Sodom would give.

755
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,460
You know that in the New Testament,

756
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,500
actually turn there.

757
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,000
Look over at Matthew, if you will,

758
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
in chapter 4.

759
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,420
Hold your place there in Genesis.

760
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:49,080
We'll get back.

761
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,580
In Matthew 4, this is the account of

762
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,840
the temptation of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

763
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,420
The Bible says this in verse 1,

764
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,260
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit

765
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,460
into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

766
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,260
When He had fasted 40 days and 40 nights,

767
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,420
He was afterward and hungered.

768
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,340
And when the tempter came to Him,

769
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,720
he said, If Thou be the Son of God,

770
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,640
command that these stones be made bread.

771
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,680
But He answered Jesus and said,

772
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,180
It is written,

773
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,520
Man shall not live by bread alone,

774
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,020
but by every word that proceedeth

775
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,720
out of the mouth of God.

776
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,600
Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city

777
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,220
and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple.

778
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,100
Notice what he says,

779
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,480
If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down,

780
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,360
for it is written,

781
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,260
He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee,

782
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,140
and in their hands they shall bear Thee up,

783
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,440
lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone.

784
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,760
Jesus responds, It is written again,

785
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,560
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God.

786
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,020
The devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain

787
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,020
and showeth Him all the kingdoms of the world

788
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,520
in the glory of them.

789
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,660
That's where I want to focus on here.

790
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,320
The offer.

791
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,020
It says to him in v. 9,

792
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,860
And saith unto him,

793
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,020
All these things will I give thee

794
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,620
if thou fall down and worship me.

795
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,400
Then saith Jesus unto him,

796
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,740
Get thee hence, Satan,

797
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,120
for it is written,

798
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,660
Thou shalt worship the Lord Thy God

799
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,980
and Him only shalt thou serve.

800
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,240
Then the devil leaveth Him,

801
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,000
and behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.

802
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,160
Luke tells us that they departed for a little time.

803
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
The devil departed for a little time.

804
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,780
Let me submit to you this evening

805
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,080
that as Satan would tempt the Lord Jesus Christ,

806
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,240
God and flesh,

807
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,420
no doubt this evening,

808
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,460
he would bring a temptation in your life as well.

809
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,280
He wants to make you an offer.

810
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,240
I've heard many missionaries have shared this.

811
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,080
In fact, you even hear it occasionally

812
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,840
within our own borders of our own nation

813
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:03,380
that every man has their price.

814
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,080
Abram said, I'm not interested.

815
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,760
I don't want your goods.

816
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,800
I don't want what you're offering me.

817
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,160
And I find it interesting

818
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,580
that as the Lord Jesus Christ

819
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,080
in Matthew 4

820
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,300
responds to each of these temptations

821
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,460
of the devil,

822
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,540
He says, it is written.

823
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,220
We find that that no doubt is a pattern for us

824
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,440
as we go into spiritual battle and warfare.

825
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,140
It is imperative that we know the Word of God

826
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,320
so that we can respond with the Word of God.

827
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,820
We understand in Ephesians 6

828
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,480
that it is the sword of the Spirit

829
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,140
which is the Word of God.

830
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,520
And we find that Jesus says it is written.

831
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,520
In essence,

832
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,560
what we find in the response of Abram

833
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,520
in Genesis 14

834
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,600
is that he has received this revelation

835
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,860
about who God is

836
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,780
and about what God does,

837
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,400
and as he receives this revelation

838
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,480
through this meeting with Melchizedek,

839
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,400
when the King of Sodom comes

840
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,860
and makes this offer,

841
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,700
in essence, he's saying,

842
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,360
it is written.

843
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,440
I understand that it's not yet been written.

844
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,700
Moses would write it.

845
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,480
But in essence, he's saying,

846
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,320
I understand this revelation

847
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,700
that has been given to me.

848
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,480
I have my eyes on the Most High God,

849
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,780
on the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

850
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,200
I don't need your goods.

851
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm not going to take any of those things,

852
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,540
not from a thread, even to a shoelatchet.

853
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,660
I'm not going to take any of that,

854
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,780
lest thou should it say,

855
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,240
I have made Abram rich.

856
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,040
What discernment Abram has

857
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
in this passage of Scripture?

858
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,200
How did he get the discernment?

859
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,920
No doubt, it comes from spending time

860
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,740
and walking with the Lord.

861
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,080
No doubt, in our text of Scripture,

862
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,120
it's a result of that meeting

863
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,080
with the King of Salem, Melchizedek.

864
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,760
That Old Testament type of Christ.

865
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,380
He continues in v. 24

866
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,800
to finish out the passage.

867
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,520
He says,

868
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,340
save only that which the young men have eaten,

869
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,140
and the portion of the men which went with me,

870
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,500
Aner, Eshgal, and Mamre,

871
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,300
let them take their portion.

872
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,040
But Abram is in a place

873
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,600
where he is completely dependent upon the Lord.

874
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,080
It's interesting, in Psalm 57,

875
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,600
you don't need to turn there.

876
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,240
I'll just read to you very quickly

877
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,440
what the psalmist declares in Psalm 57

878
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,920
in verse 2.

879
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,620
He says,

880
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,560
I will cry unto God Most High,

881
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,760
unto God that performeth all things for me.

882
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,240
Psalm 57 and verse 2.

883
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,160
This evening, as we look at this encounter,

884
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,940
this meeting,

885
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,160
we begin to see the significance of the meeting

886
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,560
with Melchizedek, the King of Salem.

887
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,960
We begin to see the subtlety of the enemy

888
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,140
and seeing the approach of this King of Sodom.

889
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,940
I submit to you this evening

890
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,240
that we need to get our eyes on the Lord.

891
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,380
Looking unto Jesus has been our theme all year.

892
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,420
But as Abram is given this information,

893
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,520
it has a profound impact upon his life,

894
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,380
and it enables him to be prepared

895
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,820
for the subtlety of the enemy.

896
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,760
Unfortunately, we read far too often

897
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,920
of casualties in the Christian life.

898
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,460
In fact, Paul says he's writing to the people in Galatia,

899
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,520
the region of Galatia.

900
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,480
He says, you did run well.

901
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,760
Who did hinder you?

902
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,680
We find that throughout the lives of God's people

903
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,920
and as we journey this Christian life,

904
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,040
the enemy is going to come.

905
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,340
He's going to tempt you.

906
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,920
He's going to try to distract you.

907
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,660
He's going to try to get your eyes on something else.

908
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,260
He's going to try to make a deal with you.

909
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,060
To make an offer with you.

910
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,300
I mean, by the way, Abram,

911
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,380
you're the one that brought all this back.

912
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,500
I mean, it's only right that we give this to you.

913
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,100
I know the Scriptures don't say that,

914
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,500
but can you imagine in that time frame?

915
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,900
Historically?

916
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,820
The pressure?

917
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,740
But see, Abram was looking far beyond

918
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,580
what any earthly king could offer him.

919
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,840
He says, King of Sodom, no thank you.

920
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,520
No thank you.

921
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,480
I'm serving the Most High God,

922
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,680
the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

923
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,200
Oh, that we'd get our eyes on the Lord.

924
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Oh, that we'd have those times of meeting with the Lord

925
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,040
so that we could be properly prepared

926
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,280
for when the enemy comes and seeks to tempt you

927
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,440
and seeks to make a deal with you.

928
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,340
I say, not today.

929
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,820
No thank you.

930
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,140
I serve the Lord God Almighty.

931
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,260
He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

932
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,180
There's nothing that you can do for me.

933
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,620
There's nothing that you can give me

934
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,700
that He can't do.

935
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,620
I'm serving God.

936
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,460
Let's pray.

937
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,020
Father, we love You.

938
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,500
We thank You for loving us.

939
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,100
I thank You for this text of Scripture,

940
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,160
the significance of what we see transpire,

941
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,820
and how that this King of Sodom

942
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,300
set out to meet with Abram

943
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,820
as he would return from this great victory.

944
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:28,600
And yet, in Your wisdom,

945
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,940
You orchestrated it so that Melchizedek,

946
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,960
the King of Salem first,

947
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,100
had a meeting with Abram.

948
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,660
And in that meeting, Abram was prepared

949
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,340
to deal with the subtlety of the enemy.

950
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,080
God, would You help us tonight

951
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,660
to acknowledge the importance

952
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,700
of spending time with You and Your Word,

953
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,340
that we'd have the spiritual discernment

954
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,460
that only comes from You,

955
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,980
that we'd have that wisdom that You promised to give,

956
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,300
that we'd be aware of the devices of our enemy,

957
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:10,500
the tactics, the subtlety.

958
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,980
Lord, that as we learn more about who You are

959
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,100
and about what You do,

960
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:24,740
we just get so in awe of who You are,

961
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,860
that there's no offer that could come our way

962
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,260
that would cause us for even a moment

963
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,140
to become distracted.

964
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,500
As we serve the Lord God Almighty,

965
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,220
the Most High God,

966
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,940
the Possessor of heaven and earth,

967
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,700
I pray this evening that You'd speak to hearts.

968
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,980
Challenge us.

969
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,060
Help us to make some decisions tonight.

970
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,700
Lord, perhaps maybe there's some

971
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:56,540
that have had the enemy come in subtlety.

972
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,500
Seek to distract them.

973
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Oh Lord, would You help them.

974
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:09,700
Perhaps tonight, there are some that need to make a commitment to spend more time with You,

975
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:15,300
to make that a greater priority so that they could be properly prepared

976
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,300
for the day in which the enemy does come.

977
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Work in only the way You can.

978
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,300
We pray that You alone would be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

979
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,300
Would You stand with me?
