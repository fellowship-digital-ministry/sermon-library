WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.039
Genesis chapter number 14, and be looking at verses 17 through 24 this evening, Genesis

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.199
chapter number 14, and be looking at verses 17 through 24.

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:16.559
If you're taking notes this evening, I have titled the message, Abram Met Melchizedek.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.620
There's actually two kings that he meets in this particular text of scripture.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.879
He meets the king of Sodom, and he also meets Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.600
And as we look at the passage of scripture, we'll be reminded from looking at the first

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.520
section of Genesis chapter number 14 last Sunday evening, that the Lord provides us

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.439
with a record of a battle that took place in the Vale of Sidon.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:43.439
As we spoke about that particular battle, and we looked at the verse, really verse 1

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:50.360
through 16 last Sunday, and we began to understand the size of this battle, the seriousness of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.360
this battle, we dealt with the fact that they took Lot.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.000
Lot, of course, at that particular time, was dwelling in Sodom.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.760
No longer did he just have his tent pitched toward Sodom, he's now living, dwelling in

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
Sodom.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.680
And we find that the Bible tells us that they took Lot and all of his goods, and of course

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.879
at that time, Abram became involved in this particular battle.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:19.680
And the Bible gives us this truth in verse number 16, it reveals to us that Abram had

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.319
complete victory.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.160
They returned all the goods, Lot, his goods, the women and the people.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.239
Notice the Bible says, speaking of Abram in verse number 16 of Genesis 14, and he brought

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:37.559
back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.599
also, and the people.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.760
We learned two important lessons last week as we looked at those first 16 verses.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.559
One lesson we learned from the life of Lot, and that was that we need to be careful of

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:50.559
our influences.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.120
We need to be careful of the way in which we begin to allow ourselves to be exposed

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.800
to wickedness and become desensitized to wickedness, and the way in which the enemy works, and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.360
we spoke about that last Sunday evening.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.880
We also learned a lesson from the life of Abram, and we spoke about the fact that he

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.440
was engaged here in a physical battle, but we are engaged in a spiritual battle.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.639
We look at the fact that Abram had complete victory in this physical battle that he was

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:27.759
engaged in, and we only can have victory in this spiritual battle as we go in the power

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.039
of the Lord, as we put on the whole armor of God, as we understand that we wrestle not

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.000
against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.880
We sought to learn those lessons last week, and as we look further into the 14th chapter

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.160
of the book of Genesis and really finish it up this evening, and we look at the record

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.639
of these meetings that Abram has, I believe, again, that we find here within the pages

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.199
of Scripture some very important lessons for us.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.320
Notice in verse number 17, the Bible says,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.160
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, who's him, it's Abram, after his return

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.039
from the slaughter of Shador Laomer, and of the kings that were with him, the valley

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.080
of Shavah, which is the king's dale.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
And notice verse 18,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.960
Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.679
most high God.

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:28.039
And he blessed him, and said,

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:34.600
Blessed be Abram, of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.199
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.080
And he gave him tithes of all.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.279
The king of Sodom said unto Abram,

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:51.119
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.080
And Abram said to the king of Sodom,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.080
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.000
earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.839
take anything that is thine, lest thou shouldst say, I have made Abram rich.

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:18.799
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.720
me, Aner, Eshgal, and Mamre, let them take their portion.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.160
As we look at this text of Scripture, I want you to notice with me, first of all, if you're

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.880
taking notes, the significance of the meeting.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.519
It's very interesting as we look at the passage of Scripture, and I read the entirety of it

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.720
this evening so that we'd kind of get a flow of what's taking place, but it's very interesting

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.640
that as you begin reading this portion of Scripture, that you find in verse number 17

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.279
that the Bible says that the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.279
the slaughter.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.760
We find that the Bible tells us that this king of Sodom, he goes out with the express

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.399
purpose of meeting Abram.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.200
Abram is coming back from a great victory.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.540
We've already dealt with that in our previous study as we looked at the first 16 verses

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.920
of this chapter, and we find now that the king of Sodom comes and he desires to meet

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.920
with Abram.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.480
Now, it's interesting, we understand if you go back to chapter number 13 and look at verse

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.160
number 13, that the Bible says that the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.760
Lord exceedingly.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.640
Now we do not know a whole lot about this king of Sodom, in fact his name is not even

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.839
provided to us in the text of Scripture, but we do find that if he is the king of such

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.559
a wicked people, that it would not be too far of a stretch to say that he himself was

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:38.559
wicked.

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:39.559
Amen?

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:44.480
And so we find that this wicked man, this king of Sodom, he's coming and he has this

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.720
desire to meet with Abram, but right as we're looking at the passage of Scripture, we find

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.239
that the king of Salem, Melchizedek, first meets with Abram.

00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:00.000
The Bible tells us in verse number 17 that the king of Sodom goes out for the purpose

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.559
of meeting with Abram, but as we look at the passage, the Bible says in verse 18, and Melchizedek,

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.899
king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.920
You do not see any more reference to the king of Sodom until verse number 21.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.079
And so God divinely orchestrated this meeting and the timing of this meeting so that Abram

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.320
would be properly prepared to have this meeting with the king of Sodom.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.200
Before he would meet with the king of Sodom, he meets with Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.440
You note in the Scriptures the intent of this king of Sodom, and you note as we get into

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.880
the passage and start reading in verse number 21 and following the purpose of his desire

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:52.359
to meet with Abram, but you find that this one, Melchizedek, almost slips in, if you

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:58.320
will, if we could use the picture this evening, he slips in just ahead of the king of Sodom

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.119
and he has a time of meeting with Abram.

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:06.799
And it's so significant to see this meeting that takes place.

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:12.600
We, of course, as we studied through the book of Hebrews, we spent some time several weeks

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.480
ago, actually a couple of months ago at this point, dealing with Hebrews chapter number

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.480
seven and looking at Melchizedek.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.920
If you turn over, hold your place here in Genesis 14, and turn over to the book of Hebrews,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.399
if you will, I just want to make a few statements from Hebrews chapter number seven with regard

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.679
to this one, Melchizedek.

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:37.679
As I mentioned as I preached through Hebrews chapter number seven, really if Hebrews did

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:41.679
not give us some insight, there's a verse of scripture in Psalm 110 in verse number

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:47.480
four, but really this meeting in Genesis chapter number 14, for some of us, maybe we would

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.640
just briefly read over it and not really hold too much significance in our minds, but we

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.359
find that this was a significant meeting and then we see how that Melchizedek is an Old

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:01.859
Testament type of Christ.

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:05.839
Notice in verse number one of Hebrews seven, the Bible says, for this Melchizedek, king

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:11.559
of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:18.399
the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:23.019
First being by interpretation, notice, king of righteousness, and after that also king

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:28.519
of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:34.599
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.280
a priest continually.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.219
You remember that we find in the scriptures that as we would be reading the book of Hebrews

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:48.960
and studying the portion that this text is found in, that the writer of Hebrews is presenting

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.719
the Lord Jesus Christ in his priesthood as being superior to that of the Levitical or

00:08:54.719 --> 00:08:56.700
the Aaronic priesthood.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.599
And as we begin to see that he's of a greater, a higher order, he's after the order of Melchizedek,

00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:09.119
and we saw and studied in this passage and begin to see the descriptive terms that are

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:12.799
given in these first three verses of Hebrews chapter number seven.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:17.719
Now go back to Hebrews chapter, or excuse me, to Genesis chapter number 14, and notice

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:22.640
here in the text of Scripture what God tells us about this meeting.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.559
We see some of the description, we find here that he was, he's the king of Salem according

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:36.000
to verse number 18, the king of Salem, which many believe to become Jerusalem later, and

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the king of peace.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.599
We find at the end of verse number 18 it says that he was the priest of the Most High God.

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:44.359
Remember that he was a priest and king.

00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:48.919
We speak about the Lord Jesus Christ being prophet, priest, and king.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:52.520
And we find that this Melchizedek, he was a king and he was a priest.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.320
And we notice the meeting, and I want you to consider the fellowship that they had here

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.380
at this meeting.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.940
In verse number 18, Ismael...

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.520
Melchizedek kind of cuts off the king of Sodom

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.940
and comes to meet with Abram.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.680
The Bible tells us in v. 18

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.600
that Melchizedek, notice it says,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.180
Melchizedek, king of Salem,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.520
brought forth bread and wine.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.140
Bread and wine.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.140
As we begin to think about the fellowship

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.800
that they would enjoy here

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.260
at this particular meeting,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.760
and we think about the significance

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.600
of these two items that are mentioned,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.000
the bread and the wine,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.100
and we understand the significance

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.440
of these elements biblically,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.540
we begin to think about as New Testament believers

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.200
and begin to consider the way

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.140
in which God has given the church

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.240
the two ordinances,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.860
that of baptism and the second is the Lord's Supper,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.500
and we think about the Lord's Supper

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.260
and how we have the bread and the wine.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.420
We understand that contextually,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.580
and we've spent entire message on this in the past,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.820
that it's unfermented wine.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.520
You can always find in the Scriptures,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.540
contextually, whether it's speaking

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.160
of an alcoholic beverage

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.740
or the fruit of the vine.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.160
And here as we begin to see this

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.779
and we understand the picture biblically

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:11.779
and the typology and the significance,

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.720
how the bread, remember what Jesus says

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.620
is we would consider the Lord's Supper

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.779
and we'd consider the instruction of Paul

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.139
in 1 Corinthians 11,

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:21.220
the bread, why?

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.380
For the body of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.500
that's broken.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.340
The wine or the juice, why?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.540
For the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.580
His perfect blood that was shed.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.580
And we begin to see how that even

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.580
in Genesis chapter number 14,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.420
with this meeting with Melchizedek,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.020
this Old Testament type of Christ,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.940
how that they have this wine and this bread

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.200
and how significant that is

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.560
to how the Old Testament looked forward to Calvary.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.000
See, we think about the Bible

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.980
and we understand that as we look at the Bible

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.380
that yes, there is much history

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.080
that is contained within the Old Testament.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.020
In fact, as we've studied throughout

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.779
some of these pages of Genesis,

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:04.139
as you study throughout various books

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:04.980
of the Old Testament,

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.020
you see the historical nature of these things.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.139
But we understand that the theme of the Bible

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:13.020
is redemption and the main character

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.979
of the Bible is the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:14.979 --> 00:12:16.540
And we find that the Old Testament

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.699
is pointing to the day in which Messiah would come.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.300
And these Old Testament Bible characters,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.900
by faith, they looked forward

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.699
to the day that Messiah would come.

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:31.100
And here we see even in the meeting

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.260
that Abram had with Melchizedek,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.220
how that he brought forth this King of Salem,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.339
this Old Testament type of Christ.

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:42.460
He brought the bread and the wine.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.020
What fellowship they must have enjoyed.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.559
I notice not only the significance of this meeting

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.580
because of the fellowship,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.699
but I consider the instruction

00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:53.820
that Abram received during this meeting.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.020
I want you to notice in verse number 18

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.940
that the Bible says that he was the priest

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.339
of the Most High God.

00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:05.300
You see that phrase, the Most High God.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.380
You notice again in verse number 19,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.900
the Bible says that he, speaking of Melchizedek,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.619
blessed him, speaking of Abram,

00:13:11.619 --> 00:13:13.940
and said, blessed be Abram.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.940
Notice again, you see the phrase of the Most High God.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.540
Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.660
You see in verse number 20,

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.660
and blessed be the Most High God.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.500
You find in verse number 22,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.040
as Abram is now responding to the King of Sodom,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.059
he says, I have lift up mine hand

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:41.419
unto the Lord, the Most High God.

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:43.960
The Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.540
That term, the Most High God,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.979
or that name, it's really a compound name,

00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:50.300
El Elyon, it's a Hebrew word.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.020
It's really the first mention in all of the Scriptures

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.020
of this name of God, the Most High God.

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:02.260
And you find that as Melchizedek would meet with Abram

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.779
and he begins to give some instruction,

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:08.820
he greets him in the name of the Most High God.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.220
Now think about the impact and understand,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.820
as we have the Scriptures,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.380
and perhaps you can think back to the time

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.019
in which you first came to Christ

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:19.220
and first began discipleship

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.540
and learning the Scriptures

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.100
and how you would read of maybe in theology

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.399
of the names of God and the significance

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.779
of the names of God

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:32.380
and how God through His names reveals His character.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.700
Well, think of Abraham, Abram here,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.119
his name's not yet been changed,

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:39.339
but you think of Abram as he's receiving these greetings,

00:14:39.339 --> 00:14:41.059
he's receiving this instruction,

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:44.660
and the Bible says that he speaks to him

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.260
in this terminology, the name, the Most High God.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.420
I want you to know this evening

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.860
that he is the Most High God.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.299
There's none like him.

00:14:55.619 --> 00:14:57.940
And Abram, in this meeting,

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.500
remember I mentioned by way of introduction

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.600
that God divinely orchestrated the meeting

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.940
and the timing of the meeting

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.540
that Abraham would be prepared properly

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.500
for the meeting that he would have with the King of Sodom.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.420
And we find that there's some fellowship,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.739
but I see the instruction

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.380
and I find how that Melchizedek comes to him

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.399
in the name of the Most High God.

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:22.420
Notice he continues and says this in verse number 19,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.059
the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:29.619
God is the owner.

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:34.140
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.059
Now again, I want you to consider

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:37.799
the significance of this truth

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:40.980
and understand the impact that this revelation

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.820
would have upon Abram in this particular moment in his life.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.619
And maybe for some of us this evening,

00:15:46.619 --> 00:15:48.339
we say, yeah, we know that he's the Most High God.

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:50.339
Yeah, we know that he's the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:52.500
Do we live like it?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.459
Do we live like he's the Most High God?

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:57.580
Do we live like he's the possessor of heaven and earth?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.899
And here Abram is now receiving this revelation

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:05.580
and he's understanding more about this God

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.420
that he's followed and he's serving.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.019
And we understand that God had called him

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:12.660
as you look back in Genesis 11,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.980
and he called him out of the earth of Chaldeas

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.540
and Abram is following him

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:22.660
and he's learning more about this God that he's serving.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.700
He says he's the Most High God.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.700
He says he's the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.860
Exodus 9, look at a few verses of Scripture with me if you will.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.980
In Exodus 9, we're right in the midst of the plagues

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.420
in Egypt land.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.619
In fact, in this particular text,

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:44.899
we're looking at the seventh plague, that of Hale.

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:46.739
We won't read the entirety of it,

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:51.140
but I want you to see how that God would use Moses

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.339
to help Pharaoh and the Egyptians

00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:57.220
understand that the earth is the Lord's,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.779
that He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:02.179
Look at verse 29 of Exodus 9.

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:03.140
The Bible says,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.459
God said unto him,

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:08.459
as soon as I am gone out of the city,

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.339
I will spread abroad My hands unto the Lord.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.140
And the thunder shall cease,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.580
neither shall there be any more hail,

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.660
that thou mayest know

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.739
how that the earth is the Lord's.

00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:27.899
God is revealing His power

00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:30.059
through the plagues,

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:32.299
and of course, we understand contextually

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:34.100
of what's happening in Egypt land

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.619
and how Pharaoh had that perspective.

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:39.059
I don't even know who your God is.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.179
And God begins to reveal Himself

00:17:41.179 --> 00:17:44.339
and God demonstrates His power through these plagues.

00:17:44.339 --> 00:17:47.220
And now, as Moses is going to depart

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.899
after this seventh plague,

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:50.339
he says, I'm gonna leave the city,

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.580
I'm gonna spread my hands unto the Lord,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.220
and the thunder's gonna cease,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.739
there should be no more hail,

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:58.459
that you, Pharaoh, that you may know

00:17:58.459 --> 00:18:01.500
how that the earth is the Lord's.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:04.660
We find in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.580
chapter number 10,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.500
it was important for the children of Israel

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.500
to understand this truth.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.820
We find that here in the book of Deuteronomy

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.940
as you would look at the entirety of the book

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.140
and the preparation for the people of God

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.420
as they would go in to possess

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.820
the land of promise,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.980
and Moses, of course, would not be permitted

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.220
to lead the people of God

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.779
into the land of promise,

00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:30.779
and we understand, however,

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:33.940
that God would use Moses to prepare them

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.580
for the entrance into the land of promise.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.979
We understand that they would face

00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:39.619
a great number of difficulties,

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.419
there would be opposition

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:43.340
as they would enter into the land of promise,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.020
and throughout the book of Deuteronomy,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.580
God is using Moses to encourage the people,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.979
to equip the people, to prepare the people

00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:51.179
for that which they would face.

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.220
Notice in verse number 12 of Deuteronomy,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.340
chapter number 10,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.659
and now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God

00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:58.099
require of thee?

00:18:58.099 --> 00:18:59.500
But to fear the Lord thy God,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.820
to walk in all His ways,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.820
and to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy God

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.859
with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:07.500
to keep the commandments of the Lord

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.659
and His statutes which I command thee this day

00:19:09.659 --> 00:19:10.979
for thy good.

00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:12.299
You understand it's for your good.

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:14.099
It's for my good.

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:14.940
Amen?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.140
Notice verse 14.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.500
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.940
is the Lord's thy God.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.940
The earth also with all that therein is.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:31.739
God is the owner.

00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:35.979
He is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:38.580
The psalmist declares in Psalm 24,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.419
in verse number one,

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:43.299
we find that he will make this declaration

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:44.700
with regard to this truth

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.340
that we're looking at this evening.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.140
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.179
the world, and they that dwell therein.

00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:55.500
Paul would later say in the book of 1 Corinthians

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.859
in chapter number 10,

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:59.179
as he's speaking here to this carnal church

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:00.340
in the New Testament.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.340
We find that he's giving them some instruction,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.620
and he says to them in 1 Corinthians 10,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.540
in verse number 26,

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.380
for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.500
In verse number 28,

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.880
but if any man say unto you,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.800
this is offered in sacrifice unto idols,

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.540
eat not for his sake that showed it,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.760
and for conscience sake,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.600
for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.720
Now understand with me as we go back

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.560
to Genesis chapter number 14,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.340
that God is preparing Abram for this meeting

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.180
that's going to happen between he and the king of Sodom.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.880
And before he's ever going to have this meeting

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.920
with the king of Sodom,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.300
there's this meeting with the king of Salem, Melchizedek,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.300
and there's some fellowship that takes place.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.680
There's some instruction that is given.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.560
He says, listen,

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.260
I come in the name of the most high God, El Elyon.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.180
He says to him that he is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.440
And then back in Genesis chapter number 14,

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.720
notice in verse number 20,

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.560
the Bible says,

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.220
and blessed be the most high God,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.820
notice this, which hath delivered thine enemies

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.180
into thy hand.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.440
What's Abram being instructed on?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.400
It was God that gave the victory.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.520
It was God that gave the victory.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.400
We mentioned that last week as we studied

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.060
the portion of Scripture in Genesis 14,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.520
verses one through 16.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.640
And we dealt with the fact how that Abram,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.900
after he was made aware of the situation

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.140
that Lot had been taken,

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.680
that he takes his trained servants, 318,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.280
according to verse number 14,

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.020
and pursued after them and he smote them.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.520
But we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.520
and God gives us some insight

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.140
as to this victory that was wrought on this day,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.220
that the Bible says that it was God that gave the victory.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.600
It was the most high God,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.220
the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.980
It was this God, Abram, that you're serving,

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.900
that you're following.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.900
It is He which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.520
See, Abram had to understand

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.560
some things with regard to that

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.180
which he had experienced.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.900
You know, it is possible that we could have victory

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.600
and we somehow get full of ourselves.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.780
Begin to think that it was something in our power,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.060
it was something in our approach,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.660
it was something in our wit

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.300
that allowed us to have the victory.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.580
In fact, if you were to look at the book of Judges

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.820
and you would understand that

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.140
which takes place with Gideon

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.960
and you understand that in Judges 7,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.740
very interesting insight that God gives us

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.220
with regard to the battle that Gideon would be

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.100
the human instrument that God would use

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.300
to go against this great host.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.180
And we find that in verse number 2 of Judges 7,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.180
notice what God says to Gideon.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.020
It says,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.860
The Lord said unto Gideon,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.100
the people that are with thee are too many.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.220
They are too many for me to give

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.660
the Midianites into their hands.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.300
Now you understand, at this particular time,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.300
even with the number of people that Gideon had,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.260
he was still far outnumbered.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.700
But God says, Gideon, you have too many.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.060
I cannot give you the victory

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.060
with this number of people and here's why.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.740
Lest Israel vaunt themselves against me,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.560
saying, mine own hand hath saved me.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.700
So what does God say?

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.500
He says, I'm gonna make it such

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.060
that the only thing that you can explain

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.880
is that God gave us the victory.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.460
I'm going to decrease your numbers so significantly

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.340
that there would be no other explanation

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.380
for the victory that I'm going to give you

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.940
than to say God did it.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.460
See, God understands.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.620
He's the Creator.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.820
He's made us and He understands

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.380
that we sometimes as human beings

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.740
can get to the place that we get

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.260
a little full of ourselves.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.380
And we think that we've accomplished something,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.660
that we've done something.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.500
And Jesus said, without me, you can do nothing.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.620
In John 15.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.420
And so Abram in this meeting with Melchizedek

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.220
as they are having this meeting,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.340
we find that he's receiving some instruction.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.780
He's gaining a better understanding of who God is.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.580
The Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.980
He's gaining a little bit of a greater understanding

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.980
of what God does.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.620
Not only who He is, but what He does.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.420
By the way, it's good for us to continually

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.580
allow ourselves to be developed in our understanding

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.780
of who God is and what God does.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.220
It's important for us to understand theology.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.940
It's important for us to understand

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.260
the God that we serve

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.380
and that we would be students of the Word of God,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.500
that we would be instructed through the pages of Scripture,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.260
that we would understand the way in which God works.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.340
And here, Melchizedek in no uncertain terms

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.100
lets Abram understand that it was God

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.540
that delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.860
The battle that took place,

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.780
remember it was four kings with five.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.580
It was a pretty serious battle that took place.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.060
And those kings from the east that came in

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.100
that weren't too comfortable

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.620
or too excited about the fact

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.660
that those other kings had rebelled,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.380
they came in and cleaned house.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.620
And Abram, with the help of God

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.460
and his 318 servants,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.260
went and recovered all.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.580
And God allowed Melchizedek.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.700
He orchestrated that this meeting would take place

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.820
so that Abram would understand

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.700
that he would gain this greater awareness of the fact

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.340
that it's God that gives us the victory.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.940
It was God that delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.300
I think about the many battles

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.180
that you can read of throughout the Scriptures.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.740
I think about battles in which

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.940
the kings of Judah encountered the enemies.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.420
The kings of Israel encountered the enemies.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.340
And you can see very distinctly

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.820
the hand of the Lord

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.940
in providing and delivering

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.020
and giving the victory.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.500
And here, Abram is given this truth.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.180
We not only consider their time of fellowship,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.500
their time of instruction,

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.220
I want you to consider the blessing.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.500
In verses 19 and 20,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.900
the Bible says at the beginning of v. 19,

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.660
and he blessed him.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.180
Melchizedek blessed Abram.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.980
And then we find that in v. 20,

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.980
it says that he, Melchizedek, says,

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.220
and blessed be the Most High God.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.900
We notice the response of Abram

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.660
to these blessings that are mentioned.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.740
He says, blessed be Abram

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.860
of the Most High God,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.540
possessor of heaven and earth.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.260
Blessed be the Most High God

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.500
which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.580
And look at the end of v. 20.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:21.580
And He gave him tithes of all.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.500
We see again, as we've mentioned already,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.660
that there's a few first mentions.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.860
The book of Genesis is a book of beginnings.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.460
And so, obviously, as you study

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.700
through the book of Genesis,

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.580
you see a number of first mention principles.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.620
You find the first mention of El Elyon,

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.820
the Most High God.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.700
You see the first mention of the possessor

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.740
of heaven and earth.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.820
Now we see the first mention of tithes.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.780
We notice in Hebrews 7,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.620
if you hold your place there in Genesis

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.980
and turn back over to the portion in Hebrews,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.820
you find that God speaks of this

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.700
in Hebrews 7 as well.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.300
He's speaking about, of course, Abraham

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.860
and his interaction with this Melchizedek,

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.340
the king of Salem.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.500
This reference in Genesis 14,

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.820
the historical account that is given to us there.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.940
And we understand, again,

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.260
as we read the book of Hebrews,

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.220
these Jewish believers in the first century,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.300
we understand how they would hold Abraham

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.500
in high regard.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.220
And the greatness of Abraham.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.340
He was Father Abraham.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.780
We find that in verse 4 of Hebrews 7,

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.500
it says, now consider how great this man was

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.940
unto whom even the patriarch Abraham

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.660
gave the tenth of his spoils.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.260
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.420
who receive the office of the priesthood

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.740
have a commandment to take tithes of the people

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.180
according to the law that is of their brethren,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.620
though they come out of the loins of Abraham.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.300
But he whose descent is not counted from them

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.660
received tithes of Abraham

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.180
and blessed him that had the promises.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.460
It says in verse number eight in here,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.100
men that die receive tithes,

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.300
but there he receiveth them

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.380
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.900
And as I may so say,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.660
Levi also who receiveth tithes

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.700
paid tithes in Abraham.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.860
So we begin to see in Genesis 14

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.460
this record of Abram giving tithes of all

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.420
to Melchizedek, this king of Salem again,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.940
this Old Testament type of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.059
And we begin to understand the teaching

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:27.380
throughout the Scriptures with regard to giving

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.820
and understanding that giving

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.260
is a form of worship.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.180
We need to be careful when we understand

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.460
the truth of giving

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.100
and we understand the blessedness in giving

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.300
and understand that God in the New Testament,

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.900
it says that He loves a cheerful giver.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.540
That we'd understand that we worship our God

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.540
through our giving.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.500
And here, Abram recognizing the blessing

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.420
and recognizing that which he's dealing with here

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.860
in the passage of Scripture,

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.340
we find that he gave tithes of all.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.460
So, we look at the significance of this first meeting.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.220
This meeting with the King of Salem.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.220
This one Melchizedek.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:15.180
We begin to understand how that God in His wisdom is preparing Abram for this second

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.660
meeting that we find was intended really to be the initial meeting.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:27.220
Remember in verse number 17, the King of Sodom went out to meet him after his return.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:33.340
But God orchestrated it so that first, the King of Salem, this Melchizedek, has a meeting

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.980
with Abram.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:40.780
And now, Abram is properly prepared for the meeting that will take place with the King

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.420
of Sodom.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.580
We mentioned about the significance of the meeting.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.940
I want you to think about as we look at the latter portion of this chapter, number two

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.940
in your notes, the subtlety of the enemy.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.940
You understand the enemy is subtle.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:00.300
In fact, we're told in Genesis chapter 3, when we understand the events that are recorded

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:06.100
for us with regard to the Garden of Eden and sin entering into the world, that the Bible

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.940
tells us of the serpent in verse number 1 of Genesis 3,

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:16.220
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:21.900
And He said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.900
garden.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.260
And we find that He came with great subtlety.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:31.940
We understand that the Bible tells us that our enemy, in Ephesians chapter number 6,

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.200
we're told that we're to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might, put on the

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.580
whole armor of God, that we might stand against the wiles of the devil, the subtlety of the

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.900
devil, the deceitfulness of the devil.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:48.620
We find in 1 Peter 5 that Peter is giving admonition to those that he is speaking to,

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.980
that he's ministering to with regard to the enemy.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.220
And he says he's walking about seeking whom he may devour.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.620
But Paul gives us this great truth in 2 Corinthians 2 in verse number 11, when he says that we

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.060
are not ignorant of his devices, speaking of the enemy.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:12.420
And the reality is that we, as we study the Word of God, as we begin to study the events

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:18.740
that God has preserved for us in this precious book, we are able to be informed and aware

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.980
of how it is that the enemy works.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:29.300
Why would we speak this evening about this meeting with this king of Sodom and entitle

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.780
it, describe it as being the subtlety of the enemy?

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:37.780
Well, I want you to really, in the very beginning, consider the timing of this meeting.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.060
We look at the purpose as we get into the text, but I want you to consider, as we think

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:48.500
about the subtlety, this man, this king of Sodom, he comes with an offer right after

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.580
a time of great victory.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.180
See, there are times in which we experience great victory and we experience the blessing

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.380
of God, and perhaps our guard can be down.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.980
Because we're experiencing that victory.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.940
In fact, as you study the kings of Israel and Judah, and you would find at times in

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.340
their lives that they would experience victory, and shortly thereafter, they would suffer

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.140
great defeat.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.940
We need to be careful in time of blessing and time of victory.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.540
And we notice here that the king of Sodom, if you look in verse 17, it says that he went

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:30.500
out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Shador, Laomer, and of the kings

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.500
that were with him.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.120
Now remember, in verse 16, he brought back all the goods.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.940
He brought his brother-in-law and his goods and the women and the people.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.540
There's great victory that had been taking place.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.220
And here comes the king of Sodom.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.780
And he's going to come with an offer.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.580
He's going to come, and we really see the subtlety of the enemy, and we begin to notice

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.900
what's taking place.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.940
Notice in verse number 21, we look at his proposition.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.940
It says this,

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:06.940
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.260
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.180
I've already made mention that this king of Sodom no doubt was a wicked man.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.900
When we understand the way in which God describes for us the people of Sodom, the men of Sodom,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:27.340
that they were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly, we very easily can conclude

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:33.780
that this man that was the king of Sodom was a vile, wicked man.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:40.980
And this king of Sodom comes to Abram just after he's experienced great victory.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.980
And he's brought all of these things back.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.620
He's returned all of these things.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.620
And he's come back.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:51.340
And here the king of Sodom, but before he can hear the proposition of the king of Sodom,

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.940
God allows the king of Salem to first have a meeting with Abram.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:04.580
And God in that meeting that Melchizedek has with Abram reveals more of his person, reveals

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.420
more of his plan.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.940
And we find that Abram is therefore prepared for the meeting with Sodom.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.420
And when this man, this king of Sodom, gives this proposition, he says,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.540
Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:25.340
Then Abram is able to come to a place where he understands, I don't need what you're offering.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.500
Why? Because I'm serving the great God, the Most High God,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.660
who is the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.100
This wicked king of Sodom, I don't need thy goods.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:44.500
You do understand that he says, Give me the persons, and have the goods.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.420
He's concerned about the people, this king of Sodom.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.740
He's not so concerned about the goods, he's concerned about the persons.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.460
And we understand that no doubt, even at the end of this chapter,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.460
as Abram would give a response to the king of Sodom,

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.020
and he would say, No, thank you, that he would return.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:11.180
But we find that Lot would go back to Sodom.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:17.740
If the king of Salem, Melchizedek, is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.860
I would say this evening that the king of Sodom is a type of the devil,

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.940
is a type of the enemy.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.820
He's wicked, exceedingly vile.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.660
And he comes and he makes this offer, this proposition.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.540
And I love the way in which Abram responds in verse number 22 and 23.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.460
The response continues into verse 24,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.940
but I want you to see what is said in verses 22 and 23,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.980
and really grasp with me this evening how this meeting with Melchizedek

00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:01.580
properly prepared Abram for the subtlety of the enemy.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.220
It says this,

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.140
Abram said to the king of Sodom,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.860
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:21.820
The Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.300
Now let me ask you this evening,

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.940
where is it that Abram discovered that he was the Most High God?

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:36.060
Where was it that Abram discovered that he was the Possessor of heaven and earth?

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.580
Look no further than the meeting that he had with Melchizedek.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.340
The instruction that he had just received.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.860
As Melchizedek comes, and it's the first mention that we see in verses 18 and 19

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.580
when Melchizedek says the Most High God,

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.620
that he is the priest of the Most High God,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.380
that he's coming and he says,

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.380
Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.540
This is the first mention of these titles for God in all of the Bible.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.660
And now Abram's response to the king of Sodom

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.260
is that I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:16.420
the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.660
Abram was able to answer in the manner in which he did

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.580
because of that meeting with Melchizedek, the king of Salem.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.140
Because of the instruction that he received.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.460
The preparation that God was giving Abram

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.100
to be prepared for the subtlety of the enemy

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.740
when the enemy would come and say,

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.260
Hey, just give me the people, you can keep all the spoil.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.940
And Abram says, Actually, I have my eyes on someone greater.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.660
Actually, I have my eyes on something better.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:52.940
I'm serving the Lord, the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:59.820
We know him later as the King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.420
We find that Abram, I'm so thankful as I look at the passage of Scripture

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.860
that God orchestrated this meeting with Melchizedek and Abram, aren't you?

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.980
You begin to see how God is working and orchestrating and preparing.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.500
And Abram says, he continues in verse 23,

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:26.220
that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:31.300
And that I will not take anything that is thine,

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:39.860
lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.900
The Scriptures already tell us on a number of occasions

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.580
that God had blessed Abram.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.260
We read of the blessing of Abram as he goes down into Egypt,

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.500
as he returns from Egypt.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.180
We read about how God blessed Abram.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.340
And we come to this passage and we see

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.740
that there were three hundred and eight...

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.480
trained servants from his own house that went out to battle.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.900
God's blessing and favor had been upon Abram,

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.700
but we find that the enemy comes,

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.040
and the enemy gives this proposition, he gives this offer,

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.580
and because of the meeting that Abram had with Melchizedek,

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.960
the picture, the type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.040
the King of Salem, and the instruction that was received,

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.420
he's prepared for this meeting,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:30.540
this offer that the King of Sodom would give.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.460
You know that in the New Testament,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.500
actually turn there.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.000
Look over at Matthew, if you will,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
in chapter 4.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.420
Hold your place there in Genesis.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:49.080
We'll get back.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.580
In Matthew 4, this is the account of

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.840
the temptation of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.420
The Bible says this in verse 1,

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.260
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.460
into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.260
When He had fasted 40 days and 40 nights,

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.420
He was afterward and hungered.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.340
And when the tempter came to Him,

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.720
he said, If Thou be the Son of God,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.640
command that these stones be made bread.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.680
But He answered Jesus and said,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.180
It is written,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.520
Man shall not live by bread alone,

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.020
but by every word that proceedeth

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.720
out of the mouth of God.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.600
Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.220
and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.100
Notice what he says,

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.480
If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.360
for it is written,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.260
He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.140
and in their hands they shall bear Thee up,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.440
lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.760
Jesus responds, It is written again,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.560
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.020
The devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.020
and showeth Him all the kingdoms of the world

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.520
in the glory of them.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.660
That's where I want to focus on here.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.320
The offer.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.020
It says to him in v. 9,

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.860
And saith unto him,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.020
All these things will I give thee

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.620
if thou fall down and worship me.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.400
Then saith Jesus unto him,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.740
Get thee hence, Satan,

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.120
for it is written,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.660
Thou shalt worship the Lord Thy God

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.980
and Him only shalt thou serve.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.240
Then the devil leaveth Him,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.000
and behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.160
Luke tells us that they departed for a little time.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.160
The devil departed for a little time.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.780
Let me submit to you this evening

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.080
that as Satan would tempt the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.240
God and flesh,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.420
no doubt this evening,

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.460
he would bring a temptation in your life as well.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.280
He wants to make you an offer.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.240
I've heard many missionaries have shared this.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.080
In fact, you even hear it occasionally

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.840
within our own borders of our own nation

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.380
that every man has their price.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.080
Abram said, I'm not interested.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.760
I don't want your goods.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.800
I don't want what you're offering me.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.160
And I find it interesting

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.580
that as the Lord Jesus Christ

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.080
in Matthew 4

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.300
responds to each of these temptations

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.460
of the devil,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.540
He says, it is written.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.220
We find that that no doubt is a pattern for us

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.440
as we go into spiritual battle and warfare.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.140
It is imperative that we know the Word of God

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.320
so that we can respond with the Word of God.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.820
We understand in Ephesians 6

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.480
that it is the sword of the Spirit

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.140
which is the Word of God.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.520
And we find that Jesus says it is written.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.520
In essence,

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.560
what we find in the response of Abram

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.520
in Genesis 14

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.600
is that he has received this revelation

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.860
about who God is

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.780
and about what God does,

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.400
and as he receives this revelation

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.480
through this meeting with Melchizedek,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.400
when the King of Sodom comes

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.860
and makes this offer,

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.700
in essence, he's saying,

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.360
it is written.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.440
I understand that it's not yet been written.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.700
Moses would write it.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.480
But in essence, he's saying,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.320
I understand this revelation

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.700
that has been given to me.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.480
I have my eyes on the Most High God,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.780
on the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.200
I don't need your goods.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.840
I'm not going to take any of those things,

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.540
not from a thread, even to a shoelatchet.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.660
I'm not going to take any of that,

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.780
lest thou should it say,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.240
I have made Abram rich.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.040
What discernment Abram has

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.040
in this passage of Scripture?

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.200
How did he get the discernment?

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.920
No doubt, it comes from spending time

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.740
and walking with the Lord.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.080
No doubt, in our text of Scripture,

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.120
it's a result of that meeting

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.080
with the King of Salem, Melchizedek.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.760
That Old Testament type of Christ.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.380
He continues in v. 24

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.800
to finish out the passage.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.520
He says,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.340
save only that which the young men have eaten,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.140
and the portion of the men which went with me,

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.500
Aner, Eshgal, and Mamre,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.300
let them take their portion.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.040
But Abram is in a place

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.600
where he is completely dependent upon the Lord.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.080
It's interesting, in Psalm 57,

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.600
you don't need to turn there.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.240
I'll just read to you very quickly

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.440
what the psalmist declares in Psalm 57

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.920
in verse 2.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.620
He says,

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.560
I will cry unto God Most High,

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:38.760
unto God that performeth all things for me.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.240
Psalm 57 and verse 2.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.160
This evening, as we look at this encounter,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.940
this meeting,

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.160
we begin to see the significance of the meeting

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.560
with Melchizedek, the King of Salem.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.960
We begin to see the subtlety of the enemy

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.140
and seeing the approach of this King of Sodom.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.940
I submit to you this evening

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.240
that we need to get our eyes on the Lord.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.380
Looking unto Jesus has been our theme all year.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.420
But as Abram is given this information,

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.520
it has a profound impact upon his life,

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.380
and it enables him to be prepared

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.820
for the subtlety of the enemy.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.760
Unfortunately, we read far too often

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.920
of casualties in the Christian life.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.460
In fact, Paul says he's writing to the people in Galatia,

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.520
the region of Galatia.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.480
He says, you did run well.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.760
Who did hinder you?

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.680
We find that throughout the lives of God's people

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.920
and as we journey this Christian life,

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.040
the enemy is going to come.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.340
He's going to tempt you.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.920
He's going to try to distract you.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.660
He's going to try to get your eyes on something else.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.260
He's going to try to make a deal with you.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.060
To make an offer with you.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.300
I mean, by the way, Abram,

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.380
you're the one that brought all this back.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.500
I mean, it's only right that we give this to you.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.100
I know the Scriptures don't say that,

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.500
but can you imagine in that time frame?

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.900
Historically?

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.820
The pressure?

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.740
But see, Abram was looking far beyond

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.580
what any earthly king could offer him.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.840
He says, King of Sodom, no thank you.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.520
No thank you.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.480
I'm serving the Most High God,

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.680
the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.200
Oh, that we'd get our eyes on the Lord.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:33.200
Oh, that we'd have those times of meeting with the Lord

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.040
so that we could be properly prepared

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.280
for when the enemy comes and seeks to tempt you

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.440
and seeks to make a deal with you.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.340
I say, not today.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.820
No thank you.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.140
I serve the Lord God Almighty.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.260
He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.180
There's nothing that you can do for me.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.620
There's nothing that you can give me

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.700
that He can't do.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.620
I'm serving God.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:03.460
Let's pray.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.020
Father, we love You.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.500
We thank You for loving us.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.100
I thank You for this text of Scripture,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:14.160
the significance of what we see transpire,

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.820
and how that this King of Sodom

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.300
set out to meet with Abram

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.820
as he would return from this great victory.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:28.600
And yet, in Your wisdom,

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.940
You orchestrated it so that Melchizedek,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.960
the King of Salem first,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.100
had a meeting with Abram.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:42.660
And in that meeting, Abram was prepared

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.340
to deal with the subtlety of the enemy.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.080
God, would You help us tonight

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.660
to acknowledge the importance

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.700
of spending time with You and Your Word,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.340
that we'd have the spiritual discernment

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.460
that only comes from You,

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.980
that we'd have that wisdom that You promised to give,

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.300
that we'd be aware of the devices of our enemy,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:10.500
the tactics, the subtlety.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.980
Lord, that as we learn more about who You are

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.100
and about what You do,

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:24.740
we just get so in awe of who You are,

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.860
that there's no offer that could come our way

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.260
that would cause us for even a moment

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.140
to become distracted.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:36.500
As we serve the Lord God Almighty,

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.220
the Most High God,

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.940
the Possessor of heaven and earth,

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.700
I pray this evening that You'd speak to hearts.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.980
Challenge us.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.060
Help us to make some decisions tonight.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.700
Lord, perhaps maybe there's some

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:56.540
that have had the enemy come in subtlety.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.500
Seek to distract them.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.500
Oh Lord, would You help them.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:09.700
Perhaps tonight, there are some that need to make a commitment to spend more time with You,

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:15.300
to make that a greater priority so that they could be properly prepared

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.300
for the day in which the enemy does come.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.300
Work in only the way You can.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.300
We pray that You alone would be glorified, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.300
Would You stand with me?
