1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,519
Online and happy birthday to brother John and he is not 40. Amen. I don't know exactly his age, but he is not 40

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,800
I can guarantee you that happy birthday, brother

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,159
John 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 in your Bible this morning as you know throughout the year

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,920
Here in 2020 our theme has been looking unto Jesus

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,479
We systematically studied through the book of Hebrews and as we studied through the book of Hebrews

6
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:33,880
Of course, as you know as you've been with us, we finished up last Sunday and what a joy

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,799
To that it was for me

8
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,200
I hope it was a joy for you to study through the book of Hebrews and to be encouraged to be challenged to be strengthened

9
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,599
And as we study the Word of God

10
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:48,680
We know that the Bible tells us that faith come of my hearing and hearing by the Word of the Lord of the Word of

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,040
God and I'm so thankful that through studying the Word of God that our faith is increased and we serve a wonderful Savior

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,959
Amen, and I know I've shared this before with you that several

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,639
in the places in which we go we have to wear masks and all that sort of thing and so I

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
purchased a couple of masks that have

15
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,419
Some some some sayings on them. One of them says Jesus loves you

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,800
and one of them says Jesus saves and I get occasionally some people that look at me and

17
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,519
Say I like your mask

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,919
I appreciate that message and then I have other people that look at me like I want to tear that mask off your face and

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
The thing that's amazing and I thought about this week

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,160
I had some of those that just kind of looked at me funny this week with either of those masks on and I thought this

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,239
The reality is that Jesus does love you and I you don't have to believe it

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,160
but I wish you would and

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,040
I'm so thankful to know the love of God and to know the truth of the Word of God as they were singing the song

24
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,879
That we can trust his word. It will not fail

25
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,919
Amen, and what a blessing to know the truth of the Word of God to have the privilege of studying the Word of God

26
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,160
And as we've had for our theme and obviously all of these

27
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:06,239
expressions throughout the book of Hebrews how Christ is superior he's better and he is and

28
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,199
The the believers there that are being addressed the original recipients. They are being

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Just the evidence is is just so

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,479
Convincing I mean it's an

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,440
overwhelming amount of evidence to prove that Jesus Christ is superior and how important it is for us as the people of

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,479
God as we go through life as we journey life that we turn our eyes upon the Lord that we seek his face that we

33
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:37,320
understand that though the things around us may be confusing there may be

34
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:42,559
Conflict and contention and chaos and all of those things that our God is in control

35
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:46,080
Our God is sovereign and we need to look to him this morning

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,000
I've asked you to turn to 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 and we're gonna look at verses 1 through 30

37
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:57,720
As we examine this passage of scripture that records for us an event from the reign of Jehoshaphat

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,240
He's king of Judah. And if you know some things about Jehoshaphat, we understand this morning that if we were to categorize

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Kings of Judah and say there were some good kings and there were some bad kings

40
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,440
Jehoshaphat I think would fall in that category as being basically a good king

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,399
obviously, not everything in his life is is worthy of emulation of

42
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:28,360
Exemplary conduct so on and so forth. He actually made a couple of really bad decisions in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,679
He's really just following a really bad decision in which he made affinity with Ahab

44
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,440
That will not be the content of what we'll study this morning

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,119
but we find that as we come to the 20th chapter of 2nd Chronicles that we have this opportunity of

46
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,240
Reading an event in the life of Jehoshaphat that I think will help us as we're able to relate to this

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,419
Individual to this man that yes, he was the king of Judah

48
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:58,240
But he was facing a great difficulty look at it in verse 1 with me

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,119
the Bible says it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,220
Beside the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,799
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude

52
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,239
Against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria and behold

53
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:29,399
They be in hazes on Tamar which is in getting look down at verse number 12

54
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,320
If you will and the Bible says this Oh

55
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
our God

56
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,519
Will thou not judge them?

57
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,079
For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us

58
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:45,559
Neither know we what to do

59
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,239
But our eyes are

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,559
upon

61
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,839
thee

62
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,559
This morning. I want to preach a message that I've simply titled from the end of verse number 12. Our eyes are

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,959
upon

64
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,440
thee our eyes are

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:08,760
Upon thee sometimes I think as we look at the declaration in verse number 12, we can relate we have no might no strength

66
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,320
no power

67
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,200
Given the circumstances the situation which we're facing. In fact, we might say as Jehoshaphat said we don't even know what to do

68
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,079
But here's what we're doing. Our eyes are upon

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,519
Thee notice with me as we study through this passage of Scripture number one

70
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,679
If you're taking notes consider the dilemma Jehoshaphat faced

71
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,559
He faces a dilemma, of course, we know what dilemmas are problems trials difficulties

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,880
Those things that we wish we didn't have to deal with quite honestly those things that come into our lives that we say

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,359
It'd be better if we didn't have to deal with this right now. I don't have time for this. It's not a good season

74
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:50,480
It's whatever and we have these dilemmas these trials these

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,079
Times of difficulty that we face in our lives and we find that Jehoshaphat is facing such a dilemma

76
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,119
I want you to understand. This isn't the first time this man ever faced a dilemma

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,480
This isn't the first time there was ever any type of military campaign that he would be involved with and yet we find that in

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,339
This particular text of Scripture the severity of this dilemma

79
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:17,519
Reveals to us great truth that I hope would be a help to us

80
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,119
We find as we've read already in verses 1 & 2

81
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,019
that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon they form a

82
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:31,019
Coalition and they come and they've already crossed the Bible tells us in verse number two that someone came to tell Jehoshaphat

83
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,059
There was a messenger that brought this message

84
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,019
They've already come this great multitude against thee from beyond the sea of this side Syria

85
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:42,380
and we find that they were coming no doubt for the purpose of attacking and

86
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:45,980
Conquering they weren't coming to just bring kind greetings

87
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,019
They weren't coming to try to have a little brief skirmish and then just let's go home

88
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:56,299
No, they were coming to attack and to conquer and no doubt. This was a very serious situation

89
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:02,619
We find the Bible says in verse number two notice how this coalition is described as a great

90
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:08,459
Multitude we find that Jehoshaphat himself while he's praying in verse number 12

91
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,980
He will refer to this great multitude as a great company

92
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,980
And then we find in verse number 15 of our text of Scripture that the Lord

93
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:25,059
Gives answer and the the Prophet is speaking to Jehoshaphat and God says be not afraid nor dismayed

94
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,940
by reason of this great

95
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:35,459
Multitude and so when we look at the passage of Scripture and we see that can and we consider the dilemma in which

96
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,660
Jehoshaphat was facing we understand here this morning

97
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:42,459
It's a great multitude. It's a great company

98
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,339
It wasn't just that the messenger described this coalition in this manner

99
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,420
The messenger describes as a great a great multitude

100
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,019
Jehoshaphat says it's a great company and God says it's a great multitude. You know, there are times in our lives that we can

101
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:06,940
Embellish the difficulty in which we're dealing with. Amen. We can look at something and say this is the biggest trial

102
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,579
I've ever faced in my life and sometimes we get to the other side of it

103
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:14,220
We say, you know, it really wasn't that bad or we face something more difficult and say, you know

104
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,700
That thing that we faced really was just a walk in the park and we find here

105
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,459
however, that it was not a situation in which

106
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
Jehoshaphat is simply

107
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,820
Embellishing his dilemma God calls it a great multitude this great coalition

108
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,299
That is coming against Jehoshaphat king of Judah

109
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:40,020
And of course the people of Judah now understand with me as we look at the passage of Scripture how this dilemma

110
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Impacted how it affected

111
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,780
Jehoshaphat as we begin reading verse number three, the Bible says and Jehoshaphat

112
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,140
feared

113
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,380
You ever fear the things that you might face? I understand the Bible's full of fear not fear thou not

114
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,900
We studied as we've been studying through the book of Genesis

115
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,099
We will finish up the 15th chapter of Genesis this evening

116
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:08,419
But when you began Genesis 15 in verse number one, we find that God in that memorable greeting to Abram

117
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,419
He says Abram fear not

118
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:14,700
But there are times in our lives as human beings that we fear

119
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,460
It's an emotion that we have and there are times in which we fear in

120
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:24,219
Jehoshaphat here in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 in verse number 3 when he's faced with this dilemma

121
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,419
We find that the Bible tells us that he feared

122
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,380
the the

123
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,500
Important thing that we need to know as we study this passage of Scripture this morning is how is it that we respond?

124
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:39,020
in time of fear

125
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,940
How is it that we respond with dilemmas that we face in time of difficulty in time of trial?

126
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,739
When we have that fear, how does it does it cripple us?

127
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:55,820
Does it cause us to just begin to make all sorts of decisions that that are not appropriate?

128
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,340
Decisions we find that the fear that Jehoshaphat

129
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,800
experiences in this passage of Scripture

130
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,780
caused him to seek God.

131
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,320
And I mean, that's powerful.

132
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,860
It's such an imperative truth

133
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,520
for us to grasp this morning

134
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,800
because v. 3 says that Jehoshaphat

135
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,980
feared and set himself to seek the Lord

136
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,780
and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

137
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,260
Fasting in the Word of God

138
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,220
as we've mentioned throughout the years

139
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,100
is a sign of really the seriousness

140
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
of the individual seeking the Lord.

141
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,180
He's not only seeking God through prayer,

142
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,660
but he's proclaimed this fast.

143
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,500
Why?

144
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,140
Because they're serious about what's going on

145
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,580
and through this prayer,

146
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,180
this seeking and this fasting,

147
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,940
they're demonstrating their seriousness

148
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,900
with regard to the situation.

149
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,860
And so we find that the fear

150
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,600
that Jehoshaphat would experience

151
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,100
because of this dilemma

152
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,560
properly drove him to the Lord.

153
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,980
Sometimes we get to the place in our lives,

154
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,140
and I understand that even as we studied

155
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,420
in Hebrews 13 just a few weeks ago,

156
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,860
when we understand that our God is with us,

157
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,960
He said, I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee.

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,620
And then we can say that we're not gonna fear

159
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,940
what man can do unto us.

160
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,780
Why?

161
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,460
Because God is my helper.

162
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,300
But even though we understand that biblical truth,

163
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,960
I would submit to you this morning

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,020
that there are times even as the people of God

165
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,660
that circumstances will invade your life

166
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,540
and invade my life that will cause us

167
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,820
to respond with fear.

168
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,700
But what do we do in that time of fear?

169
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,880
Oh, we seek God.

170
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,380
And we begin to have Him remove those fears, right?

171
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,420
Because we're focused upon Him

172
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,660
and we're seeking Him

173
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,700
and we're seeing how He will work

174
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
in and through the situation.

175
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,460
So number one, we consider the dilemma.

176
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,100
Number two, notice the declaration of Jehoshaphat.

177
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,580
Over the next several verses,

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,820
we find this response of Jehoshaphat to this dilemma.

179
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,060
And as we begin to just dissect,

180
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,140
really verses three through 13,

181
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,740
and begin to look at this prayer

182
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,780
and this proclamation, this declaration,

183
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,300
as I have termed it,

184
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,820
we find that not only is it impactful for us

185
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,020
as the people of God,

186
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,420
but I would submit to you this morning

187
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,780
that it's exemplary.

188
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,500
It's a great example for us to begin to see the fact

189
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,540
that this man, Jehoshaphat,

190
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,860
though he's the king of Judah,

191
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,300
he's facing a serious situation.

192
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,020
It's a real dilemma in which he is facing.

193
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,020
The nation is in a situation

194
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,880
in which they are now going to seek God

195
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,300
because of this coalition that's been formed.

196
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,460
And I want you to notice the response.

197
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,220
We see in verse three, as I've already made note,

198
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,780
that he sought the Lord and proclaimed a fast.

199
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,460
It continues in verse number four.

200
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,540
And Judah gathered themselves together

201
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,580
to ask help of the Lord.

202
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,780
Even out of all the cities of Judah,

203
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,140
they came to seek the Lord.

204
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,380
There's really a couple of things

205
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,660
that I noticed in verse number four.

206
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,060
Number one, I noticed the influence of King Jehoshaphat.

207
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
I noticed that King Jehoshaphat,

208
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,020
in verse number two,

209
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,220
as he received word about this coalition

210
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,300
that was formed against them,

211
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,580
and he understood the purpose

212
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,480
in which they were coming to attack and to conquer,

213
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,820
that Jehoshaphat proclaimed a fast around all Judah.

214
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,540
And the Bible says that Judah gathered themselves together.

215
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,820
This man was an influential leader

216
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,640
in the nation of Israel, appropriately so.

217
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,580
He's the king.

218
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,860
He should have influence, amen.

219
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,180
And we find that he's influencing these people,

220
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,820
the children of Israel, the inhabitants of Judah,

221
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,460
to seek God.

222
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,220
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four,

223
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,500
even out of all the cities of Judah,

224
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,060
they came to seek the Lord.

225
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,940
What were they seeking?

226
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,260
Well, the Bible tells us they were asking help of the Lord.

227
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,180
And, you know, I'm so thankful that the Lord is our helper.

228
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,980
There are times in which, in our life,

229
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,420
we feel like we can handle the circumstances,

230
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,320
the situations, the dilemmas that come into our lives.

231
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,420
We feel that we have the ability to handle this thing,

232
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,860
but we must find ourselves as the people of God

233
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,020
to understand how important it is

234
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,460
that we are dependent upon the Lord

235
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,980
and that we ask Him for help.

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,380
You ever in a situation where you are just

237
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,460
so reluctant to ask for help,

238
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,020
yet there's help that's just close by?

239
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,380
And maybe you just work and work and work

240
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,900
and you try to figure something out

241
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
and you're just working, working, working

242
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,140
and toiling and rowing,

243
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,300
as the Bible talks about the disciples.

244
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,220
They're toiling and rowing.

245
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,060
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,260
I mean, in my mind's eye, I see it, right?

247
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,140
They're rowing as hard as they,

248
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
and they're not going anywhere.

249
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,380
Jesus came by and they invite him on the ship.

250
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,220
And guess what?

251
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,060
They're on the other side.

252
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,540
It's amazing.

253
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,460
So we just ask God for help.

254
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,700
He is our helper.

255
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,180
The psalmist declares, help, Lord.

256
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,140
And there are times in which

257
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,020
that's exactly what we need to do.

258
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,220
And they sought the Lord for the express purpose

259
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,780
of asking help of the Lord.

260
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,020
Look at verse number five,

261
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,460
as we continue looking through here.

262
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,980
And we understand that in these next few verses

263
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,740
of scripture, really in verses five through 11,

264
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,060
that as Jehoshaphat is praying,

265
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,260
that as we read these words,

266
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,500
we find that it's revealing to us

267
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,740
the knowledge that he has of God and of his word.

268
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,220
I would submit to you this morning

269
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,300
that it's imperative as us, as the people of God,

270
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,860
to be people of the book,

271
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,500
that we know the God of the Bible,

272
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
that we know the word of God.

273
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,940
Listen, when we understand that he's able to do

274
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,140
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,

275
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,180
when we understand that he said,

276
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,260
call unto me and I will answer thee

277
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,820
and show thee great and mighty things

278
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
which thou knowest not,

279
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,060
when we understand the promises of the word of God,

280
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,060
it will cause us to run to him for help.

281
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,460
We've been singing our theme song since June

282
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,020
from Psalm 121.

283
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,340
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills

284
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,540
from whence cometh my help.

285
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,740
My help cometh from the Lord,

286
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,060
which made heaven and earth.

287
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,620
When I understand that he said,

288
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,460
let there be light and there was light,

289
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,540
when I understand that he created everything

290
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,460
out of nothing that he said and it was done,

291
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
man, it causes me to understand

292
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,180
that he's able to help me

293
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,980
and he's able to help you.

294
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,340
Notice in verse number five,

295
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,900
the Bible says that Jehoshaphat stood

296
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,100
in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem

297
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,940
in the house of the Lord before the new court

298
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,980
and said, this is where the prayer begins,

299
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,340
oh Lord God of our fathers,

300
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,100
art not thou God in heaven

301
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,100
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen

302
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,180
and in thine hand is there not power and might

303
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,300
so that none is able to withstand thee.

304
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,860
Notice in verse number six that he, Jehoshaphat,

305
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
understands that our God is sovereign

306
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,660
and that he is omnipotent.

307
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,740
You understand this morning as we consider

308
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,020
the event and the life of Jehoshaphat,

309
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,340
but even as we begin to make application

310
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,020
for our own lives today and think about

311
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,220
the dilemmas that we face,

312
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,780
maybe as individuals, maybe as families,

313
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,300
maybe as a church, maybe as a nation,

314
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,340
we begin to see the dilemmas that we face

315
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,500
and we must recognize this morning

316
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,300
that the word of God reveals to us

317
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,140
that our God is sovereign,

318
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,460
that our God is the omnipotent God

319
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,700
and that he reigns, that there is nothing

320
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
that's too hard for him.

321
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,620
And we find that Jehoshaphat, as he's praying,

322
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,660
he's recognizing that again, it reveals to us

323
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,980
his knowledge of who God is.

324
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,740
In verse number seven, art not thou our God?

325
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,940
You notice the personal relationship.

326
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,500
He's our God.

327
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,700
Aren't you thankful for that?

328
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,180
It says here, who didst drive out the inhabitants

329
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,380
of this land before thy people Israel

330
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,380
and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever?

331
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,100
We find that God has worked mightily

332
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,780
on the behalf of his people

333
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,100
and here Jehoshaphat would rehearse

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,220
that which had been really the understanding

335
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,140
of the start of the nation of Israel

336
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,540
and the promise to Abram as we'll be studying

337
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,660
even this evening in Genesis chapter number 15

338
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,580
and we've studied over the last several passages

339
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,860
of scripture in the book of Genesis

340
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,100
with regard to the promise that God gave to Abram

341
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,940
and as we notice here that Jehoshaphat

342
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,380
is aware of those things.

343
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,380
He's aware of the mighty acts of God.

344
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,820
I wonder this morning, how often do we rehearse

345
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,140
what God has done?

346
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,340
When we face a dilemma, when we face a difficulty

347
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,180
and we go to God in prayer,

348
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,180
I wonder how our faith is encouraged, increased.

349
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,660
I wonder how our fear is decreased

350
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,340
when we just rehearse what God has done.

351
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,620
When we're mindful of the mighty acts of our God.

352
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,100
Our God is amazing and he's done some amazing things

353
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,140
and he's recorded for us in this precious book

354
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,700
so many amazing miracles that are impactful for us

355
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,820
as the children of God.

356
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,460
In your life and in my life, God has worked miracles.

357
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,340
God has answered prayer in your life

358
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,780
and that encourages you.

359
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,260
He's seen you through the storm before

360
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,540
and it caused you to have great comfort

361
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,900
and great confidence and faith knowing

362
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,820
that he's with you even in the midst of the trouble,

363
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
the dilemma that you're facing today.

364
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,740
We find that the prayer continues,

365
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
notice in verse number eight,

366
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,020
and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary

367
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,140
therein for thy name saying,

368
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,140
if when evil cometh upon us as the sword,

369
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,980
judgment or pestilence or famine,

370
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,820
we stand before this house and in thy presence

371
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,020
for thy name is in this house

372
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,860
and cry unto thee in our affliction,

373
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,340
notice this last phrase,

374
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,059
then thou wilt hear and help.

375
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,140
Jehoshaphat knew that that's what God had said.

376
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,820
You look at the declaration, the proclamation,

377
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,340
the dedication of the temple under the reign of Solomon

378
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,740
and you read all of that, which is taking place,

379
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,500
obviously the building of the temple,

380
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,900
you get into 2 Chronicles.

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,740
6 and 7, and you read the prayer of Solomon into all the activities and

382
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,420
festivities, if you will, that surrounded the dedication of the temple, and then

383
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,180
how God answers, I've heard thy prayer, is what God says to Solomon in chapter

384
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,580
number 7, and we find that within the context of those chapters that Jehoshaphat

385
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,660
is mindful of that promise, and he's saying, here's what we're doing. You said

386
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,980
if when these evil things come, that if we come to this place and if we cry unto

387
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:34,600
thee in our affliction, that you will hear and help. Therefore, based upon what

388
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,620
you have said in your word, God, we're here asking you for help. Amen? And listen,

389
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,700
if you don't know the Word of God, you're not gonna know that you can go to him

390
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,020
for help, right? And so we find that Jehoshaphat, with facing this dilemma,

391
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,620
with dealing with this difficulty, his knowledge of who God is, but also his

392
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,900
knowledge of what God has said, that God wants to be your helper. Listen, we

393
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,500
understand the psalmist has declared this throughout the Psalms, and we've

394
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,380
studied many of them as we've had the opportunity to speak about the truth

395
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,340
that our God is our helper, and we think about this truth, you don't need to turn

396
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,500
there, but in Psalm 46 and verse number 1, the psalmist declares God is our

397
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:24,420
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. He's not only able to help,

398
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,220
he's available to help. Have you ever known somebody that's able to help, but

399
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,240
they just don't have any availability? You need help with a project, and you

400
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,420
know so-and-so can help you, because they have the know-how, but they're just

401
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,060
simply not available. They're busy, they have other appointments, they have other

402
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,980
tasks that they're working on. That never happens with God. He's a very present

403
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,100
help in the time of trouble. It's interesting what the psalmist continues

404
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,700
to say in Psalm 46 and verses 2 and 3. He says, therefore, based upon our

405
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,060
understanding that God is our refuge and our strength and a very present

406
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,660
help in trouble, will not we fear, though the earth be removed and though the

407
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,100
mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar

408
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,500
and be troubled, though the mountains shake with swelling, thereof,

409
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,020
selah. That word selah in the book of Psalms is a precious word. It means to

410
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,020
stop and meditate and muse upon and allow it to sink in. Someone over the

411
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,300
years, many people have asked me how much of the Bible should they read every day

412
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,500
and that sort of thing, and kind of developing a Bible reading program and a

413
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,860
schedule and so on and so forth, and I've often told people that the

414
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,940
quality of your time with the Lord is of more importance than the quantity of the

415
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,940
number of verses or chapters that you read. There are times, and I hope that

416
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,180
you've experienced this as a child of God, there are times that God will arrest

417
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,380
your attention upon one verse of Scripture and you just simply don't get

418
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,540
any further than that one verse. But oh, you had a hallelujah time with the Lord

419
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,460
on that day, you understand what I mean. And the reality this morning is that we

420
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,540
can, when we look at the the psalmist and we say, selah, listen, we stop and we

421
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,380
meditate and we think about this, we say, listen, this is impactful truth. And see,

422
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,340
Jehoshaphat, back in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20, he knew that God had

423
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,700
said this. What was it that caused him, in light of the dilemma, in light of the

424
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,020
difficulty that he was facing, why is it that he proclaimed this fast? Why is it

425
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,140
that he sought the Lord? Why did he bring the people? Because he knew that God said

426
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,980
that if you seek me, I will hear and I will help. What did the songwriter say in

427
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,580
the song that the the girls, Holly and Julianne and Brianna, played for us?

428
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:49,660
His word will not fail you. It won't. God is not a man that he should lie. Every

429
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,820
promise of God in him is yea. These promises are exceeding great and

430
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,420
precious promises. And we find that this man, Jehoshaphat, what a great

431
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,540
example for us. He's saying, in simple faith, his actions are saying, I believe

432
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,340
you, God. And here's why we're here. Continue, look in verse number 10,

433
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,340
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldst

434
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,020
not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned

435
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,460
from them and destroyed them not. Behold, I say, how they reward us to come to cast

436
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,220
us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. In verses 10 and 11,

437
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,340
not only does it reveal to us again more of the knowledge that Jehoshaphat has

438
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,420
of the historical events, but it also reveals to us the transparency of

439
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,700
Jehoshaphat. You know, did God already know this? Sure he did. Our God is

440
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,140
all-knowing. He's omniscient. He already knew what they were facing. He already knew

441
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,740
those that were gathered against. He knew about this great company, this great

442
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,220
multitude. But you understand that there's something beneficial for us, as

443
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,540
the people of God, to be transparent with God and to just pour our heart out to

444
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,580
him and say, God, here's the specific issue that I'm facing. Here's

445
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,940
the specific difficulty, dilemma, that I'm dealing with in my life. For Jehoshaphat,

446
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,220
in this text of Scripture, specifically, the dilemma is that there's a coalition

447
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,460
that's formed against them, Moab and Ammon and others along with them, and

448
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,100
they're coming to attack and conquer. So what does Jehoshaphat do? I'm being

449
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,900
transparent with God. Here's my problem, God. Hezekiah, when the Assyrians

450
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,460
come in, Rabshakeh's coming and telling them, as the representative of

451
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,100
Sennacherib, he's coming and saying, here's what we're gonna do, here's what

452
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,180
we're gonna do, and letters were written. What does he do? He goes and he lays it

453
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,020
out before the Lord. God, here's what they're saying. Not only is it what

454
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,540
they're saying, what they're saying is true. They've conquered all of these

455
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:58,500
surrounding nations. They do have great power, but God, you're the Lord of the

456
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,740
universe. These other nations, they serve false gods, but we serve you. Hezekiah

457
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,460
lays it out before the Lord. And I would say to you this morning, as we look at

458
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,780
this passage of Scripture, and we've made note that it was a—not only do we

459
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:22,620
see that through this impactful event, it's exemplary. We find that we're in

460
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,300
that place of, hey, let us get before the Lord and just pour our heart out to God

461
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:32,460
and just be honest with God. He knows anyway, but there's something beneficial

462
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,940
about us saying it to God and just letting him know. We continue as we find

463
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,220
that he's stated the problem, and we see this declaration as we read for—by way

464
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,860
of introduction for our title this morning, but look in verses 12 and

465
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:57,020
13 again with me. Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might

466
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,020
against this great company that cometh against us. I find in that first

467
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,740
statement that is there, and he continues by saying, neither know we what to do,

468
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,500
that it's a recognition of their inability. You know that requires

469
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,620
humility. In your pride and in my pride, we want to figure that we can take care

470
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,820
of it. We got this. We can handle this. But the reality is that when we find in

471
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,540
this declaration in the first, really two-thirds of verse number 12, that

472
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,940
Jehoshaphat is in his declaration, he's recognizing his inability. We have no

473
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,420
strength, we have no might, we have no power against this great company. We're

474
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,820
saying, we're just—we're not fit for this battle. We're not able. And furthermore,

475
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,940
we just flat-out don't know what to do. Have you ever been there? You just don't

476
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,180
know what to do. Sometimes—and I'll be very transparent with you—sometimes I

477
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,020
pray to the Lord in these type of terms, and I say, Lord, I'm not smart enough to

478
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,620
know how to figure this thing out. You just need to make it extremely plain and

479
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,420
clear to me, because I'm just not smart enough. He said, I can't believe—you're not smart

480
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,260
enough either, amen? Seriously, we don't know the end from the beginning, but we

481
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,180
know the one who does. So would it not be foolish of us to think that we can

482
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,940
handle all of our problems? No. We go to God and say, I don't know what to do. And

483
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,980
that's what Jehoshaphat does. He says, we don't have the power, the might, we don't

484
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:38,660
have the ability, and we don't know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. What a

485
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:48,059
precious statement. Our eyes are upon thee. This, as we would say that it was a

486
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,940
recognition of their inability in the first part of the verse, we'd say in the

487
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,220
latter part of the verse that it's a declaration of their dependence. John 15,

488
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,700
we find that Jesus teaches the disciples, and of course for us to have the

489
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,900
understanding of that teaching, that without Him we can do nothing. The

490
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,900
songwriter said, I need thee every hour, and I know I've often said not to try to

491
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,220
one-up or correct the songwriter, but the reality is that we need Him every second

492
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,140
of every minute of every hour. We need God. And here the the King of Judah, He

493
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:31,500
says, our eyes are upon thee. In the dilemma that you're facing, we know the

494
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,180
dilemma that Jehoshaphat is facing, it's historical record, it's for us to be able

495
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,340
to examine, but God's Word is given to us, not just for a history lesson, God's

496
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,580
Word is given to us so that we can apply in our own lives. What's the dilemma that

497
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,260
you're facing? What's our difficulty that we're dealing with today, and have we

498
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,140
come to the place of declaring our inability and declaring our dependence

499
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:02,220
upon God? God, our eyes are upon thee. All year, look

500
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:09,700
unto Jesus. Turn your eyes upon Jesus, they sang this morning. We've just

501
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,940
gone through and began to understand the significance and the importance of us

502
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,580
trusting God. Listen, He is the author and finisher of our faith. He is just, I mean,

503
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,900
He's amazing. And as we begin to see how that Jehoshaphat would make this

504
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,780
declaration, we find in verse number 13 that all Judah stood before the Lord

505
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,140
with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Oh, how important verse

506
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,540
number 13 is. Can I submit to you this morning that husbands, your wives need to

507
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,500
know that you're trusting God. Parents, your children need to know that you're

508
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,900
trusting God. Listen, our families need to understand that we are seeking God.

509
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,860
Their little ones, their wives, their children, the families were there. They

510
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,260
were gathered together in seeking the Lord, and we find the power of that, and

511
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,020
the importance of that. Listen, why is it we have people that are writing books

512
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,740
and dealing with all of this sort of thing, how that we're losing a

513
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,380
generation in our churches, and can I tell you that for the most part they're

514
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:21,060
right, we are. Why? Somewhere we've lost it. There's been a disconnect. And the

515
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,180
reality is that here in verse number 13, when we think about this influence, when

516
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,860
we think about the the setting and all that was taking place, and how important

517
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,060
it is for the children to know that we are seeking God for help, that we're

518
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:40,700
dependent upon Him. Not only do we consider the dilemma, and notice the

519
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,500
declaration as we finish up the passage of Scripture this morning, I want you to

520
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,220
rejoice in the deliverance of the Lord. I know that our time is kind of, I took too

521
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,140
long on 13 verses, but let's look at verse 14 down through verse 30. Then upon

522
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,460
Jehaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jael, the son of

523
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst

524
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:12,860
of the congregation, and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and the inhabitants of

525
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:19,940
Jerusalem, and thou, King Jehoshaphat, thus saith the Lord unto you. Now that's

526
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,980
exciting, because the Lord is answering their prayer. Remember what he said in

527
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,860
verse number nine, that then that will hear and help, and God is answering the

528
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,460
prayer. He's heard the prayer of his people, and Jehoshaphat has influenced,

529
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,020
and he's led the nation of Judah in seeking the face of God, and now the

530
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,700
Lord is speaking, the Lord is giving an answer. Notice what he says in verse 15,

531
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:50,860
Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, for the battle is

532
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:59,020
not yours, but God's. Oh, how we could focus so much of our time upon that last

533
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:05,940
statement of verse number 15. The battle is not yours, but God's. We find this

534
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,020
morning that we are engaged in spiritual warfare. We see it so evidenced in our,

535
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,100
just the day and age in which we're living, we see it all around us,

536
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,260
the evidence of this spiritual warfare, this spiritual battle that we're engaged

537
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,500
in, and we understand that we must recognize that it is a spiritual battle.

538
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,020
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, against spiritual wickedness in high

539
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,380
places. That's what Paul says to the believers at Ephesus in Ephesians

540
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,700
chapter number 6, and we are to be strong in the Lord and the power of his

541
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,900
might. If God be for us, who can be against us? We are more than conquerors

542
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,340
through Christ, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our

543
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,780
Lord Jesus Christ. Listen, what a joy to know that God is the Lord God omnipotent

544
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,460
and that he rules and reigns, and we are, as the songwriter said and Dr. Curtis

545
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,260
Hudson often sang, we are on the winning side. What a joy that is. It says in verse

546
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:09,180
number 16, tomorrow, go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by the cliff

547
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,340
of Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of

548
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,940
Jerul. Now, I'm thankful God didn't stop there and just tell him where he's gonna

549
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,580
find them, but he continues and gives him more information. Verse 17, ye shall not

550
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,220
need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the

551
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,980
salvation of the Lord with you. O Judah and Jerusalem, fear not, nor be dismayed.

552
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,540
Tomorrow, go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. We notice several

553
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,580
things in verse number 17. We find that he says, stand ye still and see the

554
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,420
salvation of the Lord. We are mindful of that truth when Moses says to the

555
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,940
children of Israel as they were to cross over the Red Sea, stand still and see the

556
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,060
salvation of the Lord, and then they're told to go forward and they cross over

557
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,220
on dry ground. We find here that he says here that they're not to fear on two

558
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,740
occasions. In verse 15, again in verse number 17, he says, fear not, nor be

559
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,740
dismayed. He tells them again, and what a great reminder for us to be aware of the

560
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:19,500
presence of God, for the Lord will be with you. The Lord will be with you. Verse

561
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,260
18, and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and

562
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,740
the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. And the

563
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,300
Levites, and the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the

564
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,820
Korhites, stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high, and

565
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,180
they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. And

566
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,300
as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, hear me, O Judah, and the

567
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,700
inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be

568
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,020
established. Believe his prophets, so shall you prosper. And when he had

569
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,660
consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should

570
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,300
praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say,

571
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,980
praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever. It's interesting as you look at

572
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,020
verses 18 through 21, and really the first statement, verse 22, that we'll

573
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,100
look at in just a moment, you see the rejoicing. It's impactful. Before the

574
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,500
actual deliverance, they're rejoicing in what God is going to do. Why? Because

575
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,300
they're so certain that what God has said he was going to do, that he will do,

576
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:34,500
that they can rejoice before it even happens. That's amazing. It's also

577
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,940
something that we should do in our lives. It reminds me of what Paul tells

578
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,180
the believers in Philippi, in Philippians chapter number 4, and verse number 6, and

579
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,000
often we quote the verse of Scripture, but we find here that the Bible says, be

580
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,500
careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving.

581
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:03,220
Let your requests be made known unto God. And here in verses 18 through 21, the

582
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,020
people are worshiping the Lord. They're praising the Lord. We find that

583
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,700
Jehoshaphat again stands up in verse 20, and he says, believe in the Lord your

584
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:19,120
God. Have faith. Believe what God has said. In verse 21, they're there and they're

585
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,500
praising the beauty of holiness, that they're praising the Lord and the beauty

586
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,100
of his holiness, and it says, praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever. And

587
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,300
notice verse 22, the beginning of the verse, it says, and when they began to

588
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,520
sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon

589
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,740
Moab and Mount Seir. You understand that God loves to receive our praise. He does.

590
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:49,900
And they're praising God before they find the coalition dead. They soon are

591
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:56,820
going to find the coalition dead, but their rejoicing precedes the evidence of

592
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,820
what God said he would do. Why? They had faith. They just believed that God was

593
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,220
going to work, that God was going to do what he said he was going to do. We find

594
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,540
in verse 22, he sets the ambushments. It says that at the end of the verse, which

595
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,260
were come against Judah, and they were smitten. We see the response as we

596
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,060
consider this final point of rejoicing in the deliverance of the Lord. We see

597
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,460
how the Lord responds, but we also see the rejoicing of the people of God. And

598
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,420
then we read of the victory. The Bible ends verse 22 by saying, and they were

599
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,380
smitten. Notice in verse 23 and down through verse number 24, the record of

600
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,660
the defeat of this coalition. It says, for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up

601
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,180
against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them. And

602
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,500
when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to

603
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,220
destroy another. And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness,

604
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,860
they looked unto the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to

605
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,460
the earth, and none escaped. Verse 25, and when Jehoshaphat and his people came

606
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,020
to take away the spoil of them, they found among them an abundance both

607
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,060
riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels, which they stripped off for

608
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:10,100
themselves. Notice this, more than they could carry away. And they were three

609
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,540
days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. That reveals to us in verse

610
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,380
number 25 a couple of things. Number one, it reveals to us the size of this

611
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,140
coalition. Remember, the messenger said it was a great multitude. Remember,

612
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,940
Jehoshaphat says it's a great company, and God, through the prophets, says it's

613
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,220
a great multitude. We find that it reveals to us that as Jehoshaphat had

614
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,380
rightly proclaimed to the Lord, we don't have any might against this great

615
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,340
company, we don't know what to do. The Bible tells us in verse number 25, there

616
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,580
was so much spoil that they couldn't carry it away. There weren't enough of

617
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:51,260
them to carry away the spoil. Furthermore, it took them three days. It says that, and

618
00:39:51,260 --> 00:40:00,380
they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. Sometimes God will

619
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,340
bring you to a dilemma, a difficulty.

620
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,500
that's just absolutely 100% beyond anything you could even imagine doing.

621
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,460
Why? Because that's when God gets the glory. That's when God gets the glory. We

622
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,380
understand that in the life of Gideon. We speak about it often. God says to Gideon,

623
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,020
nope, if I give you the victory with that many people, you guys are gonna say you

624
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,100
got the victory. So I need to bring it down. Just tell them if they don't want

625
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,260
to fight, go home. And a bunch of them went home. You understand they were

626
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:44,580
already outnumbered before the army was decreased in size. Vastly outnumbered.

627
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,460
God says if they don't, if they want to go home, they don't want to fight, let

628
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,740
them go home. Why'd all those rascals go home? Because they knew they were

629
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,820
outnumbered. We're going home. And then God said it's still too many. Here's what I

630
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,740
want you to do. And we know the account. We know what, Judges 6 through 8, read the

631
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,460
chapters. And you can see all that God does. But what God is doing is saying,

632
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:10,940
listen, God works in these moments of impossibility so that he would be

633
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,340
glorified. So that it's not explained as, well, that was the the wisdom and might

634
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,260
of the King Jehoshaphat. He set this great plan in order, and he did this, and

635
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,100
he did that, and let's lift up King Jehoshaphat. No, no, no. King Jehoshaphat

636
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,620
said to the people, I don't know what to do. He said that to God. But the people

637
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,740
were there. Oh, but the leader, the king, is supposed to make it make it so

638
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,580
everybody thinks he knows what he's gonna do. Sometimes the leader doesn't

639
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,740
know what he's gonna do. And a good leader depends upon God. Because you

640
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,460
understand that even though someone's a leader, it doesn't make them have

641
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:56,260
infinite knowledge as God does. We're still human beings. And we find here that

642
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,340
Jehoshaphat, he's not gonna receive any glory for this victory. The people of

643
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,900
Judah aren't gonna have any any kind of glory for this victory. They didn't

644
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,500
do anything. Nothing. They just simply went and collected the spoils. When they

645
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,940
arrived, they were all dead. God had worked on their behalf. Notice with me,

646
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,300
not only was it a complete victory and the spoils are gathered, but they

647
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,060
returned to Jerusalem. In verse number 26, on the fourth day, they assembled

648
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,620
themselves in the valley of Barakah, for they, excuse me, for there they blessed

649
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,860
the Lord. Now, that's an important statement. Again, they were praising

650
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,900
God beforehand, but then don't forget to praise God afterwards as well. Amen?

651
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,100
They praised him before, but then when they actually experienced the victory

652
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,580
and got it, they blessed the Lord. Therefore, the name of the place, the same

653
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,980
place, was called the Valley of Barakah unto this day. I think that as we read

654
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,820
that statement throughout the scriptures, and especially you read it in the book

655
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,980
of Joshua in particular, unto this day, I think there's great significance in that

656
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,780
because I'm mindful of when the event took place and then when the record was

657
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,300
written and then reread, that unto that day it was still called the Valley of

658
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,100
Barakah, and what a great teaching tool and an opportunity of influence to say,

659
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,780
let me tell you what happened. How did this place get its name? You ever think

660
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,340
about that when you travel? You travel places, you begin to travel the world,

661
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,340
what's the significance of this town? How did this town get its name? How did this

662
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,860
place get to be called this? Well, in the Valley of Barakah, let me tell you what

663
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,300
happened. There was a coalition, I'm not going to reveal or I'm not going to

664
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,140
recite everything I just said, but you understand, right? What a great

665
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,740
opportunity. Verse 27, then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem and

666
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:54,380
Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem, how? With joy. How

667
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,940
did Jehoshaphat start in verse number three? With fear. With fear. But it was an

668
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,180
honest situation. Sometimes we can say, I'm not afraid, but inside you know you're

669
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:11,740
afraid, right? And here it says they returned with joy. Why? For the Lord had

670
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,220
made them to rejoice over their enemies. They came to Jerusalem with psalteries

671
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,260
and harps and trumpets under the house of the Lord. In your mind's eye, can you

672
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,540
see them returning? I mean, honestly, in your sanctified imagination, they're not

673
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,380
walking back like this, oh man, it was a long trip and I'm just, man, they're

674
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,980
coming back excited. I mean, they're rejoicing in what God has done and how

675
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,420
God has worked. And this was a time to exalt and magnify the Lord God Almighty

676
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,980
and they're returning with psalteries and harps and trumpets under the house

677
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,100
of the Lord. It's a big deal. And I think the people that were left back in

678
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,980
Jerusalem when they went out, the ones that were there, right? The wives and the

679
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,620
children. Can you imagine how they were feeling upon the return of the men as

680
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,620
they were coming back? And they're coming back with the spoils, but they're coming

681
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:11,100
back rejoicing. In verse number 29, the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of

682
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,740
those countries when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of

683
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,460
Israel. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round

684
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,500
about. In verses 29 and 30, I notice in this passage the impact upon the

685
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,980
surrounding people groups, the surrounding nations. Can I tell you this

686
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,660
morning that when God works, not when we try to manufacture God working, but when

687
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:42,260
God works, people take note of that. The world understands. You understand that

688
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,940
during the revival ministry of many of those great evangelists in the beginning

689
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,420
of the 20th century of this nation, that there were people in communities that

690
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,660
feared those evangelists coming to their communities. Why? Because they knew that

691
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,620
the liquor stores and liquor places and the saloons and all of those places, all

692
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,980
of the places of ill report, they're gonna shut down. Because somebody's gonna

693
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,180
come in there, they're gonna preach the gospel, and people are gonna get saved,

694
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,020
scores of people are gonna get saved, and it's gonna change the town. They were

695
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,900
fearful of it. Why? They were taking note of what God was doing and how God was

696
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,020
working. And I would submit to you this morning that as we put ourselves in the

697
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,260
position as Jehoshaphat did and the nation of Judah did, they say, we don't

698
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,940
know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. We're looking to you. We're trusting

699
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:31,660
you, God, in this moment of difficulty, in this dilemma that I'm facing. I'm trusting

700
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,660
you, and I'm asking you to work in such a way that you alone will be glorified.

701
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:42,980
People are gonna notice, and it's important for us to give glory to God.

702
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,420
Don't take this, yeah, well, you know, I figured it out. He didn't figure anything

703
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:53,780
out. Amen? Jehoshaphat didn't know where to go. In fact, God told him when to go

704
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,860
and where to go. He didn't leave anything open to Jehoshaphat's own figuring it

705
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:04,100
out. And this morning, as we think about this great passage in 2 Chronicles 20,

706
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,260
this event in the life of Jehoshaphat, I hope that we leave with more than just a

707
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:16,300
history lesson. I hope that we leave with saying, our eyes are upon thee. I understand

708
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,500
in a group of people, really of any size, there are dilemmas, there are

709
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:30,380
difficulties, there's opposition, there's problems, but our God is able to help.

710
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:39,340
And we must declare, as Jehoshaphat did, our eyes are upon thee. Our eyes are upon

711
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:45,340
thee. I'm looking unto my Savior, understanding who He is, understanding

712
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,020
what He's done, understanding what He's promised, and I'm saying, God, would you

713
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,540
work? I was reading this morning in my own personal devotions to the book of

714
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,940
John, and once again, it's a familiar verse of Scripture, but once again, my

715
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,300
attention was focused upon that great declaration of John the Baptist in John

716
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,700
3 in verse 30, he must increase and I must decrease. Listen, it's all about God

717
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,860
being glorified. And as long as you're trying to figure out your own problems,

718
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,380
and as long as you're trying to have somebody recognize how smart you are to

719
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,860
figure out all of your dilemmas in life, God's not gonna be glorified. And we

720
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,020
need to just simply come in simple faith and obedience and say, God, I don't have

721
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:32,580
the might, the strength, or the power. I don't have any idea what to do, but

722
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:38,100
here's what I'm doing. My eyes are on you. I'm seeking you. I'm asking you for help.

723
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:44,420
And God is a very present help at the time of trouble. And he says, here's what

724
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,420
I want to do for you. Here's how I'm gonna work on your behalf. And he gives

725
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,500
us the victory. And then we say, thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

726
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,940
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Our eyes are upon thee. Father, we love you this

727
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,500
morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the opportunity to be

728
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,580
gathered together this morning for the purpose of worship. We thank you for the

729
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,740
opportunity to study this passage of Scripture, to be reminded of this

730
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:19,940
historical event during the reign of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. I believe this

731
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:26,260
morning in my own life that this record of 2 Chronicles 20 is impactful. It's

732
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:33,300
exemplary. The purpose of studying your Word is not to simply have a better

733
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,220
grasp or understanding of historical events or timelines, though we gain that

734
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,540
understanding. It's that we might be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

735
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,340
That we might take the truth and apply it in our lives. And I pray this morning

736
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:55,660
the Holy Spirit of God has moved and worked the lives of your people. No doubt

737
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:06,300
there are dilemmas that we face. I pray that we would respond as Jehoshaphat

738
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:15,420
did and declare our dependence upon thee, would cause us to then rejoice in your deliverance,

739
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,980
to exalt and magnify your name.

740
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,500
Understand this morning that the dilemmas that we face are quite different than that

741
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,100
which was faced by Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah on this particular day, but dilemmas

742
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,100
nonetheless.

743
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,140
God we pray that you'd be exalted in our lives.

744
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,020
There's one that does not know you as their personal Lord and Savior, it's our prayer

745
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,860
today that they would allow us to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure

746
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,180
that heaven is their home.

747
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:50,740
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure of their eternal destination.

748
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,420
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee during this time of invitation.

749
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,300
For it's in Christ's name we pray, would you stand with me?

750
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

751
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,620
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does, I'd invite you to respond

752
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,620
to the Lord.

753
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,460
You can use your pew as an altar, you can come to this old-fashioned altar, but let

754
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,580
the Lord have His way in your life.

755
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,500
Be a doer of the word and not a hearer only.

756
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,060
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
