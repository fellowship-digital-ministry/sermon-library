00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.519
Online and happy birthday to brother John and he is not 40. Amen. I don't know exactly his age, but he is not 40

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.800
I can guarantee you that happy birthday, brother

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.159
John 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 in your Bible this morning as you know throughout the year

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.920
Here in 2020 our theme has been looking unto Jesus

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.479
We systematically studied through the book of Hebrews and as we studied through the book of Hebrews

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:33.880
Of course, as you know as you've been with us, we finished up last Sunday and what a joy

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.799
To that it was for me

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:42.200
I hope it was a joy for you to study through the book of Hebrews and to be encouraged to be challenged to be strengthened

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.599
And as we study the Word of God

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:48.680
We know that the Bible tells us that faith come of my hearing and hearing by the Word of the Lord of the Word of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.040
God and I'm so thankful that through studying the Word of God that our faith is increased and we serve a wonderful Savior

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.959
Amen, and I know I've shared this before with you that several

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.639
in the places in which we go we have to wear masks and all that sort of thing and so I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
purchased a couple of masks that have

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:11.419
Some some some sayings on them. One of them says Jesus loves you

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.800
and one of them says Jesus saves and I get occasionally some people that look at me and

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:19.519
Say I like your mask

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.919
I appreciate that message and then I have other people that look at me like I want to tear that mask off your face and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.000
The thing that's amazing and I thought about this week

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.160
I had some of those that just kind of looked at me funny this week with either of those masks on and I thought this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.239
The reality is that Jesus does love you and I you don't have to believe it

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.160
but I wish you would and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.040
I'm so thankful to know the love of God and to know the truth of the Word of God as they were singing the song

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:50.879
That we can trust his word. It will not fail

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.919
Amen, and what a blessing to know the truth of the Word of God to have the privilege of studying the Word of God

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:00.160
And as we've had for our theme and obviously all of these

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:06.239
expressions throughout the book of Hebrews how Christ is superior he's better and he is and

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.199
The the believers there that are being addressed the original recipients. They are being

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520
Just the evidence is is just so

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.479
Convincing I mean it's an

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.440
overwhelming amount of evidence to prove that Jesus Christ is superior and how important it is for us as the people of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.479
God as we go through life as we journey life that we turn our eyes upon the Lord that we seek his face that we

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.320
understand that though the things around us may be confusing there may be

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:42.559
Conflict and contention and chaos and all of those things that our God is in control

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.080
Our God is sovereign and we need to look to him this morning

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.000
I've asked you to turn to 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 and we're gonna look at verses 1 through 30

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:57.720
As we examine this passage of scripture that records for us an event from the reign of Jehoshaphat

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.240
He's king of Judah. And if you know some things about Jehoshaphat, we understand this morning that if we were to categorize

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.080
Kings of Judah and say there were some good kings and there were some bad kings

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.440
Jehoshaphat I think would fall in that category as being basically a good king

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.399
obviously, not everything in his life is is worthy of emulation of

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:28.360
Exemplary conduct so on and so forth. He actually made a couple of really bad decisions in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.679
He's really just following a really bad decision in which he made affinity with Ahab

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.440
That will not be the content of what we'll study this morning

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.119
but we find that as we come to the 20th chapter of 2nd Chronicles that we have this opportunity of

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:50.240
Reading an event in the life of Jehoshaphat that I think will help us as we're able to relate to this

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.419
Individual to this man that yes, he was the king of Judah

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:58.240
But he was facing a great difficulty look at it in verse 1 with me

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.119
the Bible says it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.220
Beside the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.799
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.239
Against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria and behold

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:29.399
They be in hazes on Tamar which is in getting look down at verse number 12

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.320
If you will and the Bible says this Oh

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.519
our God

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:36.519
Will thou not judge them?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.079
For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
Neither know we what to do

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:48.239
But our eyes are

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.559
upon

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:50.839
thee

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:56.559
This morning. I want to preach a message that I've simply titled from the end of verse number 12. Our eyes are

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.959
upon

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:00.440
thee our eyes are

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:08.760
Upon thee sometimes I think as we look at the declaration in verse number 12, we can relate we have no might no strength

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.320
no power

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.200
Given the circumstances the situation which we're facing. In fact, we might say as Jehoshaphat said we don't even know what to do

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.079
But here's what we're doing. Our eyes are upon

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.519
Thee notice with me as we study through this passage of Scripture number one

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:28.679
If you're taking notes consider the dilemma Jehoshaphat faced

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:34.559
He faces a dilemma, of course, we know what dilemmas are problems trials difficulties

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.880
Those things that we wish we didn't have to deal with quite honestly those things that come into our lives that we say

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.359
It'd be better if we didn't have to deal with this right now. I don't have time for this. It's not a good season

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:50.480
It's whatever and we have these dilemmas these trials these

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.079
Times of difficulty that we face in our lives and we find that Jehoshaphat is facing such a dilemma

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:02.119
I want you to understand. This isn't the first time this man ever faced a dilemma

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.480
This isn't the first time there was ever any type of military campaign that he would be involved with and yet we find that in

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.339
This particular text of Scripture the severity of this dilemma

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:17.519
Reveals to us great truth that I hope would be a help to us

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.119
We find as we've read already in verses 1 & 2

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:24.019
that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon they form a

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:31.019
Coalition and they come and they've already crossed the Bible tells us in verse number two that someone came to tell Jehoshaphat

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:33.059
There was a messenger that brought this message

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.019
They've already come this great multitude against thee from beyond the sea of this side Syria

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.380
and we find that they were coming no doubt for the purpose of attacking and

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.980
Conquering they weren't coming to just bring kind greetings

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.019
They weren't coming to try to have a little brief skirmish and then just let's go home

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:56.299
No, they were coming to attack and to conquer and no doubt. This was a very serious situation

00:06:56.299 --> 00:07:02.619
We find the Bible says in verse number two notice how this coalition is described as a great

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:08.459
Multitude we find that Jehoshaphat himself while he's praying in verse number 12

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:12.980
He will refer to this great multitude as a great company

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.980
And then we find in verse number 15 of our text of Scripture that the Lord

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:25.059
Gives answer and the the Prophet is speaking to Jehoshaphat and God says be not afraid nor dismayed

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.940
by reason of this great

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:35.459
Multitude and so when we look at the passage of Scripture and we see that can and we consider the dilemma in which

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.660
Jehoshaphat was facing we understand here this morning

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:42.459
It's a great multitude. It's a great company

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:48.339
It wasn't just that the messenger described this coalition in this manner

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.420
The messenger describes as a great a great multitude

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:00.019
Jehoshaphat says it's a great company and God says it's a great multitude. You know, there are times in our lives that we can

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:06.940
Embellish the difficulty in which we're dealing with. Amen. We can look at something and say this is the biggest trial

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.579
I've ever faced in my life and sometimes we get to the other side of it

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:14.220
We say, you know, it really wasn't that bad or we face something more difficult and say, you know

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.700
That thing that we faced really was just a walk in the park and we find here

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.459
however, that it was not a situation in which

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.140
Jehoshaphat is simply

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.820
Embellishing his dilemma God calls it a great multitude this great coalition

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.299
That is coming against Jehoshaphat king of Judah

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:40.020
And of course the people of Judah now understand with me as we look at the passage of Scripture how this dilemma

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Impacted how it affected

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.780
Jehoshaphat as we begin reading verse number three, the Bible says and Jehoshaphat

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:50.140
feared

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.380
You ever fear the things that you might face? I understand the Bible's full of fear not fear thou not

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.900
We studied as we've been studying through the book of Genesis

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.099
We will finish up the 15th chapter of Genesis this evening

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:08.419
But when you began Genesis 15 in verse number one, we find that God in that memorable greeting to Abram

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:10.419
He says Abram fear not

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:14.700
But there are times in our lives as human beings that we fear

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.460
It's an emotion that we have and there are times in which we fear in

00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:24.219
Jehoshaphat here in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20 in verse number 3 when he's faced with this dilemma

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:27.419
We find that the Bible tells us that he feared

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.380
the the

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:37.500
Important thing that we need to know as we study this passage of Scripture this morning is how is it that we respond?

00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:39.020
in time of fear

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:45.940
How is it that we respond with dilemmas that we face in time of difficulty in time of trial?

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.739
When we have that fear, how does it does it cripple us?

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:55.820
Does it cause us to just begin to make all sorts of decisions that that are not appropriate?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Decisions we find that the fear that Jehoshaphat

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.800
experiences in this passage of Scripture

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.780
caused him to seek God.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.320
And I mean, that's powerful.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.860
It's such an imperative truth

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.520
for us to grasp this morning

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800
because v. 3 says that Jehoshaphat

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.980
feared and set himself to seek the Lord

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.780
and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.260
Fasting in the Word of God

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.220
as we've mentioned throughout the years

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.100
is a sign of really the seriousness

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.500
of the individual seeking the Lord.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.180
He's not only seeking God through prayer,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.660
but he's proclaimed this fast.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.500
Why?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.140
Because they're serious about what's going on

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.580
and through this prayer,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.180
this seeking and this fasting,

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.940
they're demonstrating their seriousness

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.900
with regard to the situation.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.860
And so we find that the fear

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.600
that Jehoshaphat would experience

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.100
because of this dilemma

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.560
properly drove him to the Lord.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.980
Sometimes we get to the place in our lives,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.140
and I understand that even as we studied

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.420
in Hebrews 13 just a few weeks ago,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.860
when we understand that our God is with us,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.960
He said, I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.620
And then we can say that we're not gonna fear

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.940
what man can do unto us.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.780
Why?

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.460
Because God is my helper.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.300
But even though we understand that biblical truth,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.960
I would submit to you this morning

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.020
that there are times even as the people of God

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.660
that circumstances will invade your life

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.540
and invade my life that will cause us

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.820
to respond with fear.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.700
But what do we do in that time of fear?

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.880
Oh, we seek God.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.380
And we begin to have Him remove those fears, right?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.420
Because we're focused upon Him

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.660
and we're seeking Him

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.700
and we're seeing how He will work

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.700
in and through the situation.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.460
So number one, we consider the dilemma.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.100
Number two, notice the declaration of Jehoshaphat.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.580
Over the next several verses,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.820
we find this response of Jehoshaphat to this dilemma.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.060
And as we begin to just dissect,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.140
really verses three through 13,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.740
and begin to look at this prayer

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.780
and this proclamation, this declaration,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.300
as I have termed it,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.820
we find that not only is it impactful for us

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.020
as the people of God,

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.420
but I would submit to you this morning

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.780
that it's exemplary.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.500
It's a great example for us to begin to see the fact

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.540
that this man, Jehoshaphat,

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.860
though he's the king of Judah,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.300
he's facing a serious situation.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.020
It's a real dilemma in which he is facing.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.020
The nation is in a situation

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.880
in which they are now going to seek God

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.300
because of this coalition that's been formed.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.460
And I want you to notice the response.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.220
We see in verse three, as I've already made note,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.780
that he sought the Lord and proclaimed a fast.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.460
It continues in verse number four.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.540
And Judah gathered themselves together

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.580
to ask help of the Lord.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.780
Even out of all the cities of Judah,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.140
they came to seek the Lord.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.380
There's really a couple of things

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.660
that I noticed in verse number four.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.060
Number one, I noticed the influence of King Jehoshaphat.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.060
I noticed that King Jehoshaphat,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.020
in verse number two,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.220
as he received word about this coalition

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.300
that was formed against them,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.580
and he understood the purpose

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.480
in which they were coming to attack and to conquer,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.820
that Jehoshaphat proclaimed a fast around all Judah.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.540
And the Bible says that Judah gathered themselves together.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.820
This man was an influential leader

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.640
in the nation of Israel, appropriately so.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.580
He's the king.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.860
He should have influence, amen.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.180
And we find that he's influencing these people,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.820
the children of Israel, the inhabitants of Judah,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.460
to seek God.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.220
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.500
even out of all the cities of Judah,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.060
they came to seek the Lord.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:45.940
What were they seeking?

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.260
Well, the Bible tells us they were asking help of the Lord.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.180
And, you know, I'm so thankful that the Lord is our helper.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.980
There are times in which, in our life,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.420
we feel like we can handle the circumstances,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.320
the situations, the dilemmas that come into our lives.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.420
We feel that we have the ability to handle this thing,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.860
but we must find ourselves as the people of God

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.020
to understand how important it is

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.460
that we are dependent upon the Lord

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.980
and that we ask Him for help.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.380
You ever in a situation where you are just

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.460
so reluctant to ask for help,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.020
yet there's help that's just close by?

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.380
And maybe you just work and work and work

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.900
and you try to figure something out

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.900
and you're just working, working, working

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.140
and toiling and rowing,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.300
as the Bible talks about the disciples.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.220
They're toiling and rowing.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.060
You know what I mean?

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.260
I mean, in my mind's eye, I see it, right?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.140
They're rowing as hard as they,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.660
and they're not going anywhere.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.380
Jesus came by and they invite him on the ship.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.220
And guess what?

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.060
They're on the other side.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.540
It's amazing.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.460
So we just ask God for help.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.700
He is our helper.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.180
The psalmist declares, help, Lord.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.140
And there are times in which

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.020
that's exactly what we need to do.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.220
And they sought the Lord for the express purpose

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.780
of asking help of the Lord.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.020
Look at verse number five,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.460
as we continue looking through here.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.980
And we understand that in these next few verses

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.740
of scripture, really in verses five through 11,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.060
that as Jehoshaphat is praying,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.260
that as we read these words,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.500
we find that it's revealing to us

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.740
the knowledge that he has of God and of his word.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.220
I would submit to you this morning

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.300
that it's imperative as us, as the people of God,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.860
to be people of the book,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.500
that we know the God of the Bible,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.100
that we know the word of God.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.940
Listen, when we understand that he's able to do

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.140
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.180
when we understand that he said,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.260
call unto me and I will answer thee

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.820
and show thee great and mighty things

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.820
which thou knowest not,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.060
when we understand the promises of the word of God,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.060
it will cause us to run to him for help.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.460
We've been singing our theme song since June

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.020
from Psalm 121.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.340
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.540
from whence cometh my help.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.740
My help cometh from the Lord,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.060
which made heaven and earth.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.620
When I understand that he said,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.460
let there be light and there was light,

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.540
when I understand that he created everything

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.460
out of nothing that he said and it was done,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.460
man, it causes me to understand

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.180
that he's able to help me

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.980
and he's able to help you.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.340
Notice in verse number five,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.900
the Bible says that Jehoshaphat stood

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.100
in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.940
in the house of the Lord before the new court

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.980
and said, this is where the prayer begins,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.340
oh Lord God of our fathers,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.100
art not thou God in heaven

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.100
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.180
and in thine hand is there not power and might

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.300
so that none is able to withstand thee.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.860
Notice in verse number six that he, Jehoshaphat,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.860
understands that our God is sovereign

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.660
and that he is omnipotent.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.740
You understand this morning as we consider

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.020
the event and the life of Jehoshaphat,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.340
but even as we begin to make application

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.020
for our own lives today and think about

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.220
the dilemmas that we face,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.780
maybe as individuals, maybe as families,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.300
maybe as a church, maybe as a nation,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.340
we begin to see the dilemmas that we face

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.500
and we must recognize this morning

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.300
that the word of God reveals to us

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.140
that our God is sovereign,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.460
that our God is the omnipotent God

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.700
and that he reigns, that there is nothing

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.700
that's too hard for him.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.620
And we find that Jehoshaphat, as he's praying,

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.660
he's recognizing that again, it reveals to us

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.980
his knowledge of who God is.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.740
In verse number seven, art not thou our God?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.940
You notice the personal relationship.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.500
He's our God.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.700
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.180
It says here, who didst drive out the inhabitants

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.380
of this land before thy people Israel

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.380
and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever?

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.100
We find that God has worked mightily

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.780
on the behalf of his people

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.100
and here Jehoshaphat would rehearse

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.220
that which had been really the understanding

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.140
of the start of the nation of Israel

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.540
and the promise to Abram as we'll be studying

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.660
even this evening in Genesis chapter number 15

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.580
and we've studied over the last several passages

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.860
of scripture in the book of Genesis

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.100
with regard to the promise that God gave to Abram

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.940
and as we notice here that Jehoshaphat

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.380
is aware of those things.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.380
He's aware of the mighty acts of God.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.820
I wonder this morning, how often do we rehearse

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.140
what God has done?

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.340
When we face a dilemma, when we face a difficulty

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.180
and we go to God in prayer,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.180
I wonder how our faith is encouraged, increased.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.660
I wonder how our fear is decreased

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.340
when we just rehearse what God has done.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.620
When we're mindful of the mighty acts of our God.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.100
Our God is amazing and he's done some amazing things

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.140
and he's recorded for us in this precious book

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.700
so many amazing miracles that are impactful for us

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.820
as the children of God.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.460
In your life and in my life, God has worked miracles.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.340
God has answered prayer in your life

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.780
and that encourages you.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.260
He's seen you through the storm before

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.540
and it caused you to have great comfort

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.900
and great confidence and faith knowing

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.820
that he's with you even in the midst of the trouble,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.820
the dilemma that you're facing today.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:16.740
We find that the prayer continues,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.740
notice in verse number eight,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.020
and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.140
therein for thy name saying,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.140
if when evil cometh upon us as the sword,

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.980
judgment or pestilence or famine,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.820
we stand before this house and in thy presence

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.020
for thy name is in this house

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.860
and cry unto thee in our affliction,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.340
notice this last phrase,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.059
then thou wilt hear and help.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.140
Jehoshaphat knew that that's what God had said.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.820
You look at the declaration, the proclamation,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.340
the dedication of the temple under the reign of Solomon

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.740
and you read all of that, which is taking place,

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.500
obviously the building of the temple,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.900
you get into 2 Chronicles.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.740
6 and 7, and you read the prayer of Solomon into all the activities and

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.420
festivities, if you will, that surrounded the dedication of the temple, and then

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:15.180
how God answers, I've heard thy prayer, is what God says to Solomon in chapter

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.580
number 7, and we find that within the context of those chapters that Jehoshaphat

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.660
is mindful of that promise, and he's saying, here's what we're doing. You said

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.980
if when these evil things come, that if we come to this place and if we cry unto

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:34.600
thee in our affliction, that you will hear and help. Therefore, based upon what

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.620
you have said in your word, God, we're here asking you for help. Amen? And listen,

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.700
if you don't know the Word of God, you're not gonna know that you can go to him

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.020
for help, right? And so we find that Jehoshaphat, with facing this dilemma,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.620
with dealing with this difficulty, his knowledge of who God is, but also his

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.900
knowledge of what God has said, that God wants to be your helper. Listen, we

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.500
understand the psalmist has declared this throughout the Psalms, and we've

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.380
studied many of them as we've had the opportunity to speak about the truth

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.340
that our God is our helper, and we think about this truth, you don't need to turn

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.500
there, but in Psalm 46 and verse number 1, the psalmist declares God is our

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:24.420
refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. He's not only able to help,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.220
he's available to help. Have you ever known somebody that's able to help, but

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.240
they just don't have any availability? You need help with a project, and you

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.420
know so-and-so can help you, because they have the know-how, but they're just

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.060
simply not available. They're busy, they have other appointments, they have other

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.980
tasks that they're working on. That never happens with God. He's a very present

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.100
help in the time of trouble. It's interesting what the psalmist continues

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.700
to say in Psalm 46 and verses 2 and 3. He says, therefore, based upon our

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.060
understanding that God is our refuge and our strength and a very present

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.660
help in trouble, will not we fear, though the earth be removed and though the

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.100
mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.500
and be troubled, though the mountains shake with swelling, thereof,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.020
selah. That word selah in the book of Psalms is a precious word. It means to

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:20.020
stop and meditate and muse upon and allow it to sink in. Someone over the

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.300
years, many people have asked me how much of the Bible should they read every day

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.500
and that sort of thing, and kind of developing a Bible reading program and a

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.860
schedule and so on and so forth, and I've often told people that the

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.940
quality of your time with the Lord is of more importance than the quantity of the

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.940
number of verses or chapters that you read. There are times, and I hope that

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.180
you've experienced this as a child of God, there are times that God will arrest

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.380
your attention upon one verse of Scripture and you just simply don't get

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.540
any further than that one verse. But oh, you had a hallelujah time with the Lord

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.460
on that day, you understand what I mean. And the reality this morning is that we

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.540
can, when we look at the the psalmist and we say, selah, listen, we stop and we

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.380
meditate and we think about this, we say, listen, this is impactful truth. And see,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.340
Jehoshaphat, back in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 20, he knew that God had

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.700
said this. What was it that caused him, in light of the dilemma, in light of the

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.020
difficulty that he was facing, why is it that he proclaimed this fast? Why is it

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.140
that he sought the Lord? Why did he bring the people? Because he knew that God said

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:34.980
that if you seek me, I will hear and I will help. What did the songwriter say in

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.580
the song that the the girls, Holly and Julianne and Brianna, played for us?

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:49.660
His word will not fail you. It won't. God is not a man that he should lie. Every

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.820
promise of God in him is yea. These promises are exceeding great and

00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.420
precious promises. And we find that this man, Jehoshaphat, what a great

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:06.540
example for us. He's saying, in simple faith, his actions are saying, I believe

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.340
you, God. And here's why we're here. Continue, look in verse number 10,

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:16.340
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldst

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.020
not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:26.460
from them and destroyed them not. Behold, I say, how they reward us to come to cast

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:32.220
us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. In verses 10 and 11,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.340
not only does it reveal to us again more of the knowledge that Jehoshaphat has

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.420
of the historical events, but it also reveals to us the transparency of

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:45.700
Jehoshaphat. You know, did God already know this? Sure he did. Our God is

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.140
all-knowing. He's omniscient. He already knew what they were facing. He already knew

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.740
those that were gathered against. He knew about this great company, this great

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.220
multitude. But you understand that there's something beneficial for us, as

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.540
the people of God, to be transparent with God and to just pour our heart out to

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.580
him and say, God, here's the specific issue that I'm facing. Here's

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.940
the specific difficulty, dilemma, that I'm dealing with in my life. For Jehoshaphat,

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.220
in this text of Scripture, specifically, the dilemma is that there's a coalition

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.460
that's formed against them, Moab and Ammon and others along with them, and

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.100
they're coming to attack and conquer. So what does Jehoshaphat do? I'm being

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.900
transparent with God. Here's my problem, God. Hezekiah, when the Assyrians

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.460
come in, Rabshakeh's coming and telling them, as the representative of

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.100
Sennacherib, he's coming and saying, here's what we're gonna do, here's what

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.180
we're gonna do, and letters were written. What does he do? He goes and he lays it

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.020
out before the Lord. God, here's what they're saying. Not only is it what

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.540
they're saying, what they're saying is true. They've conquered all of these

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:58.500
surrounding nations. They do have great power, but God, you're the Lord of the

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:05.740
universe. These other nations, they serve false gods, but we serve you. Hezekiah

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.460
lays it out before the Lord. And I would say to you this morning, as we look at

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.780
this passage of Scripture, and we've made note that it was a—not only do we

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:22.620
see that through this impactful event, it's exemplary. We find that we're in

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.300
that place of, hey, let us get before the Lord and just pour our heart out to God

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:32.460
and just be honest with God. He knows anyway, but there's something beneficial

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:38.940
about us saying it to God and just letting him know. We continue as we find

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.220
that he's stated the problem, and we see this declaration as we read for—by way

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.860
of introduction for our title this morning, but look in verses 12 and

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:57.020
13 again with me. Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.020
against this great company that cometh against us. I find in that first

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.740
statement that is there, and he continues by saying, neither know we what to do,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.500
that it's a recognition of their inability. You know that requires

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.620
humility. In your pride and in my pride, we want to figure that we can take care

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:22.820
of it. We got this. We can handle this. But the reality is that when we find in

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.540
this declaration in the first, really two-thirds of verse number 12, that

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:33.940
Jehoshaphat is in his declaration, he's recognizing his inability. We have no

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.420
strength, we have no might, we have no power against this great company. We're

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.820
saying, we're just—we're not fit for this battle. We're not able. And furthermore,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.940
we just flat-out don't know what to do. Have you ever been there? You just don't

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:53.180
know what to do. Sometimes—and I'll be very transparent with you—sometimes I

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.020
pray to the Lord in these type of terms, and I say, Lord, I'm not smart enough to

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.620
know how to figure this thing out. You just need to make it extremely plain and

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.420
clear to me, because I'm just not smart enough. He said, I can't believe—you're not smart

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.260
enough either, amen? Seriously, we don't know the end from the beginning, but we

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:16.180
know the one who does. So would it not be foolish of us to think that we can

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.940
handle all of our problems? No. We go to God and say, I don't know what to do. And

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.980
that's what Jehoshaphat does. He says, we don't have the power, the might, we don't

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:38.660
have the ability, and we don't know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. What a

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:48.059
precious statement. Our eyes are upon thee. This, as we would say that it was a

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:51.940
recognition of their inability in the first part of the verse, we'd say in the

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.220
latter part of the verse that it's a declaration of their dependence. John 15,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.700
we find that Jesus teaches the disciples, and of course for us to have the

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.900
understanding of that teaching, that without Him we can do nothing. The

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.900
songwriter said, I need thee every hour, and I know I've often said not to try to

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.220
one-up or correct the songwriter, but the reality is that we need Him every second

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:24.140
of every minute of every hour. We need God. And here the the King of Judah, He

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:31.500
says, our eyes are upon thee. In the dilemma that you're facing, we know the

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.180
dilemma that Jehoshaphat is facing, it's historical record, it's for us to be able

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.340
to examine, but God's Word is given to us, not just for a history lesson, God's

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.580
Word is given to us so that we can apply in our own lives. What's the dilemma that

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:48.260
you're facing? What's our difficulty that we're dealing with today, and have we

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.140
come to the place of declaring our inability and declaring our dependence

00:29:53.140 --> 00:30:02.220
upon God? God, our eyes are upon thee. All year, look

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:09.700
unto Jesus. Turn your eyes upon Jesus, they sang this morning. We've just

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.940
gone through and began to understand the significance and the importance of us

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.580
trusting God. Listen, He is the author and finisher of our faith. He is just, I mean,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.900
He's amazing. And as we begin to see how that Jehoshaphat would make this

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.780
declaration, we find in verse number 13 that all Judah stood before the Lord

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.140
with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Oh, how important verse

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.540
number 13 is. Can I submit to you this morning that husbands, your wives need to

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.500
know that you're trusting God. Parents, your children need to know that you're

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:51.900
trusting God. Listen, our families need to understand that we are seeking God.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.860
Their little ones, their wives, their children, the families were there. They

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:01.260
were gathered together in seeking the Lord, and we find the power of that, and

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.020
the importance of that. Listen, why is it we have people that are writing books

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.740
and dealing with all of this sort of thing, how that we're losing a

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.380
generation in our churches, and can I tell you that for the most part they're

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:21.060
right, we are. Why? Somewhere we've lost it. There's been a disconnect. And the

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.180
reality is that here in verse number 13, when we think about this influence, when

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.860
we think about the the setting and all that was taking place, and how important

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:35.060
it is for the children to know that we are seeking God for help, that we're

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:40.700
dependent upon Him. Not only do we consider the dilemma, and notice the

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.500
declaration as we finish up the passage of Scripture this morning, I want you to

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.220
rejoice in the deliverance of the Lord. I know that our time is kind of, I took too

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.140
long on 13 verses, but let's look at verse 14 down through verse 30. Then upon

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.460
Jehaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jael, the son of

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:06.260
Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:12.860
of the congregation, and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and the inhabitants of

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:19.940
Jerusalem, and thou, King Jehoshaphat, thus saith the Lord unto you. Now that's

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.980
exciting, because the Lord is answering their prayer. Remember what he said in

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.860
verse number nine, that then that will hear and help, and God is answering the

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.460
prayer. He's heard the prayer of his people, and Jehoshaphat has influenced,

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.020
and he's led the nation of Judah in seeking the face of God, and now the

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.700
Lord is speaking, the Lord is giving an answer. Notice what he says in verse 15,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:50.860
Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, for the battle is

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:59.020
not yours, but God's. Oh, how we could focus so much of our time upon that last

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:05.940
statement of verse number 15. The battle is not yours, but God's. We find this

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:12.020
morning that we are engaged in spiritual warfare. We see it so evidenced in our,

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.100
just the day and age in which we're living, we see it all around us,

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.260
the evidence of this spiritual warfare, this spiritual battle that we're engaged

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.500
in, and we understand that we must recognize that it is a spiritual battle.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.020
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, against spiritual wickedness in high

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.380
places. That's what Paul says to the believers at Ephesus in Ephesians

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.700
chapter number 6, and we are to be strong in the Lord and the power of his

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.900
might. If God be for us, who can be against us? We are more than conquerors

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.340
through Christ, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:51.780
Lord Jesus Christ. Listen, what a joy to know that God is the Lord God omnipotent

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.460
and that he rules and reigns, and we are, as the songwriter said and Dr. Curtis

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:03.260
Hudson often sang, we are on the winning side. What a joy that is. It says in verse

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:09.180
number 16, tomorrow, go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by the cliff

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.340
of Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.940
Jerul. Now, I'm thankful God didn't stop there and just tell him where he's gonna

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.580
find them, but he continues and gives him more information. Verse 17, ye shall not

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.220
need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.980
salvation of the Lord with you. O Judah and Jerusalem, fear not, nor be dismayed.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:37.540
Tomorrow, go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. We notice several

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.580
things in verse number 17. We find that he says, stand ye still and see the

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.420
salvation of the Lord. We are mindful of that truth when Moses says to the

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.940
children of Israel as they were to cross over the Red Sea, stand still and see the

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.060
salvation of the Lord, and then they're told to go forward and they cross over

00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:00.220
on dry ground. We find here that he says here that they're not to fear on two

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.740
occasions. In verse 15, again in verse number 17, he says, fear not, nor be

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:10.740
dismayed. He tells them again, and what a great reminder for us to be aware of the

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:19.500
presence of God, for the Lord will be with you. The Lord will be with you. Verse

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.260
18, and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.740
the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. And the

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.300
Levites, and the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.820
Korhites, stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high, and

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.180
they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. And

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.300
as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, hear me, O Judah, and the

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.700
inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.020
established. Believe his prophets, so shall you prosper. And when he had

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.660
consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.300
praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say,

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.980
praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever. It's interesting as you look at

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.020
verses 18 through 21, and really the first statement, verse 22, that we'll

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:16.100
look at in just a moment, you see the rejoicing. It's impactful. Before the

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.500
actual deliverance, they're rejoicing in what God is going to do. Why? Because

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.300
they're so certain that what God has said he was going to do, that he will do,

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:34.500
that they can rejoice before it even happens. That's amazing. It's also

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:41.940
something that we should do in our lives. It reminds me of what Paul tells

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:47.180
the believers in Philippi, in Philippians chapter number 4, and verse number 6, and

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.000
often we quote the verse of Scripture, but we find here that the Bible says, be

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.500
careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.220
Let your requests be made known unto God. And here in verses 18 through 21, the

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:08.020
people are worshiping the Lord. They're praising the Lord. We find that

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.700
Jehoshaphat again stands up in verse 20, and he says, believe in the Lord your

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:19.120
God. Have faith. Believe what God has said. In verse 21, they're there and they're

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.500
praising the beauty of holiness, that they're praising the Lord and the beauty

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.100
of his holiness, and it says, praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever. And

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.300
notice verse 22, the beginning of the verse, it says, and when they began to

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:35.520
sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:41.740
Moab and Mount Seir. You understand that God loves to receive our praise. He does.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:49.900
And they're praising God before they find the coalition dead. They soon are

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:56.820
going to find the coalition dead, but their rejoicing precedes the evidence of

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.820
what God said he would do. Why? They had faith. They just believed that God was

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.220
going to work, that God was going to do what he said he was going to do. We find

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.540
in verse 22, he sets the ambushments. It says that at the end of the verse, which

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:14.260
were come against Judah, and they were smitten. We see the response as we

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.060
consider this final point of rejoicing in the deliverance of the Lord. We see

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.460
how the Lord responds, but we also see the rejoicing of the people of God. And

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.420
then we read of the victory. The Bible ends verse 22 by saying, and they were

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.380
smitten. Notice in verse 23 and down through verse number 24, the record of

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.660
the defeat of this coalition. It says, for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.180
against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them. And

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.500
when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.220
destroy another. And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness,

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.860
they looked unto the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:57.460
the earth, and none escaped. Verse 25, and when Jehoshaphat and his people came

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.020
to take away the spoil of them, they found among them an abundance both

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.060
riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels, which they stripped off for

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:10.100
themselves. Notice this, more than they could carry away. And they were three

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.540
days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. That reveals to us in verse

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:18.380
number 25 a couple of things. Number one, it reveals to us the size of this

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.140
coalition. Remember, the messenger said it was a great multitude. Remember,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.940
Jehoshaphat says it's a great company, and God, through the prophets, says it's

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:32.220
a great multitude. We find that it reveals to us that as Jehoshaphat had

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.380
rightly proclaimed to the Lord, we don't have any might against this great

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.340
company, we don't know what to do. The Bible tells us in verse number 25, there

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.580
was so much spoil that they couldn't carry it away. There weren't enough of

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.260
them to carry away the spoil. Furthermore, it took them three days. It says that, and

00:39:51.260 --> 00:40:00.380
they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. Sometimes God will

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.340
bring you to a dilemma, a difficulty.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.500
that's just absolutely 100% beyond anything you could even imagine doing.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:16.460
Why? Because that's when God gets the glory. That's when God gets the glory. We

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.380
understand that in the life of Gideon. We speak about it often. God says to Gideon,

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.020
nope, if I give you the victory with that many people, you guys are gonna say you

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.100
got the victory. So I need to bring it down. Just tell them if they don't want

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.260
to fight, go home. And a bunch of them went home. You understand they were

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:44.580
already outnumbered before the army was decreased in size. Vastly outnumbered.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.460
God says if they don't, if they want to go home, they don't want to fight, let

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.740
them go home. Why'd all those rascals go home? Because they knew they were

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:56.820
outnumbered. We're going home. And then God said it's still too many. Here's what I

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.740
want you to do. And we know the account. We know what, Judges 6 through 8, read the

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.460
chapters. And you can see all that God does. But what God is doing is saying,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:10.940
listen, God works in these moments of impossibility so that he would be

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:16.340
glorified. So that it's not explained as, well, that was the the wisdom and might

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:21.260
of the King Jehoshaphat. He set this great plan in order, and he did this, and

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.100
he did that, and let's lift up King Jehoshaphat. No, no, no. King Jehoshaphat

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.620
said to the people, I don't know what to do. He said that to God. But the people

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.740
were there. Oh, but the leader, the king, is supposed to make it make it so

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.580
everybody thinks he knows what he's gonna do. Sometimes the leader doesn't

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:42.740
know what he's gonna do. And a good leader depends upon God. Because you

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:48.460
understand that even though someone's a leader, it doesn't make them have

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:56.260
infinite knowledge as God does. We're still human beings. And we find here that

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.340
Jehoshaphat, he's not gonna receive any glory for this victory. The people of

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.900
Judah aren't gonna have any any kind of glory for this victory. They didn't

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:12.500
do anything. Nothing. They just simply went and collected the spoils. When they

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:18.940
arrived, they were all dead. God had worked on their behalf. Notice with me,

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.300
not only was it a complete victory and the spoils are gathered, but they

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.060
returned to Jerusalem. In verse number 26, on the fourth day, they assembled

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:32.620
themselves in the valley of Barakah, for they, excuse me, for there they blessed

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.860
the Lord. Now, that's an important statement. Again, they were praising

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.900
God beforehand, but then don't forget to praise God afterwards as well. Amen?

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.100
They praised him before, but then when they actually experienced the victory

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:49.580
and got it, they blessed the Lord. Therefore, the name of the place, the same

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.980
place, was called the Valley of Barakah unto this day. I think that as we read

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.820
that statement throughout the scriptures, and especially you read it in the book

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:03.980
of Joshua in particular, unto this day, I think there's great significance in that

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.780
because I'm mindful of when the event took place and then when the record was

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.300
written and then reread, that unto that day it was still called the Valley of

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:20.100
Barakah, and what a great teaching tool and an opportunity of influence to say,

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.780
let me tell you what happened. How did this place get its name? You ever think

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.340
about that when you travel? You travel places, you begin to travel the world,

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.340
what's the significance of this town? How did this town get its name? How did this

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.860
place get to be called this? Well, in the Valley of Barakah, let me tell you what

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.300
happened. There was a coalition, I'm not going to reveal or I'm not going to

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.140
recite everything I just said, but you understand, right? What a great

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:47.740
opportunity. Verse 27, then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem and

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:54.380
Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem, how? With joy. How

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:59.940
did Jehoshaphat start in verse number three? With fear. With fear. But it was an

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.180
honest situation. Sometimes we can say, I'm not afraid, but inside you know you're

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:11.740
afraid, right? And here it says they returned with joy. Why? For the Lord had

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:17.220
made them to rejoice over their enemies. They came to Jerusalem with psalteries

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.260
and harps and trumpets under the house of the Lord. In your mind's eye, can you

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.540
see them returning? I mean, honestly, in your sanctified imagination, they're not

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.380
walking back like this, oh man, it was a long trip and I'm just, man, they're

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.980
coming back excited. I mean, they're rejoicing in what God has done and how

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:41.420
God has worked. And this was a time to exalt and magnify the Lord God Almighty

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:46.980
and they're returning with psalteries and harps and trumpets under the house

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.100
of the Lord. It's a big deal. And I think the people that were left back in

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:56.980
Jerusalem when they went out, the ones that were there, right? The wives and the

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:01.620
children. Can you imagine how they were feeling upon the return of the men as

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.620
they were coming back? And they're coming back with the spoils, but they're coming

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:11.100
back rejoicing. In verse number 29, the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.740
those countries when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.460
Israel. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:25.500
about. In verses 29 and 30, I notice in this passage the impact upon the

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.980
surrounding people groups, the surrounding nations. Can I tell you this

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:35.660
morning that when God works, not when we try to manufacture God working, but when

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.260
God works, people take note of that. The world understands. You understand that

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.940
during the revival ministry of many of those great evangelists in the beginning

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:50.420
of the 20th century of this nation, that there were people in communities that

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.660
feared those evangelists coming to their communities. Why? Because they knew that

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.620
the liquor stores and liquor places and the saloons and all of those places, all

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.980
of the places of ill report, they're gonna shut down. Because somebody's gonna

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.180
come in there, they're gonna preach the gospel, and people are gonna get saved,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.020
scores of people are gonna get saved, and it's gonna change the town. They were

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:11.900
fearful of it. Why? They were taking note of what God was doing and how God was

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:17.020
working. And I would submit to you this morning that as we put ourselves in the

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.260
position as Jehoshaphat did and the nation of Judah did, they say, we don't

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.940
know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. We're looking to you. We're trusting

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:31.660
you, God, in this moment of difficulty, in this dilemma that I'm facing. I'm trusting

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.660
you, and I'm asking you to work in such a way that you alone will be glorified.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:42.980
People are gonna notice, and it's important for us to give glory to God.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:47.420
Don't take this, yeah, well, you know, I figured it out. He didn't figure anything

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:53.780
out. Amen? Jehoshaphat didn't know where to go. In fact, God told him when to go

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:58.860
and where to go. He didn't leave anything open to Jehoshaphat's own figuring it

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:04.100
out. And this morning, as we think about this great passage in 2 Chronicles 20,

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.260
this event in the life of Jehoshaphat, I hope that we leave with more than just a

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:16.300
history lesson. I hope that we leave with saying, our eyes are upon thee. I understand

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:22.500
in a group of people, really of any size, there are dilemmas, there are

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:30.380
difficulties, there's opposition, there's problems, but our God is able to help.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:39.340
And we must declare, as Jehoshaphat did, our eyes are upon thee. Our eyes are upon

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:45.340
thee. I'm looking unto my Savior, understanding who He is, understanding

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:50.020
what He's done, understanding what He's promised, and I'm saying, God, would you

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.540
work? I was reading this morning in my own personal devotions to the book of

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.940
John, and once again, it's a familiar verse of Scripture, but once again, my

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.300
attention was focused upon that great declaration of John the Baptist in John

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.700
3 in verse 30, he must increase and I must decrease. Listen, it's all about God

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.860
being glorified. And as long as you're trying to figure out your own problems,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.380
and as long as you're trying to have somebody recognize how smart you are to

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.860
figure out all of your dilemmas in life, God's not gonna be glorified. And we

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:27.020
need to just simply come in simple faith and obedience and say, God, I don't have

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:32.580
the might, the strength, or the power. I don't have any idea what to do, but

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:38.100
here's what I'm doing. My eyes are on you. I'm seeking you. I'm asking you for help.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:44.420
And God is a very present help at the time of trouble. And he says, here's what

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.420
I want to do for you. Here's how I'm gonna work on your behalf. And he gives

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:53.500
us the victory. And then we say, thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:58.940
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Our eyes are upon thee. Father, we love you this

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.500
morning. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the opportunity to be

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.580
gathered together this morning for the purpose of worship. We thank you for the

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.740
opportunity to study this passage of Scripture, to be reminded of this

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:19.940
historical event during the reign of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. I believe this

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:26.260
morning in my own life that this record of 2 Chronicles 20 is impactful. It's

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:33.300
exemplary. The purpose of studying your Word is not to simply have a better

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:38.220
grasp or understanding of historical events or timelines, though we gain that

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.540
understanding. It's that we might be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.340
That we might take the truth and apply it in our lives. And I pray this morning

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:55.660
the Holy Spirit of God has moved and worked the lives of your people. No doubt

00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:06.300
there are dilemmas that we face. I pray that we would respond as Jehoshaphat

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:15.420
did and declare our dependence upon thee, would cause us to then rejoice in your deliverance,

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.980
to exalt and magnify your name.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.500
Understand this morning that the dilemmas that we face are quite different than that

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:28.100
which was faced by Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah on this particular day, but dilemmas

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.100
nonetheless.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.140
God we pray that you'd be exalted in our lives.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.020
There's one that does not know you as their personal Lord and Savior, it's our prayer

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.860
today that they would allow us to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.180
that heaven is their home.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:50.740
They would not leave this place without knowing for sure of their eternal destination.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.420
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee during this time of invitation.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.300
For it's in Christ's name we pray, would you stand with me?

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.260
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.620
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does, I'd invite you to respond

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.620
to the Lord.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.460
You can use your pew as an altar, you can come to this old-fashioned altar, but let

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.580
the Lord have His way in your life.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.500
Be a doer of the word and not a hearer only.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.060
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
