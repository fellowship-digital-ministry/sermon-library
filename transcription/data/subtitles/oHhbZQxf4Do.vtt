00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.099
37 this evening, Genesis chapter number 37 this evening.

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.480
And I've titled the message, Joseph was 17 years old.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.500
My Joseph is only 16.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
And I was thinking about that this week.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.460
And as I obviously were preparing

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.280
for Brianna's graduation party and all of those things,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.299
and then thinking about Joseph

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.819
as I'm writing and studying this message

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.899
and thinking about our youngest is 16,

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.139
it's amazing how quickly time goes by.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:28.340
And I was thinking about the life of Joseph

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.540
here in the Bible.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.500
It's interesting in Genesis chapter 36,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.220
we dealt with this chapter last week in Genesis chapter 36.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.459
The Bible talks about these are the generations of Esau.

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.180
And we looked at a number of things last week

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.299
from that portion of scripture and made some application

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.479
that I believe would be helpful for us to understand.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.900
As we get into Genesis chapter 37,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.340
you'll note that there's a term very similar

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.740
to what we see a phrase that we see

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.939
in verse number one of chapter 36.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.500
Here in chapter number 37, it's verse number two.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.059
And the Bible says these are the generations of Jacob.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.500
And so we saw in Genesis 36, the generations of Esau.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.379
Here in Genesis chapter number 37,

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.059
we will read of the generations of Jacob.

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.220
We find that specifically it is here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.019
that the lens of scripture will focus

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:19.900
upon the life of Joseph.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.980
Of course, we understand that from here,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.860
Genesis 37 through the end of the book, chapter number 50,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.419
every portion of the remaining chapters,

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.300
except for chapter 38,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.739
deal with some aspect of the life of Joseph.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.419
And what a godly young man,

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:41.760
what a man that was used for the glory of God.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.379
And many of you know, I've shared this over the years,

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:47.500
that Joseph is my favorite Bible character.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.620
And thus our son is not Christopher III,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.900
he is Joseph Christopher,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.540
just because of the significance

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.059
of the Bible character Joseph.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.660
It's hard to believe, in just about six weeks or so,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.500
we'll be here for 12 years as being the pastor,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.580
and I've never preached through the life of Joseph.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.059
And though he's my favorite Bible character,

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.660
the Lord's just never led me

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.779
and never given me that liberty or direction

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.500
to preach through the life of Joseph.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.460
And so I am so excited about the opportunity here

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.940
on Sunday evenings for the next several months

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.860
to be able to study through the life of Joseph.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.660
We first read of the character,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.699
the Bible character Joseph in Genesis chapter 30,

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.339
verses 22 through 24.

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.580
We won't take the time to turn back there,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.860
but it's there in those verses

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.020
that God records for us the birth of Joseph.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.259
And we read that from that point

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.699
until here in Genesis chapter number 37,

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.139
obviously 17 years past,

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.979
because the text tells us that he's 17 years old.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.979
There's only a couple of references

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.979
to the life of Joseph from Genesis chapter 30

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.660
to Genesis chapter number 37.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.699
And both of those are found in Genesis 32 and 33,

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.580
simply stating how that Jacob in preparing to meet Esau

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.740
put them in the back of the camp and so on and so forth.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.020
And so his name is just mentioned very briefly.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.580
And so nothing about him is given to us

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.259
as far as his life, his upbringing and so on and so forth.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.460
And so we come here to Genesis 37

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.500
and we read that he's 17 years old,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.899
but notice what the Bible tells us

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.339
beginning in verse number one.

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.580
And Jacob dwelt in the land

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.860
wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.100
These are the generations of Jacob.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.500
Joseph being 17 years old

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.619
was feeding the flock with his brethren.

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.740
The lad was with the sons of Bilhah

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.860
and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.860
and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.979
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.300
because he was the son of his old age.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.380
And he made him a coat of many colors.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.100
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.779
more than all his brethren,

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:03.779
they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.020
As we come to this text of scripture this evening,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.300
I just have two thoughts for you.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.580
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.619
notice with me the childhood of Joseph.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.660
We don't have much scripture that God would give us

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.579
the insight into the particulars

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.179
of Joseph's childhood, his upbringing.

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:23.760
But as we begin to think about the text of scripture here

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.779
and read that he's 17 years old,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.820
and we can understand as we've studied

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.200
through these chapters in the book of Genesis,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.920
we can piece things together

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.500
with regard to the childhood of Joseph.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.140
I do not believe that it's here in verse three and four

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.779
when he's 17 years old that it's first known to the family

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.700
that he was the most loved son.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.720
It is not the result of Joseph bringing unto his father

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.320
their evil report that he, Joseph,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.320
was given a coat of many colors.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.600
I believe that happened many years earlier in his life,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.859
and it was a known thing.

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:01.359
And as we begin to think about the childhood of Joseph,

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:04.320
we have made it known in previous messages,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.200
we've noted the fact that the family

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.200
that Joseph was brought up in obviously was dysfunctional.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.920
It was a dysfunctional family.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.100
We hear that term today kind of tossed around,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.500
and we understand what some would imply or mean

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.700
by that phraseology of being a dysfunctional family.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.820
But as you would go back,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.420
and we're not gonna take the time this evening to review it,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.299
but if you'd go back to Genesis chapter 29 and 30,

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:32.420
you would find that the conflict between Leah and Rachel

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.420
along with their handmaids is well-documented.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.579
We studied through those chapters in chapter 29 and 30,

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:41.459
and it was just, I mean, mind-blowing,

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.459
some of the things that were taking place within the family,

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.540
and just the conflict between Leah and Rachel

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.980
and all that was going on.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.739
And we think about that conflict,

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:55.940
and we know that Joseph is the son of Jacob's old age,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.579
and we know that he's the son of Jacob and Rachel,

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.019
but remember, Rachel was the one that was,

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:05.140
if you wanna use the term, the favorite wife, okay?

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.700
And so now, all of a sudden,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.579
he has this son from his favorite wife.

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:11.940
I mean, it's just a dysfunctional family.

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:17.059
We find that not only was it a dysfunctional family,

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.459
but he's there, he's born into the time of Jacob's life

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.540
when Jacob has already fled from the face of Esau,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.459
because Esau said, I'm gonna kill my brother

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:28.500
because he took the blessing.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.700
He's already stolen the birthright,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.619
now he's taking the blessing, and I'm gonna kill him,

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:36.140
and so Jacob has to go to Paddan Aram,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.420
and of course, it's there where Joseph would be born,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.700
and you think about the years there with Laban.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.540
They were turbulent years.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.619
I mean, they were difficult years.

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.420
All of the things that we've studied

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.980
and all that had taken place,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.459
and you begin to look at that timing

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.980
and Joseph being raised up,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.899
being brought up in that kind of a setting,

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.079
the childhood of Joseph.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.899
The family was divided.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.880
The text of Scripture makes it clear

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.880
that Joseph was loved more than all the other children.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.959
Now, that's a real problem.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.200
Sometimes we joke about who's a favorite child,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.220
and those of you that are only children,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.480
you just hold that title all to your own, right?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.640
But those that have siblings,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.799
my brother and I will tease with my parents,

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.640
my mom in particular, because it really bothers her,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.040
when we'll say that, well, we know he's your favorite,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.119
and so on and so forth.

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:40.040
But the reality is that this was legitimate

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.100
how their life and their upbringing was.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.480
This is what was going on in the home.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.040
It was known.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.359
And the Bible says in verse number three,

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:52.200
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.279
because he was the son of his old age,

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.079
and he made him a coat of many colors.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:00.760
No doubt, and we see obviously within the text of Scripture

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.899
that this love that Jacob had for Joseph

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:06.859
that surpassed the love that he had for his other children,

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:11.660
this would cause great conflict in the home.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.179
When I think about the conflict in the home,

00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:16.459
listen, I'm thankful that God has given us

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:19.459
instruction as word how that we can have a home

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:21.579
that is harmonious and melodious,

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:23.459
a home that honors the Lord,

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.459
where it can be void of conflict,

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:28.799
and when conflict would enter into a relationship,

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:31.779
whether that relationship is the home or some other entity,

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:33.419
that God has given us instruction

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.700
on how to resolve conflict.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.940
But we find that within the home of Jacob,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.700
there's all of this dysfunction,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.059
and this is how Joseph is raised.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:42.900
This is what he's seeing.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.739
This is what he's experiencing.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.619
And we find that in verse number four,

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:49.619
I want you to see what the Bible says.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.780
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.719
more than all his brethren,

00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:58.700
I think that they saw a whole lot more

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.559
than just a coat of many colors.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:05.500
They saw actions and behaviors and favors

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.599
and whatever it was,

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:11.599
they saw the evidence of this truth

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.580
that Jacob loved Joseph more than all of his children.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.780
It was obvious to them.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.039
And the Bible says that when they saw that,

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:22.919
notice what it says,

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.960
they hated him.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.159
They hated him.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:31.179
That's strong language.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.359
Not sure if any of you ever said when you were a child

00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:37.320
or if any of the children in here ever said something

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.880
about hating someone,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.280
but I know that if it was ever even spoken in our home,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.479
whether it was when I was a child or from our children,

00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:47.799
that language was not allowed.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:49.539
We didn't use that terminology.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.679
I've heard children say, well, I hate broccoli.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.280
No, no, no, you can just say you don't like it.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.080
We try to avoid that word,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.119
but think about.

00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:06.639
what is carried here with this context of God revealing to us that the Bible says that

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:14.559
they hated him. They hated him. Now, I want you to think about Joseph for just a moment.

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:18.119
Was there anything that he did to make his father love him more than any of the other

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:23.599
brethren? I mean, as far as we can tell, the Bible says here in verse number 3 that Jacob

00:10:23.599 --> 00:10:28.559
loved him more than all his other children. Why? Because he was the son of his old age.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:36.239
There was nothing that we can tell biblically that caused Joseph to have this elevated favor

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:41.239
and love from his father, but we find that the Bible tells us that it was obvious and

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:46.399
the brethren knew it, the brothers saw, and they were aware of this, and they hated him.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:53.139
I'm not sure if you've ever had somebody that's really disliked you. You take it to a level

00:10:53.139 --> 00:11:00.699
of hatred. It's beyond really maybe for many of us our ability to comprehend. And the Bible

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:08.979
says that they hated him, and notice how it's described here, and could not speak peaceably

00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:17.879
unto him. Now, can you imagine the dysfunction in this home? Can you imagine the childhood

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:24.919
of Joseph growing up in this setting, in this environment? The families, as we'll see, as

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:29.719
we'll note in just a moment, obviously as we understand the timing and all that's going

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:37.079
on at this particular era of history, they spent a lot of time together. They were close

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:43.759
to one another, and yet the Bible tells us that Joseph had to deal with this regular

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:55.079
animosity. They could not speak peaceably unto him. I can't imagine growing up in that

00:11:55.079 --> 00:12:06.199
fashion, honestly. I really can't. I'm sure that as a parent, I know we experienced this,

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:12.080
and I'm sure that as a parent you experienced, will my kids ever love each other? They fight

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:20.720
all the time. What's going on? But this is a whole other level. It's a whole other level.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.659
When I think about the childhood of Joseph, and we come to Genesis 37, and God introduces

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:31.399
us to Joseph, and what he tells us in verse number 2 about Joseph, reveals to me not only

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:34.879
as we would consider the childhood of Joseph, but I want you to think about the character

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:42.479
of Joseph. The character of Joseph. The Bible tells us in verse number 2, these are the

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:50.839
generations of Jacob. Joseph, being 17 years old, notice what the Bible says, was feeding

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:56.679
the flock with his brethren. As we begin to think about the character of Joseph, I would

00:12:56.679 --> 00:13:01.199
say first of all, that when we note the character of Joseph, that we must note that he was a

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:07.879
worker. He was a worker. The Bible says that he was feeding the flock. That's work. That's

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:14.080
labor. And I want you to think about the character. Listen, it takes a measure of character to

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.159
do hard work. We live in a time in which people seem to be allergic to hard work. It can drive

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:29.000
you crazy in the society in which we live. Honestly. The idea of just being a hard worker

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.159
is something that many times has slipped by in our society today. And we find that

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:39.759
here, as you look at the text of Scripture, that Joseph, he's only 17 years old, but he

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:44.119
was feeding the flock, and he's a hard worker. I believe that there was a measure of diligence

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:49.080
in his work. I believe that as he's working, and he's doing what he's been instructed to

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.839
do, that this is honoring to God. You know, we're to be hard workers. What's your hand

00:13:55.839 --> 00:14:05.399
find it to do? Do it how? Half-heartedly? No. With all thy might. We think about this

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:09.479
thing. You've heard the term, obviously, we live in the greater DC area, that people will

00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:13.039
use that phraseology, it's good enough for government work. Has anyone ever heard somebody

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:19.440
use that phraseology? It's good enough for government work. Listen, that ought not be

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:28.760
the perspective of God's people. God honors hard work. And we find that as we look here,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.279
remember, you understand that sometimes we have the idea that work is part of the curse.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:40.320
But you know that Adam had a responsibility to work before the curse. There was a responsibility

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.479
that God gave to Adam that was work. Now, you understand the work intensified after

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:52.799
the curse, but there was work. And we begin to think about this subject of work and we

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:57.160
look at the character. Listen, the character of a man is important for us to understand.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.720
And as we begin to enter into the study of the life of Joseph, it's important for us

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.919
to understand the character of Joseph. And we find, as I referenced already there in

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:15.199
Colossians 3 and verse 23, and whatsoever you do, do it heartily as to the Lord and

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:20.839
not unto men. You know, your perspective of work and my perspective of work ought to be

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:28.600
different than our lost co-workers. It ought to be different than our lost co-workers.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.600
The young people in our church, you know what, they need to learn how to work. Honestly,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.959
they didn't learn how to work. It's good for them to move tables around. It's good

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:47.479
for them to, I'll pick just from little Ari, he's tired this afternoon, but man, he was

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:53.160
pulling weeds the other night outside after church. He's just pulling weeds. And I went

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.279
to Pierre and Kimberly, I said, man, he's pulling weeds. He can come back anytime he

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:03.839
wants. We've got a whole lot of weeds. He's pulling weeds. A little Isaac a few weeks

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:07.660
ago, probably actually six or eight weeks ago now, I was out on a Wednesday evening

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.639
before church and just a couple of people were here and the porch had all kinds of stuff

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.720
that had blown on it from the wind and the trees and what have you. And I'm out there

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:25.919
with a broom and I'm sweeping the porch. Isaac is watching me. You know, Isaac's a thinker.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:33.600
He really is. Isaac, how you doing? And there's like this long pause. Good. And I'm like,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.760
that's not like, it's not like most of us. How are you doing? Good. And you just don't

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.040
even think about it. Right. But Isaac and Isaac kind of watching me and then he goes

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.519
away and he goes into the van of the tray hose. He comes back and his little kids broom

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:55.559
and he starts helping me sweep the porch. I didn't ask him to help me. It's good for

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:03.919
kids to learn how to work. It really is. And we see in the truth of God's Word with regard

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:10.160
to work. Listen, the Bible tells us if a man doesn't work, he shouldn't eat. Now I understand

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:19.119
that's not popular today. I understand. But it's biblical. It's biblical. And hard work

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:24.679
we see in the life as we begin to look at the life of Joseph and as we begin an introduction

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:30.199
for this study that will spend and span a number of chapters from God's Word with regard

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:37.079
to the life of Joseph, we see here that he's, he's working. But notice what the Bible says

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:41.679
back in Genesis chapter 37 and verse number two. I want you to notice that the Bible says

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:48.559
this. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:59.720
flock. Did you notice the next three words? With his brethren. He's feeding the flock

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.880
with the very ones that hate him, with the very ones that cannot speak peaceably unto

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:13.839
him. And he's working with them. Now I can only imagine and this is just my perspective.

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:17.919
This is, the Bible doesn't tell us this but it's just my perspective. I would think that

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:22.079
if they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him that they probably tried to give

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:29.279
him the hardest jobs. And give him the tasks that they didn't want to do. By the way, he's

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:37.039
younger. They're older. You think about that dynamic. And I see Joseph here and I think

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:43.080
about the fact that he's working, that he's feeding the flock and he's working right alongside

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:51.919
those that hate him. Just because they hated him doesn't mean he has to hate them. The

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:58.799
Bible tells us in Romans chapter 12, if you want to take a moment to turn there, in Romans

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:09.260
chapter number 12 God gives us some instruction that quite honestly goes against your flesh

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:18.700
and my flesh. But the Bible tells us in Romans chapter number 12, in verse number 17, recompense

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:25.779
to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. Notice verse 18,

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:33.580
if it be possible, as much as life in you, live peaceably with all men. Sometimes that's

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:40.659
a challenging verse of scripture to live out in your life. Joseph was hated by his

00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:46.820
brethren. They could not speak peaceably unto him. But he's working with them. He's working

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.619
with them. Just because they hated him doesn't mean he has to hate them. Dearly beloved,

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:57.859
verse 19, avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance

00:19:57.859 --> 00:20:00.219
is mine. I will repay, saith the Lord.

00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:02.419
Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him.

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:03.739
If he thirst, give him drink.

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:06.579
For in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire in his head.

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:10.699
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

00:20:10.699 --> 00:20:13.779
Listen, that goes against your flesh and my flesh.

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.379
It really does.

00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:17.339
That's trusting God.

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.259
That's taking your walk of faith to a whole nother level.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:25.339
And we find that here, it reminds me of the relationship

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:29.059
or the interaction, if you will, between David and Saul.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.299
Saul wanted to kill David.

00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:35.459
Saul tried to get others to kill him.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:37.379
He tried to get the Philistines to kill him

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:39.259
and tried to get his own men to kill him.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:41.579
And then David is hunted by Saul.

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.379
He goes out, he's seeking him every day.

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:45.099
He's going and doing all that he can.

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:46.419
David says it this way,

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:49.419
there's but a step between me and death.

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:50.979
He understood.

00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:53.579
But just because Saul made David his enemy,

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:56.299
and the Bible says he made him his enemy continually,

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:01.699
doesn't mean that David viewed Saul as an enemy.

00:21:01.699 --> 00:21:06.699
When David had opportunity to kill Saul, he didn't do it.

00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:09.219
He didn't raise his hand against God's anointed.

00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:12.379
And this evening, when I look at the character

00:21:12.379 --> 00:21:15.259
of this man, Joseph, I understand his childhood

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:17.139
and I understand what's going on

00:21:17.139 --> 00:21:20.459
as we begin to piece Scripture together

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.579
and look at what God tells us about the dysfunction

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:25.999
of the family and all that Joseph would have dealt with.

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:28.999
But as I come and I look at the character of Joseph,

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:30.879
I see that he's a man that's hardworking.

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:33.079
I see that he's working even amongst those

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:36.599
that hate him and cannot speak peaceably unto him.

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:38.799
That tells me a lot about a man's character.

00:21:39.979 --> 00:21:42.559
That he's not fleshly minded.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:45.419
Remember we looked at the life there last Sunday night,

00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:48.839
looked at Genesis 36 when we talked about Esau.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:50.219
He's a fleshly minded man.

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:54.959
The Bible tells us the contrast between Jacob and Esau.

00:21:54.959 --> 00:21:59.279
Remember, why was all that was taking place there

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:02.199
even in the womb and the struggle within the womb

00:22:02.199 --> 00:22:05.359
and God answered and said there's two nations

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:06.639
within thy womb.

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:08.559
But we understand that by application

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.239
there were two natures.

00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:13.039
Jacob representing the spirit

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:16.319
and Esau representing the flesh.

00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:18.119
And here in the text of Scripture,

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:21.419
we do not see that Joseph was a man

00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:23.839
that was operating within the flesh.

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:28.439
He was a man that was trusting the Lord.

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:31.999
By the way, if you think about all of the things

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:34.639
that we will study, all of the events that are recorded

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:37.339
in the life of Joseph and many of us are familiar

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:41.319
with his life, the character of Joseph

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:44.239
was not developed when he was in the pit.

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:48.079
The character of Joseph was not developed

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.399
when he was in the prison.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:54.079
The character of Joseph was developed

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.479
when he was just a young man.

00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:02.119
You know, when he was dealing with all

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:04.719
that he was dealing with, what's happening

00:23:04.719 --> 00:23:07.039
is God is revealing to us his character.

00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:12.139
And here we see at the very start of God's introduction

00:23:12.139 --> 00:23:15.399
to this man, Joseph, we see there's a man of character.

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:17.159
I would say this, not only was he hard working,

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:20.079
not only was he a man that was not given to the flesh,

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.879
but I find this, that he was a man

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:24.439
that had a moral compass.

00:23:24.439 --> 00:23:25.279
What do I mean by that?

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:27.639
Well, he was a man that obviously knew

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:31.719
the difference between right and wrong, good and evil.

00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:33.399
The Bible says in verse number two

00:23:33.399 --> 00:23:35.279
that they're there feeding the flock with his brethren

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:37.279
and the lad was with the sons of Bilhon,

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.639
with the sons of Zilpah, so the Bible tells us

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:42.959
which of the sons specifically he was there with

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:45.119
as they were working and it ends in verse number two

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:49.119
by saying this, and Joseph brought unto his father

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:52.639
their evil report.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:57.639
He brought unto their father, Jacob, their evil report.

00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:00.159
Joseph had a moral compass.

00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:02.919
With all that he dealt with and all of the dysfunction

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:05.799
within the family, with all of the turbulent times

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.679
that were there in Paddan Aram with Laban

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:09.919
and all that had taken place,

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:13.719
evidently God had worked in Joseph's life

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:18.039
for him to have an understanding of who God is.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:21.559
And the difference between right and wrong, good and evil.

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:24.199
Listen, when he stood in Potiphar's house

00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:26.079
and Potiphar's wife said continually,

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:29.599
lie with me day by day, it wasn't in that moment

00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:33.599
that all of a sudden Joseph developed this moral compass.

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:36.999
No, early in his life he was able to understand

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:38.959
that there's a God and there's truth

00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:40.599
and there's right and there's wrong,

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:42.599
there's good and there's evil.

00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:46.119
And he said, how then can I do this evil

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.079
in the sight of God?

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:50.979
And that's a powerful statement that Joseph makes.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:54.639
But we find all the way back here in Genesis 37

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:56.879
when we're first introduced to this man Joseph

00:24:56.879 --> 00:25:00.419
that he has a moral compass and begin to meditate

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:03.179
upon this truth that he's bringing to his father,

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:05.239
their evil report, and I'm reminded

00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:07.639
of what happened in Genesis 35.

00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:12.319
Turn back, if you will, to Genesis chapter number 35.

00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:15.519
We studied this portion of scripture several weeks ago,

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.999
but I want you to understand that as you come here

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:22.399
to Genesis chapter 35, the reunion with Esau

00:25:22.399 --> 00:25:25.999
has already taken place and all that's gone on there,

00:25:25.999 --> 00:25:28.359
but we find that the Bible tells us,

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:32.399
remember in chapter 34, we read of that situation

00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:35.839
with the massacre at Shechem and all that took place

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:38.919
and we dealt with that, but you come to chapter 35

00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:41.519
and God says to Jacob in verse number one,

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:45.799
arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there.

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:49.319
And we made note as we studied Genesis chapter number 35

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:51.199
that they were going to Bethel,

00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:53.799
they were going to the house of God.

00:25:56.399 --> 00:26:00.839
And Jacob gave some instruction to his family

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:05.179
when they were preparing to go to the house of God.

00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:07.239
And he says to them in verse number two,

00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:09.039
then Jacob said unto his household

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.559
and to all that were with him,

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:13.519
put away the strange gods that are among you

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:16.879
and be clean and change your garments

00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:19.439
and let us arise and go up to Bethel

00:26:19.439 --> 00:26:21.439
and I will make there an altar unto God

00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:23.599
who answered me in the day of my distress

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:26.519
and was with me in the way which I went.

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:29.779
Jacob had been to Bethel before.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.159
As far as I can tell in my Bible study,

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:35.919
Joseph has not been to Bethel until this time

00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:40.479
in Genesis 35, but Jacob had been at Bethel

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.239
and Jacob had experienced that

00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:46.159
and Jacob knew what God did when he was there in Bethel

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:48.239
and he says to his family, he says,

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:49.959
we're going to go to Bethel

00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:52.719
and we are going to worship God.

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.599
And as I preached through Genesis chapter 35

00:26:56.599 --> 00:26:59.999
several weeks ago, I mentioned how that we must be prepared

00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:00.879
for worship.

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:04.479
He tells them in verse two,

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:06.919
to put away the strange gods that are among you,

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:10.399
to be clean and to change your garments.

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:12.839
I'm not gonna re-preach what I preached a few weeks ago,

00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:16.319
but I believe this evening that as we come to chapter 37

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:20.079
and we're introduced to Joseph as a 17 year old young man,

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:23.519
that their moral compass that was developed in Joseph,

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:26.799
that somehow there was an impact in his life

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.599
from that experience in Genesis 35

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.599
when they went to Bethel, when they went to the house of God.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:35.359
And God did something in Joseph's life.

00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:41.359
Joseph, listen, I understand that the other sons were there

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:44.719
but you understand there are a whole bunch of people

00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:46.319
that heard Jesus preach

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:50.399
and some left doing what Jesus said

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:53.219
and others left not doing what Jesus said.

00:27:54.199 --> 00:27:58.359
It wasn't in the message or the messenger,

00:27:58.359 --> 00:27:59.599
it was in the individual.

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:03.079
We find that Jesus said,

00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:05.939
those that hear and do are like the wise man.

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:12.319
Those that hear and do not are like the foolish man.

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:14.399
We sing the song with the children,

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:16.719
the wise man built his house upon the rocks.

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:23.379
We find that here, that though the other sons,

00:28:23.379 --> 00:28:25.159
they went to Bethel as well,

00:28:25.159 --> 00:28:30.159
I believe that Joseph had an encounter with God

00:28:30.199 --> 00:28:32.659
that had an impact in his life,

00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:35.539
that helped him have this moral compass.

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:39.279
You understand this evening that there is right and wrong.

00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:41.879
There is good and evil.

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:45.619
Our theme for Vacation Bible School

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:47.699
will be dealing with this truth

00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:49.179
of being keepers of the kingdom

00:28:49.179 --> 00:28:51.879
and dealing with the fact that there are two kingdoms

00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:52.719
in this world.

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:57.039
There's a kingdom for good and there's a kingdom for evil.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:02.799
Good master is what one said to Jesus.

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:10.019
And Jesus said, why calleth me good?

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:14.399
Who defines good?

00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:18.000
God, because only God is good.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:22.679
And when God tells us in his word to do good,

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:27.319
we have to go to the Bible and find out what that is,

00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:28.379
what pleases him.

00:29:29.199 --> 00:29:33.399
And we find that Joseph having this moral compass,

00:29:33.399 --> 00:29:35.839
being 17 years old, the Bible says that he brought

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:39.839
unto his father their evil report.

00:29:39.839 --> 00:29:41.759
You're in a situation where you knew

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:42.839
you had to do something right,

00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:44.399
but it was gonna be hard to do.

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:48.000
Some people would look at verse number two

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.299
and say that Joseph was a tattletale.

00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:55.739
He's running back and I don't look at it that way.

00:29:57.699 --> 00:29:59.299
He had a moral compass.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.899
And so what those boys are doing.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:08.919
is not right. And it had to have been so egregious that Joseph understood that

00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:17.479
Jacob had to be aware of this. And Joseph had courage to bring that evil report

00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:23.639
back to his father. I don't think it would be easy. I really don't. I think

00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:28.279
that understanding the childhood and the upbringing, the family

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:31.819
dynamic, and understand the Bible says they hated him and they could not speak

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:35.659
peaceably unto him. Obviously in just a little while we'll find how they take

00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:38.539
him and they're gonna conspire to kill him. And then they say, well, no, let's

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:42.139
just sell him because we can get some money for him, and so on and so forth. But

00:30:42.139 --> 00:30:46.259
we find here that when Joseph brought unto his father their evil report,

00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:55.659
this took a measure of courage. He didn't just turn a blind eye. I understand this

00:30:55.659 --> 00:31:04.059
evening that it's not popular, it's not comfortable to confront someone about

00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:09.819
their wicked behavior, to deal with something. But I would submit to you this

00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:15.019
evening that there is right and there is wrong. There's good and there's evil.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:18.979
There are times in our lives where God will put us in a place where we have to

00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:26.059
have that moral compass and we have to be willing to have that measure of

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:33.019
courage to be able to stand and say, no, that's just not right. That's just not

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:40.219
right. He had this moral compass and therefore he stood for right. He stood

00:31:40.219 --> 00:31:46.859
for right. I think about Nathan. I already mentioned about David and Saul. But think

00:31:46.899 --> 00:31:58.619
about Nathan. God supernaturally revealed to Nathan the sin of David and then

00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:06.259
instructed him to confront David. By the way, it's no easy task to go stand before

00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:16.899
a king and to say, thou art the man. But it was necessary. It was needful. And I think

00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:22.819
about Joseph here in Genesis chapter 37. And I think about Joseph and I think about

00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:27.659
his character and how he brought unto his father their evil report. And as I look at

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:31.099
that statement and I see what's happening, yes, the moral compass, but the standing

00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:41.899
for right. Look over to Ephesians chapter 6, if you will. Ephesians chapter number 6.

00:32:41.899 --> 00:32:46.459
As we look at Ephesians 6, we're familiar with the passage of scripture. As we think

00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:53.659
about the character of Joseph and the need for us this evening to stand, we sing, stand

00:32:53.659 --> 00:33:06.459
up, stand up, stand up for Jesus. God says through Paul to the believers of Ephesus,

00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:12.699
finally in verse number 10 of Ephesians 6, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:21.299
power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, why? That you may be able to stand

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:29.459
against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,

00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:32.419
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:39.579
wickedness in high places. Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that you

00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:48.219
may be able to withstand in the evil day, having done all to stand. Stand therefore,

00:33:48.219 --> 00:33:54.859
having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness,

00:33:54.859 --> 00:34:00.019
your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield

00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:04.539
of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take

00:34:04.539 --> 00:34:10.859
the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. As you read

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:14.819
these few verses of scripture, verse 18 says, praying always with all prayer and supplication

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:18.779
of the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all

00:34:18.779 --> 00:34:23.219
saints. But as you read through this portion of scripture, you'll see stand or withstand

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:29.139
mentioned several times. We're living in a time where we need some of God's people to

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:37.139
have the kind of character that Joseph had. As a 17 year old boy, to stand up for truth,

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:43.499
to stand up for right, what you're doing is wrong. It's evil. It's ungodly. Again, it

00:34:43.499 --> 00:34:49.619
must have been egregious for Joseph to have that understanding that he had to bring this

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:59.579
evil report to his father Jacob. No doubt this would only add to the dysfunction of

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:06.019
the family, to the hatred of the brethren towards Joseph. But Jesus said this, if the

00:35:06.019 --> 00:35:13.499
world hates you, just remember that they hated me first. If you read through the Gospel

00:35:13.499 --> 00:35:18.019
of John, you find that God is preparing His servants. Look over, if you will, at John

00:35:18.019 --> 00:35:25.459
15, and notice what the Bible says as you begin to look through this portion of scripture

00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:33.539
and begin to understand as the Lord Jesus Christ is trying to prepare His children for

00:35:33.539 --> 00:35:44.379
their service to Him. Listen, if the world loves us, there's probably something wrong.

00:35:44.379 --> 00:35:55.899
Honestly. Look at John 15 and verse 18. If the world hates you, you know that it hated

00:35:55.899 --> 00:36:03.259
me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own. But are

00:36:03.259 --> 00:36:06.619
we to be of the world? The Bible says love not the world, neither the things that are

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:10.899
in the world. The Bible tells us that if we love the world, that the love of the Father

00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:18.079
is not in us. You read the book of James, it's pretty strong language that if we're

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:25.299
friends with the world, that we're enemies of God. That's pretty strong language. Here

00:36:25.299 --> 00:36:29.979
he says in verse 19, if ye were of the world, the world would love his own. But because

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:34.139
you're not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:38.739
hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, the servant is not greater than

00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:42.859
his Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept

00:36:42.859 --> 00:36:47.419
my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for

00:36:47.419 --> 00:36:53.019
my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. We could read through the end

00:36:53.019 --> 00:36:56.899
of the chapter, we could read into the beginning of chapter 16, and we could read all of that

00:36:56.899 --> 00:37:02.899
text and see how the Lord is preparing his servants, but we find here this evening that

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:07.299
listen, when we stand for truth and we stand for right, when we have that moral compass

00:37:07.299 --> 00:37:12.859
that is the result of the biblical truth that God has given us, it's not going to make us

00:37:12.859 --> 00:37:25.259
popular with the world. But I'd rather be right with God than popular with the world.

00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:31.819
And this evening, listen we're dealing with some things in our world today. We're dealing

00:37:31.819 --> 00:37:37.339
with some crazy things in our world today. There's right and wrong. There's good and

00:37:37.339 --> 00:37:44.419
evil. When I begin to look at the life of Joseph and all the things that we're studying,

00:37:44.419 --> 00:37:49.299
all the events that God gives us, I see in just these first few verses of introduction

00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:56.779
that Joseph was a man of character. At 17 years old, he had character. He stood for

00:37:56.779 --> 00:38:06.979
what was right. Listen, he could have, as some have developed today in our society,

00:38:06.979 --> 00:38:15.819
developed some kind of a victim mentality. Excused his not serving the Lord because of

00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:21.019
his upbringing and all the things that he had to deal with. And I was hated of my brethren

00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:27.739
and I was this and I was that and so on and so forth. But Joseph, he wasn't going to let

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:36.219
his past define him. He was going to serve God. He was a man that did not have the whole

00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:42.859
Bible as we do, but so many biblical truths that God has given us, we can go back to the

00:38:42.859 --> 00:38:47.659
life of Joseph and see them in his life. He was a man that set his affection on things

00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:55.979
above. He was a man that saw and knew the presence of God. He was a man that sought

00:38:55.979 --> 00:39:03.219
to please the Lord. This evening, we see his childhood. We learn some things about what

00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:11.179
he dealt with, but I see his character. Character is important in a man. Character is important.

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:20.139
Hard working. Not given place to the flesh. Having a moral compass and standing for what

00:39:20.139 --> 00:39:27.019
is right. This evening, I hope that God would help us to have the kind of character in our

00:39:27.019 --> 00:39:32.659
lives that Joseph had in his life. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you

00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:38.859
for loving us. We thank you for the introduction of the life of Joseph and as we look at these

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:51.979
few verses of Scripture, God, I pray that you'd help us to be individuals of character.

00:39:51.979 --> 00:39:57.779
God that we would allow your word to have an impact and influence in our lives. We'd

00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.899
have an encounter with you that we would daily enter into.

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:08.039
your presence. God, I pray that even as we have the entirety of your word, we have the

00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:14.179
instruction there in Ephesians 6 with putting on the whole armor of God, you'd help us

00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:19.519
to stand, to stand for truth, to stand for right, to stand against the wiles of the devil,

00:40:19.519 --> 00:40:31.959
the enemy. Lord, in this society in which we're living, where evil is called good, good

00:40:31.959 --> 00:40:47.359
is called evil, wickedness is celebrated. Wickedness is not just allowed or tolerated,

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:58.719
it is celebrated. God, I pray that you'd help us to stand for truth. Help us, God, to be

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:13.359
beacons and lights. Help us to remember that the light shines. God, help us to remember

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:19.319
that if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. I pray, God, that you'd give

00:41:19.319 --> 00:41:27.859
us this kind of character. Bless now as we have an opportunity for responding, a time

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:34.159
of invitation. Lord, I pray that you'd have your will and way, work in hearts and lives.

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:37.479
I pray that you'd be glorified through every decision. For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:38.879
Would you stand with me, heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
