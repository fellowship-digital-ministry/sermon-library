1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
number 25 this evening, Genesis chapter number 25, and we'll look at verses 27 down through

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,479
verse number 34. In the preceding text that we studied a couple of weeks ago on Sunday evening,

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:20,879
Genesis 25, verses 19 through 26, we had the opportunity to read in that portion of Scripture

4
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,079
about the birth of Esau and Jacob. And of course, as we looked at that portion of Scripture,

5
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:33,520
we noted, of course, the supplication. We noted that Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife. Why?

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Because she was barren. But then we also learned how that Rebecca sought the face of God. Why?

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,560
Because there was this struggle within her. And so we spoke about the supplication, we spoke of

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,639
the struggle, and then we looked at some symbolism in that preceding text. As we move forward into

9
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:55,840
the text of Scripture this evening in this chapter, we find the Bible simply says in verse

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,479
number 27, and the boys grew. And now all of a sudden, we're looking at an event that takes

11
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,559
place much later in life. In verses 20, really 19 through 26, we have the opportunity of hearing of

12
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:12,480
their birth. The Bible tells us in verse number 26, and after that, speaking of Esau, now Jacob

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,519
being born, and after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel.

14
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,239
And his name was called Jacob, and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them.

15
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,160
And then the Bible tells us that the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field,

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,279
and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents. It says in verse number 32, look at verse 33 with me,

17
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:39,279
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. And he swear unto him, and he sold his birthright

18
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:44,239
unto Jacob. And so the title for the message, as you see in the bulletin this evening,

19
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,720
is Esau sold his birthright to Jacob. When we mention the symbolism that was noted as it's

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,400
given to us in verse number 23, we really spoke of two things. One was this, there are two nations,

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,720
and we understood the contextual application here of the interpretation that there are two nations

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,399
within thy womb. That was when she, Rebekah, had sought the Lord with regard to the struggle that

23
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,479
was within her. And God says, there are two nations that are within thy womb in verse number

24
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,600
23. And we understand that Jacob becomes Israel, the nation of the people of God, the Israelites.

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,559
And then Esau, he becomes Edom, or as we often see in the Word of God, the Edomites. And you find

26
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:33,600
that throughout the scriptures, especially in the Old Testament in particular, you see that there's

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,360
great conflict regularly that you read of between the children of Israel, the descendants of Jacob,

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,880
and the Edomites, the descendants of Esau. And you see regularly these representations and these

29
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:55,839
disagreements and these battles between these two groups of people. But we said that not only

30
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:01,759
was it that there were two nations—remember, God continues and says, two men are people—shall

31
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,759
be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall be stronger than the other people,

32
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:14,320
and the elder shall serve the younger. And we see that God is giving insight with regard to His plan.

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,919
We looked at Romans 9 and discussed some of that in our last message. But we also noted that the

34
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,199
application of this passage of scripture, or one application that we could look at, is not only

35
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,600
the two nations, but there are two natures. And we dealt with this not only looking at Esau and

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Jacob, but we also looked at this several months ago when we looked at the distinction between

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,080
Ishmael and Isaac. And remember, Ishmael, after the birth of Isaac, that Ishmael and Hagar were

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,800
cast out. Remember, God told Abraham to, yes, take heed to what Sarah said and cast them out.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,320
And so we find that in like manner, as you see with Ishmael and Isaac, you find here with Esau

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,679
and Jacob that there's these two natures, and we made the application of the old man versus the new

41
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:07,839
man, the desires of the flesh versus the fruit of the Spirit, the work of the flesh versus the

42
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:13,440
fruit of the Spirit. And we understand the struggle that we deal with. We understand that after

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,519
salvation, that the new man has the desires that God gives, but we still have this flesh. It is not

44
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,320
eradicated. We are to crucify our flesh. We are to mortify our flesh. But the reality is that that is

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,320
a day-by-day decision that we make as we walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,679
the flesh. And as we look at that really by backdrop, we fast forward to the text of scripture

47
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:45,119
that is before us now, and we see that the Bible tells us that the boys grew in verse number 27.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,359
And Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. We

49
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:59,119
see if you're taking notes this evening, a distinct difference is noted. In one single verse of

50
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:06,640
scripture, God gives us here in verse number 27 this distinct difference between Esau and Jacob.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,440
We've already noted that the Bible tells us of the two nations. We've made the application with

52
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,279
regard to the two natures. But even in their physical lives, you see that there is a great

53
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:25,359
contrast between these two brothers, these twins. The Bible tells us that Esau is a cunning hunter,

54
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:31,600
a man of the field. And yet we find the Bible says of Jacob that he is a plain man, dwelling

55
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,000
in tents. The reality is that the differences in which we find not only here within this text of

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,119
scripture with these two men, these brothers, but even differences that we have within our own

57
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,760
families and within differences that people have one with another, the differences are to be

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:56,160
expected. But we really find that through looking at some of this, even what's noted in verse number

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,040
27 and definitely in the following verses of scripture, that you really see the outworking

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,640
of what we discussed in our previous message with regard to the two nations and the two natures.

61
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:14,160
And really the desire for carnal or fleshly things, the immediate, if you will, versus the

62
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,559
desire for the eternal things, those things which are spiritual. And so we know that these differences

63
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:25,519
are here. Yes, they were different in appearance. We see that the Bible tells us in verse number 25,

64
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,079
the first, speaking of Esau, came out red all over like an hairy garment,

65
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,760
and they called his name Esau. And no doubt there was a distinct difference even in their

66
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,880
appearance, as we note in verse 25 and 26 between Esau and Jacob. But we also note that there's a

67
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,959
distinct difference in their pursuits and the pursuits that are mentioned here in verse 27.

68
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,399
We don't know how much time has passed. We don't know, even as we mentioned in our previous message

69
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,959
and as we've gone through these couple of chapters, that not all of these events are in

70
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,559
strict chronological order here in these chapters of the book of Genesis. For we looked at the

71
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:10,239
burial of Abraham at the beginning of chapter number 25, but even at that time, we find that

72
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:15,920
Jacob and Esau would have been 15 years old, and yet their birth is not dealt with until later in

73
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,040
the passage of scripture. And so it's not in strict chronological order, but we are not certain as to

74
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,440
how much time has passed between their birth and now this particular time. It does seem, as you look

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,279
at the text of scripture, that Isaac and Rebekah are not fully aware of everything that's going to

76
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:40,320
transpire in this particular text, perhaps not being there at the time. That's really not completely

77
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,040
necessary to the text of scripture, but though it's worth pointing out with regard to what

78
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:50,799
happens in chapter 27, and we'll look at that in a few weeks. Let me say this, as we note the

79
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:55,600
distinct difference, I want you to note in the next verse of scripture, it seems as if there's

80
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,200
a dysfunctional family. I mentioned this morning in the message, I mentioned about sibling rivalry,

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,359
and I mentioned about preaching on Esau and Jacob this evening, and I did make the statement

82
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:10,480
about a dysfunctional family. And I think when you look at this particular verse of scripture

83
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,040
and then see the outworking of what we find in verse number 28, and you look at the fullness of

84
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,000
that as it's revealed in Genesis chapter 27, you'll see that there's a dysfunctional family

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,440
here. The Bible says in Isaac, that's dad of course, Isaac loved Esau. Why? Because he did

86
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:39,280
eat of his venison. And the Bible says, but Rebekah loved Jacob. And so there's some

87
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,960
dysfunction here, it would seem. It's not, we don't get a bunch of detail. He doesn't go into it.

88
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,479
God doesn't provide all of these details, but we find what we read here in verse number 28 is very

89
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:55,840
insightful when you start looking at what happens in chapter 27. I don't want to get too far ahead

90
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,559
of myself in our study of the book of Genesis, but you'll know that in chapter number 27,

91
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,840
it was when Isaac called Esau, and he told Esau he was going to give him a blessing. Remember,

92
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,320
go out and get that venison, prepare it, the kind that I love, and I'll give you a blessing. And

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,679
Rebekah overhears that, and Rebekah schemes and has a meal prepared and sends Jacob in, and

94
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,479
Jacob's concerned because, you know, dad's going to know that it's not me, and so on and so forth.

95
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:29,440
And really, you see the statement here in Genesis 25 and verse number 28 that leads us to really

96
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,479
seeing the outworking of this dysfunction in chapter number 27. Now, the thing that's interesting

97
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:41,119
to me that we'll make quick note of here in this verse of Scripture is that it's very sad to me

98
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:46,960
that even as you would see the dysfunction within the family here, we continue to this day to see

99
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,159
dysfunctional families. We continue to this day to find that there are families that have been given

100
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:59,919
the truth with regard to what God's plan is, and yet there are times in which

101
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,379
God's plan is rejected.

102
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:07,119
God had made it clear to Rebecca as she prayed

103
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,199
and sought the Lord and inquired of the Lord

104
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,839
with regard to the struggle,

105
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,759
that the elder shall serve the younger, right?

106
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,039
That's what God told her.

107
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,319
And in chapter number 27, we find that really,

108
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:22,799
there's a point, a purpose really of Isaac

109
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,639
to give the blessing to Esau.

110
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,799
And we find that God's plan had already been revealed

111
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,759
to them back in chapter 25,

112
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,599
and this dysfunction begins to reveal itself

113
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,519
in all sorts of manners.

114
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
And you find that what happens is after the Esau

115
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,559
returns in chapter 27,

116
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,399
he's pretty happy with Jacob, isn't he?

117
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,719
No, he's ready to kill him, right?

118
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,519
So what does Isaac have to do?

119
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,039
What does Rebecca say?

120
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,079
I'm gonna send you away.

121
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,719
Go away for a little while.

122
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,719
A little while turned into years and years

123
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,319
and years.

124
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,959
Go away for a little while, why?

125
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,159
Because your brother's anger will soon pass

126
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,799
after the grieving of your father.

127
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,519
And we find this dysfunction,

128
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,279
and when we begin to go down the path

129
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,519
of not following the plan that God has revealed,

130
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,839
we see that there are bad consequences to that.

131
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,119
And in our society today,

132
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,359
we've mentioned many times over the years

133
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,039
that the family is under attack.

134
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,199
Why is it that the enemy wants to attack the family?

135
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,879
You have to have a strong family.

136
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,159
When you do not have strong families,

137
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,119
you're not gonna have a strong society.

138
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,479
From a spiritual aspect,

139
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:43,079
when you think about the strength of families,

140
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,279
it is imperative to have strong families

141
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,919
in order to have a strong church.

142
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,919
Strong churches are made up of strong families.

143
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,919
It's just the way it is.

144
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,959
And we see the dysfunction here in Genesis chapter 25

145
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,959
within the home of Isaac and Rebekah

146
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,799
where Isaac loves Esau.

147
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,639
Why?

148
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,879
Because of the venison that he ate,

149
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,399
but Rebekah loved Jacob.

150
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,959
And there's this, you know,

151
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,439
as the scriptures unfold this to me,

152
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:12,519
no doubt in my mind that there was known tension

153
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,439
in the home.

154
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,839
No doubt in my mind this was known by the children.

155
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,439
I know that there are times,

156
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,359
I remember even with my brother,

157
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,599
still to this day we'll joke about who's the favorite

158
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,079
and we all know, I'll say publicly,

159
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,559
we all know that my brother is the favorite.

160
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,559
But the reality is that we just play with that, right?

161
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,839
But can you imagine if you're really living

162
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
in a situation where you're dealing

163
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,119
with this level of dysfunction?

164
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,399
It's challenging, difficult.

165
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,279
And we find that this is the verse of scripture

166
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,439
that gives us kind of a setting and a background

167
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,479
for the family that we're dealing with.

168
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:56,279
And we see this, again, still being a problem today

169
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,239
with this dysfunctional family.

170
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,199
The bulk of the text this evening deals

171
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,439
with our final point, and it's only 625,

172
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,079
but just, it's okay.

173
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,039
We'll be at this final point for a while.

174
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,119
And it's a despised birthright.

175
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,279
A despised birthright.

176
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,119
You understand that the birthright was valuable.

177
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,959
We find that in biblical times

178
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,639
and even in many cultures today

179
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,039
around the face of the planet,

180
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,439
that this is quite significant

181
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:24,359
when you speak about the birthright, the firstborn.

182
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,479
It continues to be a very significant thing.

183
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:29,519
There are plenty of nations around the globe today

184
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,559
that have cultures that are still very much focused

185
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,959
upon birthrights and firstborn and birth order

186
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,519
and so on and so forth and the significance of that.

187
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
And we really see it scripturally.

188
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,399
We understand that scripturally,

189
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,119
there's many references that are made

190
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:47,519
with regard to the firstborn and the birthright

191
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,359
and what have you.

192
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,919
And so it's quite significant.

193
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:53,999
And the birthright is absolutely a valuable thing.

194
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,559
And we find that God, just as he has,

195
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,719
and he will in other instances,

196
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,679
he's given the truth in verse number 23

197
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,039
as he spoke to Rebekah in answering her inquiry

198
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,839
with regard to the struggle,

199
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,479
that the one people shall be stronger than the other people

200
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:13,119
and the elder shall serve the younger.

201
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,199
And we find that when you think about the birthright

202
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,039
in the firstborn, that this would be opposite

203
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,439
of how the normal outworking would be,

204
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,639
but this is what God's plan was.

205
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
When we think about the birthright,

206
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,679
and we think about the significance of the birthright,

207
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,399
it's interesting if you would be mindful

208
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,079
of just a couple of other times in the scriptures.

209
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,079
I'll just reference a couple this evening

210
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,399
as with regard to the significance.

211
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,479
Look over in Genesis chapter 43.

212
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,399
In Genesis chapter 43, just to give you the quick background

213
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,159
of what's going on, Joseph, of course,

214
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,919
has been there in Egypt.

215
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,799
And we find that as he's there in Egypt

216
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,319
that he's, of course, in control

217
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,759
and he's got so much power

218
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,599
because of the interpretation of Pharaoh's dream

219
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,879
and all that's taken place.

220
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,879
And the plague, the famine, not only affected Egypt,

221
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,479
but it affected everywhere.

222
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,279
And we find that there was no food in Canaan.

223
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,659
And so what happened, Jacob sent the boys to Egypt.

224
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,339
And after the first visit there,

225
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,059
we find that it was made clear

226
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,619
that unless the youngest came,

227
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:26,179
they would not see his face, right?

228
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,059
So Jacob is bothered by that.

229
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:28,899
Why?

230
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,739
Because he believes that Joseph is already dead

231
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:33,859
and now mischief is going to fall upon Benjamin.

232
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,539
And this is just a terrible situation.

233
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,019
And we understand we won't go through all of it,

234
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,259
but we come to the point

235
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,419
where all of the brothers are now there.

236
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,519
And the Bible tells us that here in this text of scripture

237
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,139
that he, Joseph, he's not yet made himself known.

238
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,659
He doesn't do that until chapter 45.

239
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,339
But at the end of chapter number 43,

240
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,019
he tells them all that they're going to have a meal

241
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,559
and they all gather together.

242
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,339
And notice what it says in verse 33.

243
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,779
This is of interest just to see the reference

244
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,859
that is made to the birth order

245
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,759
and to the significance of the firstborn.

246
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,299
It says, and they sat before him, the firstborn,

247
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,859
according to his birthright,

248
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,579
and the youngest, according to his youth.

249
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,539
Notice what it says, and the men marveled one at another.

250
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,579
And we understand, of course,

251
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,659
that there's some indication within that

252
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,259
where they're wondering how in the world

253
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,839
did he know what our birth order was

254
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,379
and so on and so forth.

255
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,219
But it's certainly interesting

256
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,779
how this would have been customary

257
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,619
when you think about the birth order

258
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,299
and just the process and the birthright.

259
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,699
We find that in Deuteronomy chapter 21,

260
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,899
turn over there, and I want you to note

261
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,539
what happens in Deuteronomy 21

262
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,459
as God is giving instruction to the people of God

263
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,219
as they would be preparing to enter

264
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,539
into the land of promise.

265
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,659
And of course, really kind of a review of the law

266
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,819
that's been given and all of the requirements

267
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,059
and what have you.

268
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,539
Notice in Deuteronomy 21 in verse number 17,

269
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,099
the Bible says this.

270
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,019
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated

271
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:12,299
for the firstborn by giving him a double portion

272
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,979
of all that he hath.

273
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,099
For he is the beginning of his strength,

274
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,299
the right of the firstborn is his.

275
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,739
Now, what's being discussed in the previous verses

276
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,299
of Scripture is if a man has more than one wife

277
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,139
and he has one wife that's beloved

278
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:28,699
and another wife that isn't,

279
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:32,459
that he could not choose who he would bestow

280
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:37,259
the blessing of the firstborn based upon the mother.

281
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,139
It had to be by the birth order,

282
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,779
the birthright that was given.

283
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:46,259
And it says this at the end of verse number 17,

284
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:48,779
by giving him a double portion of all that he hath,

285
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,119
for he is the beginning of his strength,

286
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,259
notice the right of the firstborn is his.

287
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,539
So birthright in the firstborn,

288
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,699
it's significant, it's valuable.

289
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:01,379
We do find that the blessing that was attached

290
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,179
or associated with the firstborn,

291
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,219
with the birthright could be lost.

292
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,579
You remember that is, and we won't turn there

293
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:10,659
and deal with it, but in Genesis chapter 48 and 49,

294
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,019
when Jacob is ready to die and he's going

295
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,779
to bestow his blessings upon his family,

296
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,859
the blessing that would be for Reuben,

297
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,339
who was the firstborn, was actually not given to Reuben,

298
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,219
but it was given to Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.

299
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,059
Why?

300
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,779
Because of the sin of Reuben, right?

301
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,179
And so because of the sin of Reuben,

302
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,179
he had really forfeited, he lost the blessing

303
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,739
that was attached to that firstborn, to that birthright,

304
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,820
because of his sinful behavior.

305
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,320
In fact, in Genesis chapter number 49,

306
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,760
when Jacob begins to address him,

307
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,779
because he is the firstborn,

308
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,919
he says that he's the beginning of my strength,

309
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,099
but he says that he's unstable as water,

310
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,700
thou shalt not excel, why?

311
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,299
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,

312
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,059
then defilest thou it, he went up to my couch,

313
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,179
and because of his sin, then we find that that was,

314
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,179
the blessing was lost as a result of that

315
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,479
that was associated with the firstborn, that birthright.

316
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
It also seems, as we look at the passage here,

317
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,739
and by the way, First Chronicles deals with that as well,

318
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,419
as you look at the chronological events

319
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,419
that are going on with Reuben,

320
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:26,299
and that blessing being given to Ephraim and Manasseh,

321
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,419
the sons of Joseph, you can look at First Chronicles

322
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,419
chapter five, and see that there as well.

323
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,979
But it seems evident,

324
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:35,979
through looking at this passage of scripture,

325
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,219
that the birthright also could be used

326
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,779
as something that you could trade

327
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,179
because of the value of it.

328
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,739
I don't think that Jacob just thought this up,

329
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:48,219
and just kind of, on the occasion that is before us,

330
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,039
was like, you know what,

331
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,339
I think maybe I'll take your birthright.

332
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,459
This was something that evidently was practiced,

333
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,979
or at least known to be practiced,

334
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,579
and we find that it's understood.

335
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:07,859
Understanding what's taking place in the value of a birthright that we're told in this text of Scripture that Esau sold his birthright

336
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:15,299
He sold it to Jacob the scriptures tell us that Esau at the end of the chapter in verse number 34 that he despised

337
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,419
his birthright

338
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,739
The word despised means to disdain to abhor

339
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,799
to have the lowest opinion of

340
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,059
Now, can you imagine?

341
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:32,219
When you understand the significance and the value of this birthright and what we've just kind of discussed briefly

342
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:38,039
With regard to the birthright and the firstborn for for Jacob, excuse me for Esau to have

343
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:42,519
It said of him that he despised his birthright

344
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,579
It's very insightful as to the character of this man

345
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:54,339
That we've mentioned in previous messages as we look at this passage notice with me in verse number 29 and we get the setting of

346
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:59,979
What's taking place the Bible told us that that Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field

347
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:05,659
But Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and in verse number 29. It says that Jacob sod pottage

348
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,619
He's at home. He's he's at the the home front. He's made this meal

349
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,579
He's got this thick soup of red lentils that evidently as it continues

350
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:21,499
You kind of see that that's what is mentioned with the color of it and so on and so forth and we find that this

351
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:28,059
Pottage he's made this meal and the Bible says that Esau came from the field and he was faint

352
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:34,539
And so Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and he's out there hunting and he's not able to take any game

353
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:41,339
He's exhausted after this hunt and no doubt as this would be his

354
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,659
manner of receiving some type of sustenance for his

355
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,419
welfare and for his

356
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,419
food that he is

357
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,019
Persistent on trying to find something

358
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:00,099
That he can take and yet the Bible tells us that he came from the field and it seems quite evident that he had no

359
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:06,619
Spoil, he brought back nothing and the Bible says that he was faint. He was faint. I've never hunted. I

360
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:12,539
Don't know that I ever have a desire to hunt most of the people that I speak to about hunting love it

361
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,479
and then you hear those stories about people that sit in the

362
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:23,559
Tree stand or sitting somewhere else and it's 15 degrees and it's snowing and it's this and it's that and they didn't see anything all

363
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,639
Day long and I just don't understand what is so appealing about that

364
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,519
It's just me and I know some of you like to hunt my brother-in-law's try to get me to go hunting with them many times

365
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,919
And I'm like, I'm just not interested in that. I have a house. I have warmth

366
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,159
I have food that I can go and get that somebody else's already

367
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:44,359
Butchered for me. I'm liking that and

368
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,199
The reality is that it is

369
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:54,959
After you go out and you think about this situation with Esau, it's a tiring process

370
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,519
It's a lot of work and if he's out there and he's looking to get something

371
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,359
It's almost it's it's interesting because in chapter 26 it talks about there being a famine in the land

372
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,399
And again, we don't know about the exactness of the chronological events here and how they're laid out

373
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:15,239
But we find that when he comes back in this exhausting hunt

374
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,359
However long that he was out and however long this process was and he finally comes back and he's faint

375
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,359
he's faint and

376
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:32,279
He needs some level of sustenance and the Bible says that Esau speaks to Jacob in verse number 30 and said feed

377
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,799
Me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint

378
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:40,639
Therefore was his name called Edom

379
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,159
We've already mentioned that in verse number 25

380
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,159
It talks about how he came out red

381
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,279
and that he's the the father of excuse me called his name Esau and then here he mentions the red pottage again and

382
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:57,199
Therefore his name was called Edom the the word Edom means red

383
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:02,839
And so there's some level of indication there between both of these things, but notice what is said in verse 31

384
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,159
Notice what Jacob says?

385
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:08,439
Sell me this day

386
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,519
thy birthright

387
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:16,999
Now I don't pretend to understand all of the dysfunction within the family and I don't pretend to understand everything

388
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:23,159
That these boys have dealt with because we don't know the scriptures are don't give us all the details

389
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,759
It simply tells us that they the boys grew and tells us that now there's this event

390
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,839
And so I don't know of all of the sibling rivalry

391
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,239
I don't know of all of the things that had taken place

392
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:37,199
But I do know that when Esau is at his

393
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,719
Wits end so to speak because that's really where we see him and as he gives his description as we go through the text

394
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:47,119
He's at this wits end after being out hunting an unsuccessful

395
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:53,879
Hunt he comes back empty-handed and he's faint and he says give me some of that red pottage

396
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:57,839
I am faint and Jacob says sell me this day thy birthright

397
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,479
Sell me this day thy birthright

398
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,079
notice what Esau says in verse 32

399
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
behold I

400
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:09,199
am at the point to die and

401
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:14,199
What profit shall this birthright do to me?

402
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,919
When I mentioned a moment ago that it's as if he's at wits end

403
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,919
And he says here that I'm at the point to die. It helps us understand the gravity of the situation

404
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,559
It helps us to understand

405
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,559
the length perhaps of the hunt that he was on and how long he was out in the field and how long he was

406
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:35,639
pursuing after some type of

407
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,259
Catch that he could have so that he could feed in

408
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,719
Enjoy that sustenance and we find that he says I'm at the point to die

409
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:52,959
There are times in our lives if I could make a simple application from this verse of Scripture that we are at a place

410
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,759
Where the psalmist refers to it as being at wits end

411
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,479
That we're not in a good state to make decisions

412
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,479
Right

413
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,879
We're at the the place of of not thinking properly of not having the biblical influence that we need to have of

414
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,879
Perhaps just leaning on

415
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:20,239
the the carnal the flesh and obviously we see that in Esau and that's the some symbolism that we see in his life and

416
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:27,239
No doubt even in this particular situation. He needs something now and he's concerned about the immediate

417
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,279
The

418
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,279
Bible says and Jacob said in verse 33

419
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,039
swear to me this day and he swear unto him and

420
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,059
He sold his birthright

421
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,559
unto Jacob I

422
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:47,679
Mentioned that it seems evident as you look at the passage of Scripture that this

423
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,119
Trading or selling of a birthright was something that could be done

424
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,839
I'm not sure at how often it was practiced or how popular the practice was but no doubt

425
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,759
There's an agreement that is made the the inquiry sell me this day thy birthright and Jacob then says

426
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:12,279
To Esau after Esau says what profit does this birthright have to me Jacob says I want you to swear to it

427
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,879
Swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob and then the Bible says then

428
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,839
Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink

429
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,879
Rose up and went his way

430
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,119
thus Esau

431
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,199
despised his birthright

432
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:40,439
the significance of this account that is given to us again with not a ton of detail that's provided is

433
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:46,799
Seen in upcoming passages of Scripture that we'll study and we understand the significance of this

434
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,039
Particular event and as we look at this in future lessons and messages, we'll be able to reference back

435
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:00,559
but we find that the Bible says that that Jacob then gives Esau this food and he ate and he drank and

436
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,559
Then he rose up and went his way

437
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
Despised his birthright notice keep your hand here in Genesis 26

438
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:15,039
But notice what the scriptures tell us in the book of Hebrews in the 12th chapter how this man Esau is described

439
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:21,639
in Hebrews chapter number 12 in verse number 16, the Bible gives us a description of

440
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,679
This man Esau. It's not a very good description

441
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,079
Again as we interpret Scripture with Scripture and compare Scripture with Scripture we get we gather

442
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,479
Additional insight and notice what God says in Hebrews 12 in verse number 16

443
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:43,719
Lest there be any fornicator notice or profane person as Esau

444
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,039
Who for one morsel of meat sold?

445
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:53,919
His birthright two things that I would take away from this particular statement that is given to us in verse number 16 is

446
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,079
the way in which the scriptures

447
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,479
authenticate the record of Genesis

448
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:04,239
So many people think that the the scriptures are so independent one of another

449
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,079
But the reality is that when you study the New Testament, it's really exciting to see how the New Testament

450
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,079
Authenticates the Old Testament in the accounts that you read of as their reference back to

451
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,759
Help see that authentication

452
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:25,919
But we also see that the Bible refers to Esau as being this profane person. It really just simply means this ungodly

453
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,399
ungodly

454
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,719
and and when you think about the the

455
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,399
Symbolism that we mentioned in our previous message and that I referenced by way of introduction this evening

456
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,759
And you think about the flesh versus the spirit and you understand the flesh minds fleshly things

457
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,679
The flesh is interested in the here and now the immediate

458
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,439
the flesh as we see

459
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:56,319
Given through the actions of Esau says I need this now and I'm willing to forfeit whatever

460
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,959
I need to forfeit in order to get this that I need right now

461
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:05,479
And I sacrifice the future for the immediate.

462
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:09,839
Now we understand that God has a plan through all of this, and we'll mention that here

463
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,839
in just a moment.

464
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,079
But notice the Bible says in verse number 17, continuing in Hebrews 12, for ye know

465
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:21,539
how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found

466
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,559
no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

467
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,859
And here it's speaking of the seeking of Esau for the blessing, he sought the blessing

468
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:33,439
with tears.

469
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:38,319
He didn't seek repentance with tears, he sought the blessing with tears.

470
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,319
He was angered with his brother over what had transpired.

471
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:48,519
And we note here as we look at the circumstances in this particular text of Scripture, and

472
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,599
we note the behavior of Esau, and we can make application as to how we can operate in the

473
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:59,679
flesh, and how we need to be careful not to mind fleshly things.

474
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,359
That we would understand, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4, while we look not at these

475
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,239
things which are temporal, but at things which are eternal.

476
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:13,119
But I want to focus just for a moment on Jacob back in Genesis chapter number 25, because

477
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:19,559
when we look back at Jacob, and we find that often he speaks about his name closely associated

478
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,359
with actually about three different Hebrew words, but a couple of them carry with it

479
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:31,379
the idea of being a deceiver, and Jacob is known for that, and we understand that.

480
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:36,199
And here in this passage many times Jacob, we look at him and we still see the deception

481
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:41,679
and see what's going on, and how he manipulated the circumstances and so on and so forth.

482
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,119
But I want you to think about this from the perspective of Jacob just for a moment this

483
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,119
evening.

484
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,479
The Bible tells us that Jacob is there in verse number 29, and Jacob sod pottage, and

485
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:54,479
Esau came from the field and he was faint.

486
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:59,919
I don't think that Jacob had sod the pottage planning that this event was going to unfold

487
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,239
the way that it did.

488
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:07,599
But I do want to submit to you something that I think is important for us to understand,

489
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,279
that in verse number 23 the Bible says that there were two nations, there are two people,

490
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,439
and that the elder shall serve the younger.

491
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:21,759
I understand that you may disagree with this statement that I'll make, and we can certainly

492
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,239
talk about it, but I believe that it's possible.

493
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:33,439
I'm not saying that it's absolute, I'm suggesting that it's possible that Jacob would have known

494
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:39,039
from his mother Rebekah what God had told her in verse number 23.

495
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,279
Why would I make that suggestion?

496
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,159
Well, the Bible says that Rebekah loved Jacob.

497
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,199
We find that Rebekah, of course, in chapter number 27, she's going to scheme and work

498
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:54,039
and do what she's going to do in order to get Jacob in there to receive the blessing

499
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,219
from Isaac.

500
00:32:55,219 --> 00:33:00,159
But I would believe that as you think about the dysfunction that is mentioned in verse

501
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,799
number 28 between Isaac and Rebekah and Isaac loving Esau because of the venison and Rebekah

502
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,779
loving Jacob, I would suggest that it's at least possible that Jacob would have known

503
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,079
about this plan that God had revealed to Rebekah when she entreated of the Lord because of

504
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,439
the struggle within the womb.

505
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,439
Why does that matter?

506
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:24,999
I think it matters for this purpose.

507
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:30,939
I believe that he knew that that was the plan, but I believe that he sought to scheme to

508
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:34,039
accomplish what the plan was.

509
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,639
Does that make sense to you?

510
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:43,279
So I think as we look at the passage of Scripture and you say, what would make Jacob say to

511
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,599
Esau when he's faint, ready to die, he's made some soup, some pottage, and his brother comes

512
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:55,159
in from the hunt and he's ready to die, and he says, give me some of that soup, and he's

513
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:00,399
like, well, sell me your birthright.

514
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,079
What does that have to do with anything?

515
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,439
Where did that come into the equation?

516
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:11,119
And I think, as I look at the passage and meditate upon it, I think what's happening

517
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:20,759
here is that Jacob had some level of awareness of what God had revealed to Rebekah, and now

518
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:27,599
what Jacob is doing is he's taking matters in his own hands, and he's trying to scheme

519
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:32,759
in order to ensure that he gets the blessing that's associated with the birthright.

520
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,479
Does that make sense?

521
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:37,319
Now, here's what I'd say.

522
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:40,839
We don't have to scheme.

523
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,679
We don't have to scheme.

524
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,919
Sometimes in life, we feel like we have to step in and help God accomplish what God says

525
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,119
He's going to accomplish, right?

526
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,659
And the reality is that God's given us responsibility, and He's given us duty, and as He's given

527
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:04,119
us duty and responsibility, that's what we need to focus on, and we need to be focused

528
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,559
upon our duty and our responsibility, but we do not have to try to help God accomplish

529
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,839
His purpose, for God's purposes will be accomplished.

530
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,119
And as I look at this passage of Scripture, I believe that Jacob is scheming here, and

531
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,119
the reality is that if we're living by faith, if we're doing what God's told us to do and

532
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,439
we're focused on the duties and we're focused upon the responsibilities, I don't need to

533
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:34,479
scheme in order to get the blessing.

534
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:39,879
I'm not sure, as you look at the passage of Scripture, how much Jacob knew all that was

535
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:44,439
going on, but you think about this passage and think about what's going on, and for him

536
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:50,039
to say, sell me this day thy birthright, it was as if he had heard what his mother had

537
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,559
said with regard to the elder shall serve the younger in all that was contained there

538
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,199
in that verse of Scripture, in that revelation that God had given to Rebekah, that now you

539
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:08,519
come to the place that Jacob is saying, now's my opportunity, and the opportunity has presented

540
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:15,639
itself and I'm going to step in and I'm going to help accomplish this purpose.

541
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:21,799
And I find this evening that God doesn't need our help.

542
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:24,879
Let me explain that a little bit further.

543
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:34,079
The reality, again, is that we do have responsibilities and have duties, but God is going to fulfill

544
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,639
His purpose and His plan.

545
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,959
And there are many times when we look at the Scriptures and we look at other historical

546
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:49,079
figures and even look at our own lives, that perhaps we would try to scheme and devise

547
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:54,439
a plan and try to manipulate circumstances in order to accomplish something.

548
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:59,199
But the reality is that we need to just rest in God and allow God to do what only God can

549
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,599
do.

550
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,019
And when we do that, when we follow that process, we do not have to take the same course of

551
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:13,179
action that Jacob will take in chapter number 27, and you understand all that he dealt with.

552
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:16,859
And listen, there's some great things about Jacob that we'll study over the next several

553
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:21,879
chapters and some really insightful things that I believe are helpful for us, but the

554
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:28,599
reality is that Jacob had to learn some lessons, and I feel that here is the start, as God

555
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,819
has revealed it to us, of some of these problems that he's going to deal with.

556
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:40,139
And this evening, when we remember that God is God and that He is in control and that

557
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:46,519
Jacob in this situation, he was going to receive the blessing, he was going to be the recipient,

558
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,339
though the culture may have had some other idea and the birthright, the blessing, and

559
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:57,459
so on and so forth, God had made it clear and God would see to it.

560
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:01,539
And for us this evening, as we look at a passage of Scripture like this, we understand historically

561
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:02,779
what happens.

562
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:08,019
We see the difference, and it's a distinct difference, a contrast between Esau and Jacob,

563
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,659
and we see the dysfunction in the family, and we're sad to report that it continues

564
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:19,079
even to this very day in many families around our nation that are so dysfunctional.

565
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,139
But we find that as we look at the despised birthright, that yes, we can look at Esau,

566
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:31,339
and we can look at Esau compromising and forfeiting the future for the immediate and so on and

567
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:37,179
so forth, and there's various applications and beneficial applications to that truth

568
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:40,419
and to understanding that.

569
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:44,779
But I find that oftentimes we can skip right over Jacob in this passage of Scripture and

570
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:51,419
fail to recognize how Jacob was scheming, and he really didn't have to.

571
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:56,339
And I hope tonight that as we briefly look at this passage of Scripture that we would

572
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:01,459
resolve in our hearts and our minds that we're going to walk in the Spirit so that

573
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:06,339
we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, as we note the situation there with Esau and

574
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:12,939
note that he's a profane person and that the flesh and the spirit, the elder and the

575
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:17,539
younger, and we mentioned all of this in our last message, the reality is that the old

576
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:24,019
man is always going to be older than the new man, because you got saved at some point after

577
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:25,159
you were born.

578
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,719
You can't get saved if you've not been born, if you don't understand the truth of the gospel,

579
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:33,919
and so when we look at that truth, spiritual application, we must understand, listen, there

580
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:39,559
are times in which we can operate in the flesh and we can mind fleshly things, and we can

581
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:45,319
sacrifice the immediate, the temporal, or sacrifice the future, the eternal for the

582
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,199
immediate, for that which is needed right now, the fleshly things.

583
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,239
But I also want you to take a lesson from Jacob and say, I don't need the scheme.

584
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,639
I can just trust God.

585
00:39:59,639 --> 00:39:59,999
I can just...

586
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:04,999
Please trust God that He has a plan, and that He's going to see it through.

587
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,519
There are times in which we scheme.

588
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,079
Listen, in the very next text of Scripture we're going to read about Isaac scheming

589
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,239
with Rebekah and Abimelech and all that takes place, and he follows the same thing that

590
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,839
Abraham did.

591
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,799
I said to you on two occasions already as we studied Abraham, with Sarah, she's my sister,

592
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:29,959
I said it with regard to Pharaoh, and I said it with regard to Abimelech, I believe with

593
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:36,119
all of my heart that Abraham could have gone into both situations saying, she's my wife,

594
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,999
and God would have taken care of him.

595
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:43,279
I believe that with all my heart, because God is able.

596
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,279
But what was Abraham doing?

597
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,279
He was afraid.

598
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:50,559
Man, they're going to see how beautiful my wife is, and they're going to kill me for

599
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:56,779
her, and so let me say that she's my sister.

600
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,359
And God worked, did He not?

601
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:02,559
And He worked miraculously in both of those events, and He's going to do the same thing

602
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,359
in the next chapter, in chapter 26.

603
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,959
And what happens sometimes is we can get into this routine of scheming and manipulating and

604
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:16,119
trying to, but the reality is that we can just live resting and knowing that we fulfill

605
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,279
our duties and our responsibilities and that God is able to do what only God can do.

606
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,559
I don't need to scheme.

607
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:26,559
I don't need to manipulate.

608
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,359
I'm going to drive myself crazy, and you're going to drive yourself crazy if we try to

609
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,079
scheme and manipulate.

610
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,999
We just simply keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ and do what we're supposed to do and

611
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,119
trust Him for the results.

612
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,279
Amen?

613
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:46,079
And we find that here, yes, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob.

614
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,879
We'll see some of the significance of that in the next several chapters, and really the

615
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:56,439
significance of that historically as things go forward for the nation of Israel and their

616
00:41:56,439 --> 00:42:00,919
conflicts that take place with Edom over the centuries.

617
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:05,839
But this evening, let's take these takeaways from this passage of Scripture and determine

618
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,799
that we're going to apply truth and entrust God.

619
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:12,519
I don't need to scheme.

620
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:13,519
Stop it.

621
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,039
If I'm scheming, if I'm trying to manipulate, I can just stop and rest in God.

622
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,279
I'll finish with this story.

623
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:25,599
It's a personal testimony, and it was kind of interesting when you think about the plan

624
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,579
that God has and God having a plan for your life, and you trust Him and you believe Him.

625
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:35,039
And I believe that God is sovereign and that God is able.

626
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,839
And I remember when I believed that it was, and some of you have heard this story before.

627
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,559
I'll just say, I'll give you the brief version this evening.

628
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,439
But when we believed, Holly and I believed that it was time for us to go full-time in

629
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:53,279
ministry, there were several conversations that I had with some mentors and with some

630
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:57,199
counselors and what have you, and received counsel.

631
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,399
And the counsel that I got that was consistent across the board was, you just stay doing

632
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:07,239
what you're doing, serving God, being faithful, and God will work it out.

633
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,899
God knows where you are, and God knows where you need to be.

634
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:16,119
Just keep serving God, and you just wait on the Lord.

635
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,839
For the next probably nine months, that's what we did.

636
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:28,839
You know how many times I wanted to put my hand into the situation?

637
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,919
Seriously.

638
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:33,279
I could help God.

639
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,799
Now understand how I'm saying that.

640
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:40,719
I'm not saying that irreverently, but sometimes we think that way, right?

641
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,239
I can help God by finding the place where I'm supposed to go.

642
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:50,199
And if I start kind of making some calls, and if I start sending out some resumes, if

643
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:56,999
I start going some places and preaching, then I can kind of, right?

644
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:57,999
I didn't.

645
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:00,279
I wanted to.

646
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,559
I really wanted to at times.

647
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:08,519
Not because I was trying to run from anything, but because I really wanted to be in the ministry.

648
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:11,239
And we just waited on God.

649
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,259
Just waited on God.

650
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:18,559
And we'd hear about this church that needed a pastor, and, oh man, it was so hard not

651
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,159
to go talk to the people and find out some information and let them know that we were

652
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,959
looking to pastor a church, but just didn't.

653
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,479
Just waited on God.

654
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:33,119
And about nine months after that whole process happened is when I heard about a church in

655
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,119
Oakton, Virginia.

656
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,199
And many of you know all of the details, and I won't take the time this evening to talk

657
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:39,879
about it.

658
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:49,919
But it's just absolutely amazing to see how God worked it all out without my help.

659
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:50,999
And let me say this.

660
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,439
I believe this.

661
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:56,879
I could be wrong, but I believe this.

662
00:44:56,879 --> 00:45:02,719
If I would have done what I wanted to do, I never would have come here to be the pastor.

663
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:03,719
You know why?

664
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:06,159
I would have ended up somewhere else before this door ever opened.

665
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,279
You know how many churches there are in America that don't have pastors?

666
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:11,279
Lots.

667
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:15,319
A lot.

668
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:16,959
You can find your place.

669
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:18,999
You can get in somewhere.

670
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,599
But is it where God wants you?

671
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:21,599
Right?

672
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,999
You understand what I'm saying?

673
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:28,439
And I believe with all my heart that if I would have done at times what I felt like

674
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:33,699
doing, we never would have come here.

675
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,339
Not because I didn't want to come here.

676
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,059
Don't misunderstand.

677
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:41,099
I would have ended up being somewhere else already.

678
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:48,779
And when that phone call went from the previous pastor to Evangelist Mershon, and he said,

679
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,899
do you know a young pastor or a young preacher that you could recommend?

680
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:57,299
I wouldn't even have been on his radar because I was already a pastor in another church.

681
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,219
Does it make sense?

682
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:04,819
And so at times in our lives, listen, the temptation is there to think that we can help

683
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:11,539
God scheme and devise and manipulate and whatever.

684
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:19,999
And it takes, it's hard, it's not easy to just wait on God and let God work it all out.

685
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:25,219
And when you do, you see that God is able to do what only God can do.

686
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:29,659
And I'll say this to close the story.

687
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:34,739
It's exciting to me that when you see God work all of those details out, that you can

688
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:42,859
have a great peace in knowing that you're exactly where God wants you to be.

689
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:47,659
How many times we could force our way into something and then face trouble and problems

690
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:50,579
and say, man, maybe this wasn't the right place I was supposed to be.

691
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,939
I kind of manipulated some circumstances and I kind of whatever, and man, it turned out

692
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:56,659
to be a mess.

693
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:57,659
And that's because I'm at the wrong place.

694
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:05,259
When you just let God, you can have a great peace that I'm where God wants me to be.

695
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:06,259
Amen?

696
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,219
And so let's learn that lesson from Jacob tonight.

697
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:09,539
Father, we love You.

698
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:11,859
We thank You for loving us.

699
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:13,979
We thank You for the Word of God.

700
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:17,459
And as we look at this passage, we understand the significance of the birthright.

701
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,779
We understand the blessing that's associated with it.

702
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:23,179
We understand that Esau sold his birthright.

703
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:27,379
He despised his birthright.

704
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:36,499
We know the implications of this passage of Scripture on future accounts that we'll read.

705
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:45,259
I pray that You'd help us not to mind earthly things and fleshly things as Esau did.

706
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:54,459
But Lord, I pray that also You'd help us with this application with regard to Jacob.

707
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:59,099
And God, we'd just rest in Thee.

708
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,939
Allow You to do what only You can do.

709
00:48:00,939 --> 00:48:07,139
Help us to focus on our duties and our responsibilities and being faithful to fulfill those things

710
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:14,179
that You've called us to do, and then just simply rest in You.

711
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:20,659
Not feeling as if we have to scheme or manipulate, but that we can simply trust You and see You

712
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:21,659
work.

713
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:27,099
Father, I pray that You would bless our time of invitation.

714
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:32,799
Perhaps You've taken this evening and spoken to someone specifically from this portion

715
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:36,899
of Scripture, whether it's through something that I've said or something the Holy Spirit

716
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:37,899
spoke to them about.

717
00:48:37,899 --> 00:48:42,259
Lord, I pray that we'd be responsive and that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers

718
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:44,419
only.

719
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:47,739
Work as only You can, and we'll give You the glory for it's in Christ's name we pray.

720
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:48,379
Would You stand with me?
