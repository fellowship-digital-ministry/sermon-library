WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
number 25 this evening, Genesis chapter number 25, and we'll look at verses 27 down through

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.479
verse number 34. In the preceding text that we studied a couple of weeks ago on Sunday evening,

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.879
Genesis 25, verses 19 through 26, we had the opportunity to read in that portion of Scripture

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:26.079
about the birth of Esau and Jacob. And of course, as we looked at that portion of Scripture,

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:33.520
we noted, of course, the supplication. We noted that Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife. Why?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.520
Because she was barren. But then we also learned how that Rebecca sought the face of God. Why?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
Because there was this struggle within her. And so we spoke about the supplication, we spoke of

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.639
the struggle, and then we looked at some symbolism in that preceding text. As we move forward into

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:55.840
the text of Scripture this evening in this chapter, we find the Bible simply says in verse

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.479
number 27, and the boys grew. And now all of a sudden, we're looking at an event that takes

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.559
place much later in life. In verses 20, really 19 through 26, we have the opportunity of hearing of

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:12.480
their birth. The Bible tells us in verse number 26, and after that, speaking of Esau, now Jacob

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.519
being born, and after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:22.239
And his name was called Jacob, and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.160
And then the Bible tells us that the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.279
and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents. It says in verse number 32, look at verse 33 with me,

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:39.279
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. And he swear unto him, and he sold his birthright

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:44.239
unto Jacob. And so the title for the message, as you see in the bulletin this evening,

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:50.720
is Esau sold his birthright to Jacob. When we mention the symbolism that was noted as it's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.400
given to us in verse number 23, we really spoke of two things. One was this, there are two nations,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.720
and we understood the contextual application here of the interpretation that there are two nations

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.399
within thy womb. That was when she, Rebekah, had sought the Lord with regard to the struggle that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.479
was within her. And God says, there are two nations that are within thy womb in verse number

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:21.600
23. And we understand that Jacob becomes Israel, the nation of the people of God, the Israelites.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.559
And then Esau, he becomes Edom, or as we often see in the Word of God, the Edomites. And you find

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:33.600
that throughout the scriptures, especially in the Old Testament in particular, you see that there's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.360
great conflict regularly that you read of between the children of Israel, the descendants of Jacob,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.880
and the Edomites, the descendants of Esau. And you see regularly these representations and these

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:55.839
disagreements and these battles between these two groups of people. But we said that not only

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:01.759
was it that there were two nations—remember, God continues and says, two men are people—shall

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.759
be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall be stronger than the other people,

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:14.320
and the elder shall serve the younger. And we see that God is giving insight with regard to His plan.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.919
We looked at Romans 9 and discussed some of that in our last message. But we also noted that the

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.199
application of this passage of scripture, or one application that we could look at, is not only

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:31.600
the two nations, but there are two natures. And we dealt with this not only looking at Esau and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.800
Jacob, but we also looked at this several months ago when we looked at the distinction between

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.080
Ishmael and Isaac. And remember, Ishmael, after the birth of Isaac, that Ishmael and Hagar were

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.800
cast out. Remember, God told Abraham to, yes, take heed to what Sarah said and cast them out.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.320
And so we find that in like manner, as you see with Ishmael and Isaac, you find here with Esau

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.679
and Jacob that there's these two natures, and we made the application of the old man versus the new

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:07.839
man, the desires of the flesh versus the fruit of the Spirit, the work of the flesh versus the

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:13.440
fruit of the Spirit. And we understand the struggle that we deal with. We understand that after

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.519
salvation, that the new man has the desires that God gives, but we still have this flesh. It is not

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.320
eradicated. We are to crucify our flesh. We are to mortify our flesh. But the reality is that that is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.320
a day-by-day decision that we make as we walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.679
the flesh. And as we look at that really by backdrop, we fast forward to the text of scripture

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:45.119
that is before us now, and we see that the Bible tells us that the boys grew in verse number 27.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.359
And Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. We

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:59.119
see if you're taking notes this evening, a distinct difference is noted. In one single verse of

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:06.640
scripture, God gives us here in verse number 27 this distinct difference between Esau and Jacob.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.440
We've already noted that the Bible tells us of the two nations. We've made the application with

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.279
regard to the two natures. But even in their physical lives, you see that there is a great

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:25.359
contrast between these two brothers, these twins. The Bible tells us that Esau is a cunning hunter,

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:31.600
a man of the field. And yet we find the Bible says of Jacob that he is a plain man, dwelling

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.000
in tents. The reality is that the differences in which we find not only here within this text of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.119
scripture with these two men, these brothers, but even differences that we have within our own

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.760
families and within differences that people have one with another, the differences are to be

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.160
expected. But we really find that through looking at some of this, even what's noted in verse number

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.040
27 and definitely in the following verses of scripture, that you really see the outworking

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.640
of what we discussed in our previous message with regard to the two nations and the two natures.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:14.160
And really the desire for carnal or fleshly things, the immediate, if you will, versus the

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.559
desire for the eternal things, those things which are spiritual. And so we know that these differences

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:25.519
are here. Yes, they were different in appearance. We see that the Bible tells us in verse number 25,

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.079
the first, speaking of Esau, came out red all over like an hairy garment,

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:35.760
and they called his name Esau. And no doubt there was a distinct difference even in their

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.880
appearance, as we note in verse 25 and 26 between Esau and Jacob. But we also note that there's a

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.959
distinct difference in their pursuits and the pursuits that are mentioned here in verse 27.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:54.399
We don't know how much time has passed. We don't know, even as we mentioned in our previous message

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.959
and as we've gone through these couple of chapters, that not all of these events are in

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:04.559
strict chronological order here in these chapters of the book of Genesis. For we looked at the

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:10.239
burial of Abraham at the beginning of chapter number 25, but even at that time, we find that

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:15.920
Jacob and Esau would have been 15 years old, and yet their birth is not dealt with until later in

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.040
the passage of scripture. And so it's not in strict chronological order, but we are not certain as to

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.440
how much time has passed between their birth and now this particular time. It does seem, as you look

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.279
at the text of scripture, that Isaac and Rebekah are not fully aware of everything that's going to

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:40.320
transpire in this particular text, perhaps not being there at the time. That's really not completely

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.040
necessary to the text of scripture, but though it's worth pointing out with regard to what

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:50.799
happens in chapter 27, and we'll look at that in a few weeks. Let me say this, as we note the

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:55.600
distinct difference, I want you to note in the next verse of scripture, it seems as if there's

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.200
a dysfunctional family. I mentioned this morning in the message, I mentioned about sibling rivalry,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.359
and I mentioned about preaching on Esau and Jacob this evening, and I did make the statement

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:10.480
about a dysfunctional family. And I think when you look at this particular verse of scripture

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.040
and then see the outworking of what we find in verse number 28, and you look at the fullness of

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.000
that as it's revealed in Genesis chapter 27, you'll see that there's a dysfunctional family

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.440
here. The Bible says in Isaac, that's dad of course, Isaac loved Esau. Why? Because he did

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:39.280
eat of his venison. And the Bible says, but Rebekah loved Jacob. And so there's some

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.960
dysfunction here, it would seem. It's not, we don't get a bunch of detail. He doesn't go into it.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.479
God doesn't provide all of these details, but we find what we read here in verse number 28 is very

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:55.840
insightful when you start looking at what happens in chapter 27. I don't want to get too far ahead

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.559
of myself in our study of the book of Genesis, but you'll know that in chapter number 27,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:05.840
it was when Isaac called Esau, and he told Esau he was going to give him a blessing. Remember,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.320
go out and get that venison, prepare it, the kind that I love, and I'll give you a blessing. And

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.679
Rebekah overhears that, and Rebekah schemes and has a meal prepared and sends Jacob in, and

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:22.479
Jacob's concerned because, you know, dad's going to know that it's not me, and so on and so forth.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:29.440
And really, you see the statement here in Genesis 25 and verse number 28 that leads us to really

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.479
seeing the outworking of this dysfunction in chapter number 27. Now, the thing that's interesting

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:41.119
to me that we'll make quick note of here in this verse of Scripture is that it's very sad to me

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:46.960
that even as you would see the dysfunction within the family here, we continue to this day to see

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:54.159
dysfunctional families. We continue to this day to find that there are families that have been given

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:59.919
the truth with regard to what God's plan is, and yet there are times in which

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:02.379
God's plan is rejected.

00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:07.119
God had made it clear to Rebecca as she prayed

00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:09.199
and sought the Lord and inquired of the Lord

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:10.839
with regard to the struggle,

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.759
that the elder shall serve the younger, right?

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.039
That's what God told her.

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:18.319
And in chapter number 27, we find that really,

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:22.799
there's a point, a purpose really of Isaac

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:25.639
to give the blessing to Esau.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.799
And we find that God's plan had already been revealed

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:30.759
to them back in chapter 25,

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:33.599
and this dysfunction begins to reveal itself

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.519
in all sorts of manners.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.519
And you find that what happens is after the Esau

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.559
returns in chapter 27,

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:44.399
he's pretty happy with Jacob, isn't he?

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:47.719
No, he's ready to kill him, right?

00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:49.519
So what does Isaac have to do?

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.039
What does Rebecca say?

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.079
I'm gonna send you away.

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:54.719
Go away for a little while.

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:58.719
A little while turned into years and years

00:10:59.479 --> 00:11:00.319
and years.

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.959
Go away for a little while, why?

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:04.159
Because your brother's anger will soon pass

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.799
after the grieving of your father.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.519
And we find this dysfunction,

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.279
and when we begin to go down the path

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:16.519
of not following the plan that God has revealed,

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.839
we see that there are bad consequences to that.

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.119
And in our society today,

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:24.359
we've mentioned many times over the years

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:26.039
that the family is under attack.

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:29.199
Why is it that the enemy wants to attack the family?

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:32.879
You have to have a strong family.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:35.159
When you do not have strong families,

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:37.119
you're not gonna have a strong society.

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:40.479
From a spiritual aspect,

00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:43.079
when you think about the strength of families,

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:45.279
it is imperative to have strong families

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.919
in order to have a strong church.

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:51.919
Strong churches are made up of strong families.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.919
It's just the way it is.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.959
And we see the dysfunction here in Genesis chapter 25

00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.959
within the home of Isaac and Rebekah

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:01.799
where Isaac loves Esau.

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:02.639
Why?

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.879
Because of the venison that he ate,

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:05.399
but Rebekah loved Jacob.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.959
And there's this, you know,

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.439
as the scriptures unfold this to me,

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:12.519
no doubt in my mind that there was known tension

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.439
in the home.

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:16.839
No doubt in my mind this was known by the children.

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:18.439
I know that there are times,

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:20.359
I remember even with my brother,

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:23.599
still to this day we'll joke about who's the favorite

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.079
and we all know, I'll say publicly,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.559
we all know that my brother is the favorite.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:33.559
But the reality is that we just play with that, right?

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.839
But can you imagine if you're really living

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.839
in a situation where you're dealing

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.119
with this level of dysfunction?

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:44.399
It's challenging, difficult.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:48.279
And we find that this is the verse of scripture

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.439
that gives us kind of a setting and a background

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:52.479
for the family that we're dealing with.

00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:56.279
And we see this, again, still being a problem today

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.239
with this dysfunctional family.

00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:00.199
The bulk of the text this evening deals

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:02.439
with our final point, and it's only 625,

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:04.079
but just, it's okay.

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:06.039
We'll be at this final point for a while.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:09.119
And it's a despised birthright.

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:10.279
A despised birthright.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.119
You understand that the birthright was valuable.

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:14.959
We find that in biblical times

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:16.639
and even in many cultures today

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:19.039
around the face of the planet,

00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:21.439
that this is quite significant

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:24.359
when you speak about the birthright, the firstborn.

00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:26.479
It continues to be a very significant thing.

00:13:26.479 --> 00:13:29.519
There are plenty of nations around the globe today

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:33.559
that have cultures that are still very much focused

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:36.959
upon birthrights and firstborn and birth order

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.519
and so on and so forth and the significance of that.

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.199
And we really see it scripturally.

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:42.399
We understand that scripturally,

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.119
there's many references that are made

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:47.519
with regard to the firstborn and the birthright

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:48.359
and what have you.

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:49.919
And so it's quite significant.

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:53.999
And the birthright is absolutely a valuable thing.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:57.559
And we find that God, just as he has,

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.719
and he will in other instances,

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:02.679
he's given the truth in verse number 23

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:06.039
as he spoke to Rebekah in answering her inquiry

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.839
with regard to the struggle,

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.479
that the one people shall be stronger than the other people

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:13.119
and the elder shall serve the younger.

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:16.199
And we find that when you think about the birthright

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:20.039
in the firstborn, that this would be opposite

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:22.439
of how the normal outworking would be,

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:24.639
but this is what God's plan was.

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.079
When we think about the birthright,

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:28.679
and we think about the significance of the birthright,

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:30.399
it's interesting if you would be mindful

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.079
of just a couple of other times in the scriptures.

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.079
I'll just reference a couple this evening

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.399
as with regard to the significance.

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.479
Look over in Genesis chapter 43.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:42.399
In Genesis chapter 43, just to give you the quick background

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:45.159
of what's going on, Joseph, of course,

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:47.919
has been there in Egypt.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:50.799
And we find that as he's there in Egypt

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:54.319
that he's, of course, in control

00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:55.759
and he's got so much power

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:59.599
because of the interpretation of Pharaoh's dream

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:00.879
and all that's taken place.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:05.879
And the plague, the famine, not only affected Egypt,

00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:07.479
but it affected everywhere.

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:10.279
And we find that there was no food in Canaan.

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:14.659
And so what happened, Jacob sent the boys to Egypt.

00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:17.339
And after the first visit there,

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:20.059
we find that it was made clear

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:23.619
that unless the youngest came,

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:26.179
they would not see his face, right?

00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:28.059
So Jacob is bothered by that.

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:28.899
Why?

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:30.739
Because he believes that Joseph is already dead

00:15:30.739 --> 00:15:33.859
and now mischief is going to fall upon Benjamin.

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:36.539
And this is just a terrible situation.

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.019
And we understand we won't go through all of it,

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:40.259
but we come to the point

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:42.419
where all of the brothers are now there.

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:46.519
And the Bible tells us that here in this text of scripture

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:50.139
that he, Joseph, he's not yet made himself known.

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:52.659
He doesn't do that until chapter 45.

00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:55.339
But at the end of chapter number 43,

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:58.019
he tells them all that they're going to have a meal

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.559
and they all gather together.

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:01.339
And notice what it says in verse 33.

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:03.779
This is of interest just to see the reference

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.859
that is made to the birth order

00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.759
and to the significance of the firstborn.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.299
It says, and they sat before him, the firstborn,

00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:12.859
according to his birthright,

00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:15.579
and the youngest, according to his youth.

00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:19.539
Notice what it says, and the men marveled one at another.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:21.579
And we understand, of course,

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:24.659
that there's some indication within that

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:26.259
where they're wondering how in the world

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:27.839
did he know what our birth order was

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:29.379
and so on and so forth.

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:31.219
But it's certainly interesting

00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:33.779
how this would have been customary

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.619
when you think about the birth order

00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:39.299
and just the process and the birthright.

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:41.699
We find that in Deuteronomy chapter 21,

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.899
turn over there, and I want you to note

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:45.539
what happens in Deuteronomy 21

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:48.459
as God is giving instruction to the people of God

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:50.219
as they would be preparing to enter

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:52.539
into the land of promise.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:56.659
And of course, really kind of a review of the law

00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:58.819
that's been given and all of the requirements

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:00.059
and what have you.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:03.539
Notice in Deuteronomy 21 in verse number 17,

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:05.099
the Bible says this.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.019
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:12.299
for the firstborn by giving him a double portion

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.979
of all that he hath.

00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:16.099
For he is the beginning of his strength,

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.299
the right of the firstborn is his.

00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:22.739
Now, what's being discussed in the previous verses

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:25.299
of Scripture is if a man has more than one wife

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:27.139
and he has one wife that's beloved

00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:28.699
and another wife that isn't,

00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:32.459
that he could not choose who he would bestow

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:37.259
the blessing of the firstborn based upon the mother.

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.139
It had to be by the birth order,

00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:42.779
the birthright that was given.

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:46.259
And it says this at the end of verse number 17,

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:48.779
by giving him a double portion of all that he hath,

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:50.119
for he is the beginning of his strength,

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:54.259
notice the right of the firstborn is his.

00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:56.539
So birthright in the firstborn,

00:17:56.539 --> 00:17:58.699
it's significant, it's valuable.

00:17:58.699 --> 00:18:01.379
We do find that the blessing that was attached

00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:03.179
or associated with the firstborn,

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:05.219
with the birthright could be lost.

00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:07.579
You remember that is, and we won't turn there

00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:10.659
and deal with it, but in Genesis chapter 48 and 49,

00:18:10.659 --> 00:18:13.019
when Jacob is ready to die and he's going

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:16.779
to bestow his blessings upon his family,

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:19.859
the blessing that would be for Reuben,

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:23.339
who was the firstborn, was actually not given to Reuben,

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:27.219
but it was given to Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.

00:18:27.219 --> 00:18:28.059
Why?

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:30.779
Because of the sin of Reuben, right?

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:33.179
And so because of the sin of Reuben,

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:37.179
he had really forfeited, he lost the blessing

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:40.739
that was attached to that firstborn, to that birthright,

00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:42.820
because of his sinful behavior.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.320
In fact, in Genesis chapter number 49,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.760
when Jacob begins to address him,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.779
because he is the firstborn,

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:51.919
he says that he's the beginning of my strength,

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:54.099
but he says that he's unstable as water,

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.700
thou shalt not excel, why?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.299
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:01.059
then defilest thou it, he went up to my couch,

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:06.179
and because of his sin, then we find that that was,

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:09.179
the blessing was lost as a result of that

00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:12.479
that was associated with the firstborn, that birthright.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.700
It also seems, as we look at the passage here,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.739
and by the way, First Chronicles deals with that as well,

00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:21.419
as you look at the chronological events

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:23.419
that are going on with Reuben,

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:26.299
and that blessing being given to Ephraim and Manasseh,

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:28.419
the sons of Joseph, you can look at First Chronicles

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:31.419
chapter five, and see that there as well.

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:32.979
But it seems evident,

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:35.979
through looking at this passage of scripture,

00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:38.219
that the birthright also could be used

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.779
as something that you could trade

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.179
because of the value of it.

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.739
I don't think that Jacob just thought this up,

00:19:44.739 --> 00:19:48.219
and just kind of, on the occasion that is before us,

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:49.039
was like, you know what,

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.339
I think maybe I'll take your birthright.

00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:55.459
This was something that evidently was practiced,

00:19:55.459 --> 00:19:57.979
or at least known to be practiced,

00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.579
and we find that it's understood.

00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:07.859
Understanding what's taking place in the value of a birthright that we're told in this text of Scripture that Esau sold his birthright

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:15.299
He sold it to Jacob the scriptures tell us that Esau at the end of the chapter in verse number 34 that he despised

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:17.419
his birthright

00:20:17.419 --> 00:20:20.739
The word despised means to disdain to abhor

00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:23.799
to have the lowest opinion of

00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:26.059
Now, can you imagine?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:32.219
When you understand the significance and the value of this birthright and what we've just kind of discussed briefly

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:38.039
With regard to the birthright and the firstborn for for Jacob, excuse me for Esau to have

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:42.519
It said of him that he despised his birthright

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.579
It's very insightful as to the character of this man

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:54.339
That we've mentioned in previous messages as we look at this passage notice with me in verse number 29 and we get the setting of

00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:59.979
What's taking place the Bible told us that that Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field

00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:05.659
But Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and in verse number 29. It says that Jacob sod pottage

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:11.619
He's at home. He's he's at the the home front. He's made this meal

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:16.579
He's got this thick soup of red lentils that evidently as it continues

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:21.499
You kind of see that that's what is mentioned with the color of it and so on and so forth and we find that this

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:28.059
Pottage he's made this meal and the Bible says that Esau came from the field and he was faint

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:34.539
And so Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and he's out there hunting and he's not able to take any game

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:41.339
He's exhausted after this hunt and no doubt as this would be his

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:45.659
manner of receiving some type of sustenance for his

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:48.419
welfare and for his

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:50.419
food that he is

00:21:50.899 --> 00:21:53.019
Persistent on trying to find something

00:21:53.579 --> 00:22:00.099
That he can take and yet the Bible tells us that he came from the field and it seems quite evident that he had no

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:06.619
Spoil, he brought back nothing and the Bible says that he was faint. He was faint. I've never hunted. I

00:22:07.739 --> 00:22:12.539
Don't know that I ever have a desire to hunt most of the people that I speak to about hunting love it

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.479
and then you hear those stories about people that sit in the

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:23.559
Tree stand or sitting somewhere else and it's 15 degrees and it's snowing and it's this and it's that and they didn't see anything all

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:27.639
Day long and I just don't understand what is so appealing about that

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:33.519
It's just me and I know some of you like to hunt my brother-in-law's try to get me to go hunting with them many times

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:37.919
And I'm like, I'm just not interested in that. I have a house. I have warmth

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:41.159
I have food that I can go and get that somebody else's already

00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:44.359
Butchered for me. I'm liking that and

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:48.199
The reality is that it is

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:54.959
After you go out and you think about this situation with Esau, it's a tiring process

00:22:56.359 --> 00:23:01.519
It's a lot of work and if he's out there and he's looking to get something

00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:06.359
It's almost it's it's interesting because in chapter 26 it talks about there being a famine in the land

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:11.399
And again, we don't know about the exactness of the chronological events here and how they're laid out

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:15.239
But we find that when he comes back in this exhausting hunt

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:21.359
However long that he was out and however long this process was and he finally comes back and he's faint

00:23:22.719 --> 00:23:24.359
he's faint and

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:32.279
He needs some level of sustenance and the Bible says that Esau speaks to Jacob in verse number 30 and said feed

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:37.799
Me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint

00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:40.639
Therefore was his name called Edom

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:44.159
We've already mentioned that in verse number 25

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:46.159
It talks about how he came out red

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:53.279
and that he's the the father of excuse me called his name Esau and then here he mentions the red pottage again and

00:23:53.879 --> 00:23:57.199
Therefore his name was called Edom the the word Edom means red

00:23:57.199 --> 00:24:02.839
And so there's some level of indication there between both of these things, but notice what is said in verse 31

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.159
Notice what Jacob says?

00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:08.439
Sell me this day

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:10.519
thy birthright

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:16.999
Now I don't pretend to understand all of the dysfunction within the family and I don't pretend to understand everything

00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:23.159
That these boys have dealt with because we don't know the scriptures are don't give us all the details

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:28.759
It simply tells us that they the boys grew and tells us that now there's this event

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:31.839
And so I don't know of all of the sibling rivalry

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:34.239
I don't know of all of the things that had taken place

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:37.199
But I do know that when Esau is at his

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:43.719
Wits end so to speak because that's really where we see him and as he gives his description as we go through the text

00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:47.119
He's at this wits end after being out hunting an unsuccessful

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:53.879
Hunt he comes back empty-handed and he's faint and he says give me some of that red pottage

00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:57.839
I am faint and Jacob says sell me this day thy birthright

00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:01.479
Sell me this day thy birthright

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:04.079
notice what Esau says in verse 32

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.799
behold I

00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:09.199
am at the point to die and

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:14.199
What profit shall this birthright do to me?

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:18.919
When I mentioned a moment ago that it's as if he's at wits end

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:25.919
And he says here that I'm at the point to die. It helps us understand the gravity of the situation

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:27.559
It helps us to understand

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:33.559
the length perhaps of the hunt that he was on and how long he was out in the field and how long he was

00:25:33.639 --> 00:25:35.639
pursuing after some type of

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:39.259
Catch that he could have so that he could feed in

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:44.719
Enjoy that sustenance and we find that he says I'm at the point to die

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:52.959
There are times in our lives if I could make a simple application from this verse of Scripture that we are at a place

00:25:53.759 --> 00:25:56.759
Where the psalmist refers to it as being at wits end

00:25:57.519 --> 00:26:00.479
That we're not in a good state to make decisions

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:02.479
Right

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:10.879
We're at the the place of of not thinking properly of not having the biblical influence that we need to have of

00:26:10.879 --> 00:26:12.879
Perhaps just leaning on

00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:20.239
the the carnal the flesh and obviously we see that in Esau and that's the some symbolism that we see in his life and

00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:27.239
No doubt even in this particular situation. He needs something now and he's concerned about the immediate

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:29.279
The

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:33.279
Bible says and Jacob said in verse 33

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:38.039
swear to me this day and he swear unto him and

00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:41.059
He sold his birthright

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:43.559
unto Jacob I

00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:47.679
Mentioned that it seems evident as you look at the passage of Scripture that this

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:52.119
Trading or selling of a birthright was something that could be done

00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:57.839
I'm not sure at how often it was practiced or how popular the practice was but no doubt

00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:04.759
There's an agreement that is made the the inquiry sell me this day thy birthright and Jacob then says

00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:12.279
To Esau after Esau says what profit does this birthright have to me Jacob says I want you to swear to it

00:27:13.159 --> 00:27:19.879
Swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob and then the Bible says then

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:25.839
Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink

00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:28.879
Rose up and went his way

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:31.119
thus Esau

00:27:31.199 --> 00:27:33.199
despised his birthright

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:40.439
the significance of this account that is given to us again with not a ton of detail that's provided is

00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:46.799
Seen in upcoming passages of Scripture that we'll study and we understand the significance of this

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:53.039
Particular event and as we look at this in future lessons and messages, we'll be able to reference back

00:27:53.279 --> 00:28:00.559
but we find that the Bible says that that Jacob then gives Esau this food and he ate and he drank and

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:03.559
Then he rose up and went his way

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:07.679
Despised his birthright notice keep your hand here in Genesis 26

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:15.039
But notice what the scriptures tell us in the book of Hebrews in the 12th chapter how this man Esau is described

00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:21.639
in Hebrews chapter number 12 in verse number 16, the Bible gives us a description of

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:25.679
This man Esau. It's not a very good description

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:32.079
Again as we interpret Scripture with Scripture and compare Scripture with Scripture we get we gather

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:37.479
Additional insight and notice what God says in Hebrews 12 in verse number 16

00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:43.719
Lest there be any fornicator notice or profane person as Esau

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:47.039
Who for one morsel of meat sold?

00:28:47.399 --> 00:28:53.919
His birthright two things that I would take away from this particular statement that is given to us in verse number 16 is

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:56.079
the way in which the scriptures

00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:58.479
authenticate the record of Genesis

00:28:59.199 --> 00:29:04.239
So many people think that the the scriptures are so independent one of another

00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:10.079
But the reality is that when you study the New Testament, it's really exciting to see how the New Testament

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:16.079
Authenticates the Old Testament in the accounts that you read of as their reference back to

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:18.759
Help see that authentication

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:25.919
But we also see that the Bible refers to Esau as being this profane person. It really just simply means this ungodly

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.399
ungodly

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.719
and and when you think about the the

00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:36.399
Symbolism that we mentioned in our previous message and that I referenced by way of introduction this evening

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:41.759
And you think about the flesh versus the spirit and you understand the flesh minds fleshly things

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:46.679
The flesh is interested in the here and now the immediate

00:29:47.439 --> 00:29:49.439
the flesh as we see

00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:56.319
Given through the actions of Esau says I need this now and I'm willing to forfeit whatever

00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:59.959
I need to forfeit in order to get this that I need right now

00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:05.479
And I sacrifice the future for the immediate.

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:09.839
Now we understand that God has a plan through all of this, and we'll mention that here

00:30:09.839 --> 00:30:10.839
in just a moment.

00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:15.079
But notice the Bible says in verse number 17, continuing in Hebrews 12, for ye know

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:21.539
how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found

00:30:21.539 --> 00:30:25.559
no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:31.859
And here it's speaking of the seeking of Esau for the blessing, he sought the blessing

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:33.439
with tears.

00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:38.319
He didn't seek repentance with tears, he sought the blessing with tears.

00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:42.319
He was angered with his brother over what had transpired.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:48.519
And we note here as we look at the circumstances in this particular text of Scripture, and

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:54.599
we note the behavior of Esau, and we can make application as to how we can operate in the

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:59.679
flesh, and how we need to be careful not to mind fleshly things.

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:04.359
That we would understand, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4, while we look not at these

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:08.239
things which are temporal, but at things which are eternal.

00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:13.119
But I want to focus just for a moment on Jacob back in Genesis chapter number 25, because

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:19.559
when we look back at Jacob, and we find that often he speaks about his name closely associated

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:25.359
with actually about three different Hebrew words, but a couple of them carry with it

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:31.379
the idea of being a deceiver, and Jacob is known for that, and we understand that.

00:31:31.379 --> 00:31:36.199
And here in this passage many times Jacob, we look at him and we still see the deception

00:31:36.199 --> 00:31:41.679
and see what's going on, and how he manipulated the circumstances and so on and so forth.

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:46.119
But I want you to think about this from the perspective of Jacob just for a moment this

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:47.119
evening.

00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:52.479
The Bible tells us that Jacob is there in verse number 29, and Jacob sod pottage, and

00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:54.479
Esau came from the field and he was faint.

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:59.919
I don't think that Jacob had sod the pottage planning that this event was going to unfold

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:02.239
the way that it did.

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:07.599
But I do want to submit to you something that I think is important for us to understand,

00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:13.279
that in verse number 23 the Bible says that there were two nations, there are two people,

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:17.439
and that the elder shall serve the younger.

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:21.759
I understand that you may disagree with this statement that I'll make, and we can certainly

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:25.239
talk about it, but I believe that it's possible.

00:32:25.239 --> 00:32:33.439
I'm not saying that it's absolute, I'm suggesting that it's possible that Jacob would have known

00:32:33.439 --> 00:32:39.039
from his mother Rebekah what God had told her in verse number 23.

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.279
Why would I make that suggestion?

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:45.159
Well, the Bible says that Rebekah loved Jacob.

00:32:45.159 --> 00:32:49.199
We find that Rebekah, of course, in chapter number 27, she's going to scheme and work

00:32:49.199 --> 00:32:54.039
and do what she's going to do in order to get Jacob in there to receive the blessing

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:55.219
from Isaac.

00:32:55.219 --> 00:33:00.159
But I would believe that as you think about the dysfunction that is mentioned in verse

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:05.799
number 28 between Isaac and Rebekah and Isaac loving Esau because of the venison and Rebekah

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:12.779
loving Jacob, I would suggest that it's at least possible that Jacob would have known

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:18.079
about this plan that God had revealed to Rebekah when she entreated of the Lord because of

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:20.439
the struggle within the womb.

00:33:20.439 --> 00:33:21.439
Why does that matter?

00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:24.999
I think it matters for this purpose.

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:30.939
I believe that he knew that that was the plan, but I believe that he sought to scheme to

00:33:30.939 --> 00:33:34.039
accomplish what the plan was.

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:36.639
Does that make sense to you?

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:43.279
So I think as we look at the passage of Scripture and you say, what would make Jacob say to

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:50.599
Esau when he's faint, ready to die, he's made some soup, some pottage, and his brother comes

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:55.159
in from the hunt and he's ready to die, and he says, give me some of that soup, and he's

00:33:55.159 --> 00:34:00.399
like, well, sell me your birthright.

00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:03.079
What does that have to do with anything?

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:06.439
Where did that come into the equation?

00:34:06.439 --> 00:34:11.119
And I think, as I look at the passage and meditate upon it, I think what's happening

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:20.759
here is that Jacob had some level of awareness of what God had revealed to Rebekah, and now

00:34:20.759 --> 00:34:27.599
what Jacob is doing is he's taking matters in his own hands, and he's trying to scheme

00:34:27.759 --> 00:34:32.759
in order to ensure that he gets the blessing that's associated with the birthright.

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:34.479
Does that make sense?

00:34:34.479 --> 00:34:37.319
Now, here's what I'd say.

00:34:37.319 --> 00:34:40.839
We don't have to scheme.

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:43.679
We don't have to scheme.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:49.919
Sometimes in life, we feel like we have to step in and help God accomplish what God says

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:53.119
He's going to accomplish, right?

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:59.659
And the reality is that God's given us responsibility, and He's given us duty, and as He's given

00:34:59.659 --> 00:35:04.119
us duty and responsibility, that's what we need to focus on, and we need to be focused

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:09.559
upon our duty and our responsibility, but we do not have to try to help God accomplish

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:14.839
His purpose, for God's purposes will be accomplished.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:21.119
And as I look at this passage of Scripture, I believe that Jacob is scheming here, and

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:25.119
the reality is that if we're living by faith, if we're doing what God's told us to do and

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:29.439
we're focused on the duties and we're focused upon the responsibilities, I don't need to

00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:34.479
scheme in order to get the blessing.

00:35:34.479 --> 00:35:39.879
I'm not sure, as you look at the passage of Scripture, how much Jacob knew all that was

00:35:39.879 --> 00:35:44.439
going on, but you think about this passage and think about what's going on, and for him

00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:50.039
to say, sell me this day thy birthright, it was as if he had heard what his mother had

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:54.559
said with regard to the elder shall serve the younger in all that was contained there

00:35:54.559 --> 00:36:00.199
in that verse of Scripture, in that revelation that God had given to Rebekah, that now you

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:08.519
come to the place that Jacob is saying, now's my opportunity, and the opportunity has presented

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:15.639
itself and I'm going to step in and I'm going to help accomplish this purpose.

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:21.799
And I find this evening that God doesn't need our help.

00:36:21.799 --> 00:36:24.879
Let me explain that a little bit further.

00:36:24.879 --> 00:36:34.079
The reality, again, is that we do have responsibilities and have duties, but God is going to fulfill

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:37.639
His purpose and His plan.

00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:42.959
And there are many times when we look at the Scriptures and we look at other historical

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:49.079
figures and even look at our own lives, that perhaps we would try to scheme and devise

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:54.439
a plan and try to manipulate circumstances in order to accomplish something.

00:36:54.439 --> 00:36:59.199
But the reality is that we need to just rest in God and allow God to do what only God can

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:00.599
do.

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:06.019
And when we do that, when we follow that process, we do not have to take the same course of

00:37:06.019 --> 00:37:13.179
action that Jacob will take in chapter number 27, and you understand all that he dealt with.

00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:16.859
And listen, there's some great things about Jacob that we'll study over the next several

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:21.879
chapters and some really insightful things that I believe are helpful for us, but the

00:37:21.879 --> 00:37:28.599
reality is that Jacob had to learn some lessons, and I feel that here is the start, as God

00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:34.819
has revealed it to us, of some of these problems that he's going to deal with.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:40.139
And this evening, when we remember that God is God and that He is in control and that

00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:46.519
Jacob in this situation, he was going to receive the blessing, he was going to be the recipient,

00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:51.339
though the culture may have had some other idea and the birthright, the blessing, and

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:57.459
so on and so forth, God had made it clear and God would see to it.

00:37:57.459 --> 00:38:01.539
And for us this evening, as we look at a passage of Scripture like this, we understand historically

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:02.779
what happens.

00:38:02.779 --> 00:38:08.019
We see the difference, and it's a distinct difference, a contrast between Esau and Jacob,

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:12.659
and we see the dysfunction in the family, and we're sad to report that it continues

00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:19.079
even to this very day in many families around our nation that are so dysfunctional.

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:24.139
But we find that as we look at the despised birthright, that yes, we can look at Esau,

00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:31.339
and we can look at Esau compromising and forfeiting the future for the immediate and so on and

00:38:31.419 --> 00:38:37.179
so forth, and there's various applications and beneficial applications to that truth

00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:40.419
and to understanding that.

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:44.779
But I find that oftentimes we can skip right over Jacob in this passage of Scripture and

00:38:44.779 --> 00:38:51.419
fail to recognize how Jacob was scheming, and he really didn't have to.

00:38:51.419 --> 00:38:56.339
And I hope tonight that as we briefly look at this passage of Scripture that we would

00:38:56.339 --> 00:39:01.459
resolve in our hearts and our minds that we're going to walk in the Spirit so that

00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:06.339
we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, as we note the situation there with Esau and

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:12.939
note that he's a profane person and that the flesh and the spirit, the elder and the

00:39:12.939 --> 00:39:17.539
younger, and we mentioned all of this in our last message, the reality is that the old

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:24.019
man is always going to be older than the new man, because you got saved at some point after

00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:25.159
you were born.

00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:29.719
You can't get saved if you've not been born, if you don't understand the truth of the gospel,

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:33.919
and so when we look at that truth, spiritual application, we must understand, listen, there

00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:39.559
are times in which we can operate in the flesh and we can mind fleshly things, and we can

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:45.319
sacrifice the immediate, the temporal, or sacrifice the future, the eternal for the

00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:52.199
immediate, for that which is needed right now, the fleshly things.

00:39:52.199 --> 00:39:57.239
But I also want you to take a lesson from Jacob and say, I don't need the scheme.

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:59.639
I can just trust God.

00:39:59.639 --> 00:39:59.999
I can just...

00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:04.999
Please trust God that He has a plan, and that He's going to see it through.

00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:06.519
There are times in which we scheme.

00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:10.079
Listen, in the very next text of Scripture we're going to read about Isaac scheming

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:15.239
with Rebekah and Abimelech and all that takes place, and he follows the same thing that

00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:17.839
Abraham did.

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:24.799
I said to you on two occasions already as we studied Abraham, with Sarah, she's my sister,

00:40:24.799 --> 00:40:29.959
I said it with regard to Pharaoh, and I said it with regard to Abimelech, I believe with

00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:36.119
all of my heart that Abraham could have gone into both situations saying, she's my wife,

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:37.999
and God would have taken care of him.

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:43.279
I believe that with all my heart, because God is able.

00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:44.279
But what was Abraham doing?

00:40:44.279 --> 00:40:45.279
He was afraid.

00:40:45.279 --> 00:40:50.559
Man, they're going to see how beautiful my wife is, and they're going to kill me for

00:40:50.559 --> 00:40:56.779
her, and so let me say that she's my sister.

00:40:56.779 --> 00:40:58.359
And God worked, did He not?

00:40:58.799 --> 00:41:02.559
And He worked miraculously in both of those events, and He's going to do the same thing

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:05.359
in the next chapter, in chapter 26.

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:08.959
And what happens sometimes is we can get into this routine of scheming and manipulating and

00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:16.119
trying to, but the reality is that we can just live resting and knowing that we fulfill

00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:23.279
our duties and our responsibilities and that God is able to do what only God can do.

00:41:23.279 --> 00:41:25.559
I don't need to scheme.

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:26.559
I don't need to manipulate.

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:31.359
I'm going to drive myself crazy, and you're going to drive yourself crazy if we try to

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:33.079
scheme and manipulate.

00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:37.999
We just simply keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ and do what we're supposed to do and

00:41:37.999 --> 00:41:40.119
trust Him for the results.

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:41.279
Amen?

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:46.079
And we find that here, yes, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob.

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:50.879
We'll see some of the significance of that in the next several chapters, and really the

00:41:50.879 --> 00:41:56.439
significance of that historically as things go forward for the nation of Israel and their

00:41:56.439 --> 00:42:00.919
conflicts that take place with Edom over the centuries.

00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:05.839
But this evening, let's take these takeaways from this passage of Scripture and determine

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:10.799
that we're going to apply truth and entrust God.

00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:12.519
I don't need to scheme.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:13.519
Stop it.

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:17.039
If I'm scheming, if I'm trying to manipulate, I can just stop and rest in God.

00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:19.279
I'll finish with this story.

00:42:19.279 --> 00:42:25.599
It's a personal testimony, and it was kind of interesting when you think about the plan

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:30.579
that God has and God having a plan for your life, and you trust Him and you believe Him.

00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:35.039
And I believe that God is sovereign and that God is able.

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:38.839
And I remember when I believed that it was, and some of you have heard this story before.

00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:42.559
I'll just say, I'll give you the brief version this evening.

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:46.439
But when we believed, Holly and I believed that it was time for us to go full-time in

00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:53.279
ministry, there were several conversations that I had with some mentors and with some

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:57.199
counselors and what have you, and received counsel.

00:42:57.199 --> 00:43:01.399
And the counsel that I got that was consistent across the board was, you just stay doing

00:43:01.399 --> 00:43:07.239
what you're doing, serving God, being faithful, and God will work it out.

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:11.899
God knows where you are, and God knows where you need to be.

00:43:11.899 --> 00:43:16.119
Just keep serving God, and you just wait on the Lord.

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:22.839
For the next probably nine months, that's what we did.

00:43:22.839 --> 00:43:28.839
You know how many times I wanted to put my hand into the situation?

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.919
Seriously.

00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:33.279
I could help God.

00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:34.799
Now understand how I'm saying that.

00:43:34.799 --> 00:43:40.719
I'm not saying that irreverently, but sometimes we think that way, right?

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:45.239
I can help God by finding the place where I'm supposed to go.

00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:50.199
And if I start kind of making some calls, and if I start sending out some resumes, if

00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:56.999
I start going some places and preaching, then I can kind of, right?

00:43:56.999 --> 00:43:57.999
I didn't.

00:43:57.999 --> 00:44:00.279
I wanted to.

00:44:00.279 --> 00:44:02.559
I really wanted to at times.

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:08.519
Not because I was trying to run from anything, but because I really wanted to be in the ministry.

00:44:08.519 --> 00:44:11.239
And we just waited on God.

00:44:11.239 --> 00:44:13.259
Just waited on God.

00:44:13.259 --> 00:44:18.559
And we'd hear about this church that needed a pastor, and, oh man, it was so hard not

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:23.159
to go talk to the people and find out some information and let them know that we were

00:44:23.159 --> 00:44:25.959
looking to pastor a church, but just didn't.

00:44:25.959 --> 00:44:27.479
Just waited on God.

00:44:27.479 --> 00:44:33.119
And about nine months after that whole process happened is when I heard about a church in

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.119
Oakton, Virginia.

00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:38.199
And many of you know all of the details, and I won't take the time this evening to talk

00:44:38.879 --> 00:44:39.879
about it.

00:44:39.879 --> 00:44:49.919
But it's just absolutely amazing to see how God worked it all out without my help.

00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:50.999
And let me say this.

00:44:50.999 --> 00:44:52.439
I believe this.

00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:56.879
I could be wrong, but I believe this.

00:44:56.879 --> 00:45:02.719
If I would have done what I wanted to do, I never would have come here to be the pastor.

00:45:02.719 --> 00:45:03.719
You know why?

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:06.159
I would have ended up somewhere else before this door ever opened.

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:10.279
You know how many churches there are in America that don't have pastors?

00:45:10.279 --> 00:45:11.279
Lots.

00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:15.319
A lot.

00:45:15.319 --> 00:45:16.959
You can find your place.

00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:18.999
You can get in somewhere.

00:45:18.999 --> 00:45:20.599
But is it where God wants you?

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:21.599
Right?

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:23.999
You understand what I'm saying?

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:28.439
And I believe with all my heart that if I would have done at times what I felt like

00:45:28.439 --> 00:45:33.699
doing, we never would have come here.

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:35.339
Not because I didn't want to come here.

00:45:35.339 --> 00:45:37.059
Don't misunderstand.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:41.099
I would have ended up being somewhere else already.

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:48.779
And when that phone call went from the previous pastor to Evangelist Mershon, and he said,

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:52.899
do you know a young pastor or a young preacher that you could recommend?

00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:57.299
I wouldn't even have been on his radar because I was already a pastor in another church.

00:45:57.299 --> 00:45:59.219
Does it make sense?

00:45:59.219 --> 00:46:04.819
And so at times in our lives, listen, the temptation is there to think that we can help

00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:11.539
God scheme and devise and manipulate and whatever.

00:46:11.539 --> 00:46:19.999
And it takes, it's hard, it's not easy to just wait on God and let God work it all out.

00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:25.219
And when you do, you see that God is able to do what only God can do.

00:46:25.219 --> 00:46:29.659
And I'll say this to close the story.

00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:34.739
It's exciting to me that when you see God work all of those details out, that you can

00:46:34.739 --> 00:46:42.859
have a great peace in knowing that you're exactly where God wants you to be.

00:46:42.859 --> 00:46:47.659
How many times we could force our way into something and then face trouble and problems

00:46:47.659 --> 00:46:50.579
and say, man, maybe this wasn't the right place I was supposed to be.

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:54.939
I kind of manipulated some circumstances and I kind of whatever, and man, it turned out

00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:56.659
to be a mess.

00:46:56.659 --> 00:46:57.659
And that's because I'm at the wrong place.

00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:05.259
When you just let God, you can have a great peace that I'm where God wants me to be.

00:47:05.259 --> 00:47:06.259
Amen?

00:47:06.259 --> 00:47:08.219
And so let's learn that lesson from Jacob tonight.

00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:09.539
Father, we love You.

00:47:09.539 --> 00:47:11.859
We thank You for loving us.

00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:13.979
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:47:13.979 --> 00:47:17.459
And as we look at this passage, we understand the significance of the birthright.

00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:20.779
We understand the blessing that's associated with it.

00:47:20.779 --> 00:47:23.179
We understand that Esau sold his birthright.

00:47:23.179 --> 00:47:27.379
He despised his birthright.

00:47:27.379 --> 00:47:36.499
We know the implications of this passage of Scripture on future accounts that we'll read.

00:47:36.499 --> 00:47:45.259
I pray that You'd help us not to mind earthly things and fleshly things as Esau did.

00:47:45.259 --> 00:47:54.459
But Lord, I pray that also You'd help us with this application with regard to Jacob.

00:47:54.459 --> 00:47:59.099
And God, we'd just rest in Thee.

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:00.939
Allow You to do what only You can do.

00:48:00.939 --> 00:48:07.139
Help us to focus on our duties and our responsibilities and being faithful to fulfill those things

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:14.179
that You've called us to do, and then just simply rest in You.

00:48:14.179 --> 00:48:20.659
Not feeling as if we have to scheme or manipulate, but that we can simply trust You and see You

00:48:20.659 --> 00:48:21.659
work.

00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:27.099
Father, I pray that You would bless our time of invitation.

00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:32.799
Perhaps You've taken this evening and spoken to someone specifically from this portion

00:48:32.799 --> 00:48:36.899
of Scripture, whether it's through something that I've said or something the Holy Spirit

00:48:36.899 --> 00:48:37.899
spoke to them about.

00:48:37.899 --> 00:48:42.259
Lord, I pray that we'd be responsive and that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers

00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:44.419
only.

00:48:44.419 --> 00:48:47.739
Work as only You can, and we'll give You the glory for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:48.379
Would You stand with me?
