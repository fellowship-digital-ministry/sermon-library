1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
of Psalms will be in Psalm 23.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,739
And if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin,

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:07,639
you'll see that we're doing part one and part two

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,340
for this morning and this evening.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,840
And looking at this very familiar Psalm,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,040
of course, Psalm 23 is probably just as familiar

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,780
as the song that we just sang, Amazing Grace.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,920
In fact, I've been to a number of funerals over my life

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,260
where even not being a church funeral

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,700
like what we would have here,

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,939
many times people still will use that song, Amazing Grace,

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,900
and still reference Psalm 23.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,599
It's very familiar to us.

14
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,860
But I hope this morning that even though

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,380
this is a familiar Psalm,

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,540
that God would help us to be attentive

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,340
and really get a truth that God has for us.

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,459
The Bible says this beginning in verse number one.

19
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:50,819
I'm not gonna preach through the whole Psalm,

20
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,819
but I wanna read the entire Psalm

21
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,619
at the beginning of the message this morning.

22
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,459
The Bible says,

23
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,919
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

24
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,659
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

25
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,599
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

26
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,540
He restoreth my soul.

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,699
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness

28
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:11,400
for his namesake.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,300
Yea, though I walk through the valley

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,180
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,839
for thou art with me.

32
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,120
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,980
Thou preparest a table before me

34
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,239
in the presence of mine enemies.

35
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,879
Thou anointest my head with oil,

36
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,580
my cup runneth over.

37
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,980
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,459
all the days of my life,

39
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:41,019
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

40
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,160
The song that we just sang in this Psalm

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,739
goes so well together.

42
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,940
I didn't pick the songs, Dean always does,

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,699
but it's always a blessing to me.

44
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,199
And you have those weeks when they just

45
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,639
go together so well.

46
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,900
And this morning as we look at this particular Psalm,

47
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,099
again a very familiar Psalm,

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,599
it's full of powerful truth

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,239
and really not part of the message,

50
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,940
but certainly important to deal with.

51
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,419
Notice in the very beginning of this Psalm

52
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,180
that the psalmist, the human penman

53
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,820
that God used to write the Psalm is David.

54
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And the Bible says, the Lord is my shepherd.

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,160
And I want you to just think about that truth

56
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,660
just for a moment this morning.

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,259
He is the shepherd, he's the good shepherd,

58
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,520
he's the great shepherd, he's the chief shepherd.

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,479
But notice that David says, the Lord is my shepherd.

60
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,399
And that possessive truth that we find

61
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,119
in this particular Psalm,

62
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,039
he says the Lord is my shepherd.

63
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,559
And I wonder this morning,

64
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,759
how many of us could say,

65
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hands,

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,119
but how many of us could say this morning with David

67
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,399
that the Lord is my shepherd?

68
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,679
Not just that he is the shepherd

69
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,759
or the good shepherd and so on and so forth,

70
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,880
but the Lord is my shepherd.

71
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,899
I would say to you this morning,

72
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,160
there's only one way for the Lord to be your shepherd.

73
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,520
And that's through accepting him

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,479
as your personal Lord and savior.

75
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,679
In John chapter number 10,

76
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,360
and we'll actually look at some of those verses

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,399
this morning, the Bible teaches us

78
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,600
in that portion of scripture

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,199
that Jesus is the good shepherd.

80
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,679
And the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.

81
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,600
And he says this in verse number 27,

82
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,919
as you go through the end of that chapter,

83
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,360
he says this, my sheep hear my voice

84
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,059
and I know them and I give unto them eternal life

85
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,660
and they shall never perish.

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,699
And so it's interesting as you compare

87
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,419
those two portions of scripture

88
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,419
that here, David says the Lord is my shepherd.

89
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,339
There, Jesus says, my sheep hear my voice.

90
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,580
And this morning, I hope that you have assurance

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,059
that Jesus is your shepherd,

92
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,979
that the Lord is your shepherd.

93
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:43,940
We'll deal with a few things

94
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,740
as we get into the message this morning.

95
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,820
And if you're not sure of that, man,

96
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,160
we'd love today for you to have that level of confidence.

97
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,699
But I want you to see as we look at this psalm

98
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,240
at the bookends by way of introduction,

99
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,199
the last statement of this psalm in verse number six says,

100
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,199
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

101
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,820
And I want you to understand there is a great connection

102
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,679
between verse number one and verse number six.

103
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,600
The truth of verse number one,

104
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,919
the Lord is my shepherd is the basis

105
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,820
for the truth in verse number six,

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,019
that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

107
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,779
You cannot this morning say that I will dwell

108
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,859
in the house of the Lord forever

109
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:29,140
if you do not know the Lord as your shepherd.

110
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,420
And we find that there's a great connection

111
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
between verse one and verse six

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,279
and so many wonderful truths that are packed in between.

113
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,940
But I'm thankful this morning

114
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,880
that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

115
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,019
because the Lord is my shepherd.

116
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,739
We think about this even the terminology.

117
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:48,980
Someone sent me a text this week

118
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,339
and it was kind of interesting the way

119
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,739
that the text kind of worked even with this thought here

120
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:53,899
from verse number six.

121
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,779
Notice it's the house of who?

122
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,260
It's the house of the Lord.

123
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,700
The Lord is there.

124
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,140
And that's what makes heaven heaven

125
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,220
is the fact that Jesus is there.

126
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,339
And what a tremendous blessing.

127
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,220
But we think about this particular psalm

128
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,420
and so many rich truths that are contained within this psalm.

129
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,519
But I really wanna focus our attention this day,

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,839
this morning and this evening

131
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,920
on that last phrase in verse number five

132
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,899
where the psalmist says, my cup runneth over.

133
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,640
My cup runneth over.

134
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,200
The imagery of this statement is beautiful.

135
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,040
No doubt in your mind and in mine

136
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,119
when you read that statement, my cup runneth over,

137
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,600
you think about the abundance,

138
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,959
you think about the extra, if you will,

139
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,119
and you find that this imagery

140
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,959
of this single statement of God's word,

141
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,079
it reveals to us the goodness of God

142
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,059
in the lives of His children.

143
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:46,100
And certainly this morning,

144
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,160
I believe that every one of us would agree

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,640
that God has been abundantly good to us,

146
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,399
that God has blessed us beyond measure,

147
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,399
that even as I prayed this morning,

148
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,880
as the psalmist says, that the Lord hath daily,

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,959
He's daily loadeth me with benefits.

150
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,239
It's not just He's sprinkled them upon us,

151
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,320
no, He's loaded us with benefits.

152
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,559
And what a blessing.

153
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm sure at some point in your life,

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,779
I've heard it often in my life

155
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,799
that you've heard somebody speaking about the idea

156
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:20,200
of whether an individual is an optimist or a pessimist.

157
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,799
How many have heard people talk about this before?

158
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,359
And oftentimes what they'll use

159
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:27,040
is they'll use a metaphor of a cup of water.

160
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,600
And in using that metaphor,

161
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,320
they'll say, are you a half full

162
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,839
or half empty kind of a person?

163
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,079
You've heard that before.

164
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,720
And they use that terminology,

165
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,600
they use that metaphor in order to try to help us determine

166
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,880
are you an optimist or a pessimist?

167
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,679
And we've heard that and people have used that,

168
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,600
but I would submit to you this morning

169
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
that as a child of the King,

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm thankful this morning that my cup's not half full,

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,920
my cup's not half empty, my cup runneth over.

172
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
My cup runneth over.

173
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,880
And this morning, as we see the psalmist boldly declaring

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,260
and making the statement as our minds are fixed this week

175
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,459
on the subject of Thanksgiving and we have this holiday,

176
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,980
listen, it's not just that we'd sit around

177
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,579
and fill ourselves with all of these particular items

178
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,579
that find themselves on the menu of Thanksgiving.

179
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,220
It's not that we'd sit around and just watch football

180
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,459
or have family time and that sort of thing.

181
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,220
No, we must recognize the giver of all good gifts.

182
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,579
And surely each of us this morning

183
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,820
should be able to say my cup runneth over.

184
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,059
My cup runneth over.

185
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,519
This morning and this evening,

186
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,420
I want to provide for you 10 reasons,

187
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,859
10 biblical reasons that every child of God

188
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:47,459
should say my cup runneth over.

189
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,299
My cup runneth over.

190
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:51,779
Number one, if you're taking notes, my shepherd loves me.

191
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,579
My shepherd loves me.

192
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,859
I hope that you never get over that.

193
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,420
I sang this morning, one of the songs

194
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,700
that we sang in Sunday school this morning

195
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
was Jesus loves me.

196
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,779
What a precious, precious truth of God's word.

197
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,459
The songwriter of that particular song

198
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,220
said Jesus loves me, this I know.

199
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,660
It's not a hope so, it's not a think so,

200
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,920
it's not I hope Jesus, no, I know that Jesus loves me.

201
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
Why?

202
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,019
For the Bible tells me so.

203
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,140
And I'm so thankful that God and his word

204
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,859
has declared to us his love for us

205
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,440
and he's revealed to us his love for us.

206
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,859
And we find this morning that our shepherd,

207
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,219
my shepherd, my shepherd loves me.

208
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,919
Nothing can separate me from the love of God,

209
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,020
which is in Christ Jesus.

210
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,940
Look at a few verses of scripture with me

211
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,580
and have your hands ready this morning.

212
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,820
We'll look at a number of scriptures this morning.

213
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,760
But notice in John chapter number three,

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,380
and I want you to read it this morning.

215
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,539
For so many of us this morning, we could quote John 3.16.

216
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,979
It's a very familiar verse of scripture.

217
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,859
But I want you to read it this morning and look at it.

218
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:59,140
I want you to allow the Lord to use the word of God

219
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,099
to impress upon your heart and to encourage you this morning

220
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:06,960
with this truth that God loves you.

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,099
You know, there's some folks in our world today

222
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,500
that they feel like they're not loved.

223
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,400
They feel like no one loves me, no one cares about me,

224
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,239
no one knows.

225
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,719
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

226
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,580
that no matter what's going on in your life,

227
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,659
no matter what trial you're facing,

228
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,739
no matter what hardship we're enduring,

229
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,020
that we can rejoice and we can say my cup runneth over.

230
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,859
Listen, just if this was the only point today,

231
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,780
my cup runneth over because God loves me.

232
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,859
That's enough, but there's so much more.

233
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,419
The 10 reasons that I'm gonna give you

234
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,940
between this morning and this evening, it's not exhaustive.

235
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,619
We could go on and on and on.

236
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,140
But this morning, look at John 3.

237
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,260
The Bible says this in verse number 16.

238
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,260
For God so loved the world

239
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,020
that he gave his only begotten Son

240
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,020
that whosoever believeth in him shall not die.

241
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,320
who believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

242
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
Notice verse 17,

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world,

244
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
but that the world through him might be saved.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,840
You know, we were condemned already.

246
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,500
But I'm thankful this morning because the Lord is my shepherd

247
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,080
and because my shepherd loves me that I no longer,

248
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,880
there's no condemnation for those who believe

249
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,440
and praise the Lord for that wonderful truth.

250
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,640
And we find here this morning that the Bible says,

251
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,180
For God so loved the world.

252
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,940
And someone says, well, you don't understand what I've done.

253
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,180
God does, and he still says that he loves you.

254
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,820
Praise God for that.

255
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,460
Because at times, if we'd be honest,

256
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,520
we're not very lovable.

257
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,680
Amen.

258
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,200
But God loves you and he loves me.

259
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
My shepherd loves me.

260
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,820
Romans five and verse number eight,

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,520
a verse that's very familiar to us.

262
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,400
And the Bible says there that God commended his love toward us.

263
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,260
And that while we were yet sinners,

264
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
Christ died for us.

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,160
And I think about the demonstration of God's love.

266
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
He declared it, but he demonstrated it.

267
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,140
And he said, I loved you so much that I died for you,

268
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,340
that I took your place.

269
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,300
And we find that that was his demonstration of his love.

270
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,180
But I want you to look at Romans eight.

271
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,980
And it's the passage that a lot of times we'll go to

272
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
when we think about the love of Christ

273
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,620
and how thankful we ought to be this morning

274
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,980
that my shepherd loves me.

275
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
In Romans chapter number eight and verse number 35,

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,680
the question is asked,

277
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,520
who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

278
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,780
We'll read all the verses,

279
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,760
but I'm thankful this morning that the answer is nothing.

280
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,560
There's nothing that can separate you

281
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,820
from the love of Christ.

282
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,660
The Bible says,

283
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,260
shall tribulation or distress or persecution

284
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,440
or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,

285
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,160
as it is written, for thy sake,

286
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,980
we are killed all the day long.

287
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,420
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

288
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,100
Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.

289
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,420
Notice, through him that loved us.

290
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,740
Notice what the writer says, Paul, the human penman.

291
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,360
He says, I am persuaded.

292
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,900
I am persuaded of what?

293
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,540
That neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities

294
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,240
nor powers nor things present nor things to come

295
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,520
nor height, nor depth,

296
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,380
nor any other creature shall be able to separate us

297
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,720
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

298
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,020
I hope this morning that you would say my cup runneth over.

299
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,960
Why? Because my shepherd loves me.

300
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,560
My shepherd loves me.

301
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,260
There's some times in your life that the enemy might,

302
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,940
he's the accuser of the brethren, by the way.

303
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,160
He might whisper in your ear that God doesn't love you.

304
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,740
If he really loved you, he wouldn't, listen,

305
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,940
nothing can separate us from the love of God.

306
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,800
The songwriter said, this I know, Jesus loves me.

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
This I know.

308
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,940
Why? For the Bible tells me so.

309
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,440
He didn't say because my circumstances tell me so.

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,540
He didn't say because my feelings tell me so.

311
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,980
He said, because the Bible tells me so.

312
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,740
And our emotions and our feelings and our circumstances

313
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,380
do not dictate to us what is truth.

314
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,360
It is God's word that reveals to us what is truth.

315
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,660
And so number one this morning,

316
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,280
why would I say my cup runneth over?

317
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,720
Because my shepherd loves me.

318
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,140
Number two, not only because my shepherd loves me,

319
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,280
but my shepherd died for me.

320
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,820
My shepherd died for me.

321
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,160
It shows me the love of God,

322
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,080
but it also reveals to me as I think about the love of God,

323
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,460
demonstrate it through the fact

324
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,760
that the Lord Jesus Christ died for me.

325
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,560
It shows me the value that he's placed upon my life

326
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
and upon your life.

327
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,120
He loved you so much that he was willing to die for you.

328
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,920
You say, pastor, why did Jesus have to die?

329
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Well, because sin had to be paid for.

330
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,840
The Bible says that the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

331
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,680
And we find that the Bible tells us

332
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,400
that the wages of sin is death.

333
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,840
And we find this morning that all have sinned

334
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
and come short of the glory of God.

335
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Every single one of us that are sitting here this morning

336
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
have sinned.

337
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
We are guilty before a holy God.

338
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,920
Every one of us.

339
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
You say, well, I'm not as bad as,

340
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,540
I don't care if you're not as bad as, you're guilty.

341
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
And by the way, it's funny how we always try

342
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,840
to find somebody worse off than we are

343
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,240
to compare ourselves to,

344
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,120
when we wanna try to make ourselves feel like we're good.

345
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
But we're all guilty.

346
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
Some of us this morning,

347
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,560
we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, our savior,

348
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,640
so we are saved sinners.

349
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
Amen?

350
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,800
We are heaven-bound sinners.

351
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,520
But this morning, when we understand the truth

352
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,960
that Jesus died for me, my shepherd died for me,

353
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,080
we find in John chapter number 10,

354
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,840
and I want you to look in John 10.

355
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,560
It's a powerful passage of scripture.

356
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,780
In fact, between this morning and this evening,

357
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,320
we're gonna look at a number of verses

358
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,040
from John chapter number 10

359
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,680
and how the correlation, the connection

360
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,040
between Psalm 23 and John 10,

361
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,880
it's so obvious and so powerful.

362
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
And we find that here,

363
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,640
Jesus begins in verse number one of John 10,

364
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,280
and he says, verily, verily,

365
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,600
this is of a truth of a truth.

366
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,240
God's word is truth.

367
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Jesus Christ himself is truth.

368
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
And he says this, I say unto you,

369
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,880
he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold,

370
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,760
but climbeth up some other way,

371
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,440
the same as a thief and a robber,

372
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,960
but he that entereth in by the door

373
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,060
is the shepherd of the sheep.

374
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm thankful this morning the Lord is my shepherd.

375
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,760
And we mentioned that already,

376
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,160
but we find that as we look through

377
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,700
this portion of scripture,

378
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,120
that not only is Jesus going to declare to us

379
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,680
that he is the shepherd, that he is the door,

380
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,040
but you find that he's going to reveal to us

381
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,640
that as our shepherd, he took our place

382
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,920
and he died for us.

383
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,240
In verse three, to him, the porter openeth

384
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,520
and the sheep hear his voice

385
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,480
and he calleth his own sheep,

386
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,920
notice his own sheep by name,

387
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
and leadeth them out.

388
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
And when he put forth his own sheep,

389
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,900
he goeth before them and the sheep follow him,

390
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,000
for they know his voice.

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
And a stranger will they not follow,

392
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,520
but will flee from him,

393
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,500
for they know not the voice of a stranger's.

394
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,140
It says this, this parable spake Jesus unto them,

395
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,340
but they understood not what things they were

396
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,900
which he spake unto them.

397
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,020
And this happened often during the earthly ministry

398
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,140
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

399
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,900
He would teach and there would be some uncertainty

400
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,380
as to what is the meaning,

401
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,140
what is the message that he's seeking to teach us.

402
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,460
And so what does Jesus do?

403
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,020
Well, he gives more explanation.

404
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,060
And I'm thankful that he's a loving,

405
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,100
gracious, patient God.

406
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,180
And you go to God's word and there are times

407
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,400
in which we don't understand

408
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,880
and we can say, Lord, would you help me to understand?

409
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,520
And here, notice what Jesus says to them

410
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,920
after they understood not according to verse number six.

411
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
He says, verily, verily, I say unto you,

412
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,040
notice he makes it very plain,

413
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,540
I am the door of the sheep.

414
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,160
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers,

415
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,080
but the sheep did not hear them.

416
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,240
I am the door.

417
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,520
By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved

418
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,440
and shall go in and out and find pasture.

419
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,960
Notice the contrast in verse 10 for the thief,

420
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,000
cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy.

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,280
I am come that they might have life

422
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
and that they might have it more abundantly.

423
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,360
I am the good shepherd.

424
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,200
Notice what he says,

425
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,960
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

426
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,040
Why does my cup runneth over?

427
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,160
Because my shepherd died for me.

428
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
He died for me.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,720
I was guilty.

430
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,920
You were guilty.

431
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,460
We deserve death.

432
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,580
Not only do we deserve physical death,

433
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,620
but we deserve spiritual death.

434
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,700
And really, that's what's being spoken of

435
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,780
when the Bible says the wage of sin is death.

436
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,900
It's yes, death is the result,

437
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,460
physical death, the result of sin,

438
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,600
but the wage of sin is that second death,

439
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,300
that spiritual death.

440
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,180
And here, the Bible says that the good shepherd

441
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,060
giveth his life for the sheep.

442
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,260
He did for me and he did for you

443
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,220
what we could not do for ourselves.

444
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,100
And he died for us.

445
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,580
He took our place.

446
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,660
And we sing the song sometimes at Christmas time,

447
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,180
sometimes at Easter, about it was for me.

448
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,540
And it was for me that he went

449
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,380
and he went to that cross and he died an awful death.

450
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,940
And I'm so thankful that he didn't stay dead.

451
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,260
He went to a borrowed tomb

452
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,420
and he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

453
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,020
He's alive forevermore.

454
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,660
But we find this morning that my shepherd died for me.

455
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,739
Notice in verse number 15, it says this,

456
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,140
"'And the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father,

457
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,780
"'and I lay down my life for the sheep.'"

458
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,820
He says this, "'And other sheep I have,

459
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,900
"'which are not of this fold, them also I must bring,

460
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
"'and they shall hear my voice,

461
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,860
"'and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

462
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,140
"'Therefore doth my Father love me, why?

463
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,220
"'Because I lay down my life, then I might take it again.'"

464
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,420
Notice the powerful truth in verse 18.

465
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,020
"'No man taketh it from me.'"

466
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,340
He said, but then the Romans arrest him

467
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,500
and no man taketh it, he lays it down.

468
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,860
He went willingly to that cross.

469
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,580
He suffered all that he did willingly

470
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,940
so that you and I could be redeemed.

471
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,260
Notice this is in verse 18,

472
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,500
"'But I lay it down on myself.

473
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,619
"'I have power to lay it down

474
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,059
"'and I have power to take it again.

475
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:29,140
"'This commandment have I received of my Father.'"

476
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,380
If you were to look at the record of the crucifixion,

477
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,340
Pilate was so confused

478
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,739
when he heard that Jesus was dead already.

479
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:36,580
Why?

480
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,540
Because of the timing.

481
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,420
But remember, Jesus said it is finished

482
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,260
and he gave up the ghost is what the Bible tells us.

483
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,380
And he laid down his life for us.

484
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,820
He died for us because he loves us.

485
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,460
And we find this morning

486
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,660
that why should we live through life?

487
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,300
Why should we walk through life?

488
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,179
And echo the words of the psalmist

489
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,780
that my cup runneth over.

490
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,220
Listen, this idea of my cup is half full or half empty

491
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,179
is nonsense for the child of God.

492
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,979
we ought to be my cup runneth over kind of people

493
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:09,979
because my shepherd loves me and because my shepherd died for me.

494
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,479
He did for me what I could not do for myself.

495
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,479
I remember it was just over a year ago

496
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:18,979
that I stood in the very place there in Israel

497
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:22,179
where I had the opportunity, and I thank the Lord for it,

498
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,479
to be in the place where most likely Jesus,

499
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,479
when he was arrested and kept overnight

500
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:30,979
with the situation at Caiaphas' house and all that took place,

501
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,279
and to be able to see and to remember

502
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,279
being in the Garden of Gethsemane and all that took place

503
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,279
and thinking about all that my Savior endured for me

504
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,779
and going to the place Golgotha, the place of a skull,

505
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:49,279
and thinking about that place where my Savior died for me.

506
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,279
But then seeing there's an empty tomb

507
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,279
because he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

508
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,279
Listen, this morning, my faith is not based on being at that place.

509
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,579
My faith is in a person and in the truth of God's Word.

510
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,079
You may never have the opportunity on this side of eternity

511
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,579
to be able to be in Jerusalem and see those places personally,

512
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,079
but I tell you this morning that I'm so thankful

513
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,579
that God's given us the truth in his Word, that he died for us.

514
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,079
It is a settled fact of history.

515
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,079
It is a biblical truth that Jesus died for me.

516
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,579
Notice with me 1 Peter 3.

517
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:28,079
Notice this wonderful truth that God gives us

518
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,879
when it could impact you and me this morning to go through life.

519
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:36,879
Listen, my shepherd died for me.

520
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:43,879
In 1 Peter 3, in verse number 18,

521
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,879
the Bible says,

522
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:51,879
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins.

523
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,879
He suffered on that cross.

524
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,879
I want you to notice the emphasis that once suffered for sins.

525
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,679
This man, according to Hebrews chapter number 10,

526
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,679
made one sacrifice for sin forever.

527
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,679
Hallelujah.

528
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,679
And what a blessing.

529
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,679
He sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

530
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,679
But the Bible says, notice in verse 18,

531
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,679
The just for the unjust.

532
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,679
The just is Jesus.

533
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,679
The unjust is every other person that's ever walked upon the face of the earth.

534
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
The unjust.

535
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,679
He died for us.

536
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,679
The just for the unjust.

537
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,479
Why?

538
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:29,479
That he might bring us to God.

539
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,479
That he might bring us to God.

540
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:35,479
Being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit.

541
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,479
There are many other verses that we could look to this morning,

542
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,479
but I want to say to you from this verse of Scripture

543
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:43,479
that the only way that he could bring us to God

544
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,479
was through dying in our place.

545
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,479
It's the only way.

546
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,479
There's no other way that he could bring us to God.

547
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,479
He could not just arbitrarily decide that,

548
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,479
Oh yeah, I'm going to let all these people go to hell.

549
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,279
He had to die for us.

550
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,279
It was the only way for man to be reconciled

551
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,279
and we'll deal with that in just a few moments.

552
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,279
But notice with me a third reason.

553
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,279
Number one, my shepherd loves me.

554
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,279
Number two, my shepherd died for me.

555
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,279
Number three, my shepherd found me.

556
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,279
My shepherd found me.

557
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
You know, you've probably heard people use at times,

558
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,279
and I understand what they mean by it,

559
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,279
but they'll say something like this,

560
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,279
I found the Lord.

561
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,279
You've heard people say that, use that terminology.

562
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,279
And I believe truly the biblical record would reveal to us

563
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,279
that I really didn't find Jesus, he found me.

564
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,279
Amen?

565
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,279
The reality this morning is that we have a shepherd

566
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,279
that cares about us, a shepherd that loves us

567
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,279
and died for us and he found me.

568
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,279
I begin to think about my own life

569
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,279
and I begin to think about my childhood and my upbringing

570
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,279
and I begin to think about how the gospel was brought to me.

571
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,279
And maybe this morning you'd spend a few moments

572
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,279
and thinking in your own mind of how the gospel was brought to you.

573
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,279
Maybe the circumstances that led to you hearing the gospel for the first time.

574
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,279
Maybe it was somebody that God used at a workplace.

575
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,279
Maybe it was a neighbor.

576
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:04,279
Maybe it was a family member that introduced you to the Lord Jesus Christ.

577
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,279
I think about my children and my children have a different story than I have

578
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,279
because they were raised in a Christian home.

579
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,279
They were raised in a home where they heard the gospel from a young age.

580
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,279
They were raised in a home where we went to church from the day they were born

581
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,279
and they don't know anything different.

582
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,279
And some of you have that same testimony.

583
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,279
But some of us, we don't have that testimony.

584
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,279
I wasn't raised in church.

585
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
I didn't hear the gospel when I was a kid.

586
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,279
Someone said to me when I was about 12 years old,

587
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
do you want to go to heaven when you die?

588
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,279
And it's like, well, I mean, what's the alternative?

589
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,279
I don't want to go to hell.

590
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,279
Sure, I want to go to heaven.

591
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,279
But how was I going to get to heaven?

592
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,279
I had no idea how I was going to get to heaven.

593
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,279
I never understood why Jesus died.

594
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,279
I never knew that Jesus loved me.

595
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,279
But there was a man that shared the gospel with my dad.

596
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,279
He shared the testimony here before.

597
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:04,279
And because of that, I found out the truth of the gospel.

598
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,279
And in your life and in my life, I think about how Jesus found us.

599
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,279
The Bible tells us in Luke 19 in verse number 10,

600
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,279
and this description is wonderful

601
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,279
as we think about the truth that is found for us.

602
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,279
Of course, there's a parable about the,

603
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
as Jesus speaks to the folks there

604
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,279
and how the 99 and the shepherd would leave

605
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:27,279
to search for the one and so on and so forth.

606
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,279
But I find this morning that as I look at Luke 19

607
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,279
and I understand the account that is provided,

608
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,279
there's a man by the name of Zacchaeus in Luke 19.

609
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,279
And we're familiar with Zacchaeus.

610
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,279
Zacchaeus was a man that was not very well liked.

611
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,279
Let's put it that way.

612
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,279
And he was a man that was of little stature, the Bible tells us.

613
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,279
But he's a man that as we look at this text of Scripture,

614
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,279
he's a man that gets saved.

615
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,279
He has salvation.

616
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,279
But I want you to notice what Jesus says in Luke 19 in verse number 10.

617
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:06,279
For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

618
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,279
To seek and to save.

619
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,279
Why did Jesus pass through Jericho on this particular day?

620
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,279
Because there was a sinner that needed to be saved.

621
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,279
Why did Jesus say in John chapter number 4,

622
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,279
I must needs go through Samaria?

623
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,279
Because there was a woman that was going to be at the well

624
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,279
that needed to hear the truth of the gospel.

625
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
Jesus found me.

626
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,279
I'm so thankful that my shepherd found me this morning.

627
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,279
Can you imagine this morning?

628
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,279
It's hard for me to even wrap my mind around it.

629
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,279
Can you imagine being lost?

630
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,279
I mean, not knowing that if you were to die today that you'd go to heaven.

631
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,279
I'm not talking about hoping that you'd go to heaven.

632
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,279
I'm talking about knowing.

633
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,279
Because the Lord is my shepherd.

634
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,279
In verse number 6, I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

635
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,279
My shepherd, he loves me.

636
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,279
My shepherd died for me.

637
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,279
My shepherd found me.

638
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,279
He found me.

639
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,279
And he found you.

640
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,279
I don't know where he found you, but I know where he found me.

641
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,279
And I'm so thankful he found me.

642
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,279
Number 4 this morning, my shepherd cares for me.

643
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,279
It's amazing to me that he loves me.

644
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,279
He died for me.

645
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,279
He found me.

646
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,279
But then he cares about me.

647
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,279
I mean, he doesn't just leave me to my own resources.

648
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,279
He doesn't just leave me on my own.

649
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,279
No, he cares about every aspect of my life.

650
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,279
And he cares about you this morning.

651
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,279
We sing the song, no one ever cared for me like Jesus.

652
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,279
And I hope this morning that you can acknowledge that truth.

653
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,279
If you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

654
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
you'd say, my shepherd cares about me.

655
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,279
When it seems like no one else cares.

656
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,279
No doubt there's times in your life that you might feel like no one cares.

657
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,279
No one even knows.

658
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,279
No one understands.

659
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,279
I would tell you this morning that Jesus cares.

660
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,279
I know he cares.

661
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
That's what the songwriter says.

662
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,279
I know he cares.

663
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,279
The question is asked, it's a different song.

664
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,279
I spoke about no one ever cared for me like Jesus, but there's another.

665
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
Does Jesus care?

666
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
Yes, he cares.

667
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
I know he cares.

668
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,279
Why do I know he cares?

669
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,279
Because he's told me in his word again.

670
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,279
And that's a wonderful truth.

671
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,279
Remember, it's not based on your feelings.

672
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,279
It's not based on your emotions.

673
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,279
It's not based on your circumstances.

674
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,279
It's based on truth that God has given us in his word.

675
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,279
And this morning, I know that my shepherd cares for me.

676
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,279
Notice in 1 Peter 5, again, familiar verses of scripture.

677
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,279
But I hope this morning that when we consider these 10 truths,

678
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,279
and we'll look at 5 here this morning, and we'll look at 5 this evening.

679
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,279
But I hope this morning when you consider these things,

680
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,279
that you would walk through your life and say, man, my cup, surely, it runs over.

681
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
My cup runneth over.

682
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,279
God has been so good to me.

683
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,279
Listen, sometimes as God's people, we can complain with the best of them.

684
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,279
Amen?

685
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,279
We can go through life complaining and murmuring just like a lost person would.

686
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,279
In fact, there are times that some lost people might be more thankful than some of God's people.

687
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,279
Amen?

688
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,279
I know no one wants to admit that, but it's true.

689
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,279
But my cup runneth over.

690
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,279
It's perspective.

691
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,279
It's perspective.

692
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,279
Notice in 1 Peter 5, in verse number 7, the Bible says,

693
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:36,279
casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.

694
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,279
He didn't say cast some of your care on him.

695
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,279
He didn't say cast most of your care on him.

696
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,279
He said casting all.

697
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,279
Listen, he can handle it.

698
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,279
You can't.

699
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,279
He can handle it.

700
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,279
You can't.

701
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,279
I can't handle it, but God can.

702
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,279
You know, it's an amazing thing that we can take it to Jesus.

703
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,279
Tell it to Jesus.

704
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,279
We can just take it.

705
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,659
it and tell it to him. We can cast our care upon him. You know, sometimes when we think

706
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:13,939
about that truth of leave your burden, like, you know, leave it there, imagery sometimes

707
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:18,339
in our minds would go to an old-fashioned altar and we pour our heart before God and

708
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:22,219
pour out, cast our burden upon him. But sometimes we get up from praying and we take it right

709
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:31,299
back with us. It's hard as human beings, our minds, it's hard. But he says, casting all

710
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:35,819
your care upon him. I hope you can see the imagery of that idea of casting something

711
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:41,779
down. I mean, I'm putting this at the feet of Jesus because he cares for me. He cares

712
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:47,099
for me. Notice in verse number, in Psalm 55, turn over if you will to Psalm 55, a sister

713
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,299
verse here to what we see in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 7. And thinking about this truth

714
00:30:52,299 --> 00:31:00,979
this morning that Jesus, my shepherd, he cares for me. This morning he cares for you. He

715
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:12,739
cares for you. In Psalm 55, in verse number 22, the Bible says, cast thy burden upon

716
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:19,459
the Lord. Casting all your care upon him, we read in 1 Peter 5, 7, why? For he careth

717
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:27,459
for you. Here we find in Psalm 55 and verse 22, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he

718
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:34,819
shall sustain thee. He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. Now let me think

719
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:38,659
about, let's look at this verse a moment. He didn't say, cast thy burden upon the Lord

720
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:44,979
and he might sustain thee. He didn't even say, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he

721
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:52,859
can sustain thee. Right? Listen, I'm thankful that he can, but if the verse just said that

722
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:59,179
he can, it wouldn't carry as much weight. Do you agree? Because certainly some people

723
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:05,379
can do some things, but it doesn't mean they're going to. Amen? People that can do some things,

724
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:13,499
but they don't do it. Here the Bible says, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he shall

725
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:22,059
sustain thee. You say, I just can't go anymore. Have you cast your burden upon the Lord? Because

726
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:28,419
the Bible says he shall sustain thee. Amen? I'm not seeking to be lacking any kind of

727
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:32,459
comfort or being compassionate, but I'm simply saying this morning that are we going to take

728
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:41,379
God at his word? Because God said in his word that he shall sustain us. He's the sustainer.

729
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:45,259
I'm thankful he's the giver of life, but he's the sustainer. Remember what he said in John

730
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:51,959
10? I've come to give them a life that they might have it more abundantly. Notice the

731
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:58,279
rest of the verse in verse 22. He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. I'm thankful

732
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,119
that he'll sustain us. Sometimes part of the problem is that we're not doing the first

733
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:10,119
part of the verse. We're not casting our burden upon the Lord. We're not receiving that sustaining

734
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,179
power of God. We're not receiving what we could receive. Why? Because we're keeping

735
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,999
the burden ourselves. We're keeping the cares to ourselves, but God says, no, I want you

736
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:24,079
to know how much I care about you. I want you to know that you can cast your care upon

737
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,079
the Lord. Listen, this morning I'm thankful that I'm saved. I'm thankful that I'm heaven

738
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,599
bound, but I will say to you this morning that the moment that you got saved, all of

739
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:38,439
your cares did not just disappear. All of your problems did not cease. Your life did

740
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:46,359
not become perfect on this earth. Am I right? So isn't it good to know the Lord that sustains

741
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:52,439
you, that says cast your burden, that says cast your care? This morning, if you're not

742
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:56,639
sure of heaven, you've never trusted Christ as your savior. The reality is that when you

743
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,439
trust Christ, it doesn't mean he's going to fix all your problems immediately and everything

744
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:04,879
is just going to be, somebody said it this way, a bed of roses. I remember hearing that

745
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:08,439
many years ago and I said, well, you know that roses have thorns, right? And I don't

746
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:12,759
know that I want to be in a bed of roses anyway, amen? But I understand the imagery. I understand

747
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,839
the metaphor, the reason that they would use that statement. But this morning, listen,

748
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,559
understand that I'm thankful that I have someone that I know personally, the Lord is my shepherd

749
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,739
and I can cast my care upon him. I can cast my burden upon him. Why? Because he's my shepherd.

750
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,199
Because he's my God. He's my savior. And he's your savior. Is my life going to be problem

751
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,599
free? No. Listen, if somebody ever tells you that, they're lying to you. If someone tells

752
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,679
you that you trust Christ and your life's going to be problem free, they are lying to

753
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:53,679
you. Amen? One day, absolutely. When this mortal shall put off immortality or should

754
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,199
put on immortality, this corruption should put on incorruption, 1 Corinthians 15. Oh

755
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:06,359
yeah, at that time, I'm going to have no more problems. But until then, our lives are going

756
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,839
to have difficulties. But I know the shepherd, the Lord is my shepherd and I can cast my

757
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:20,079
burden. I can cast all my care upon him. Why? Because my shepherd cares about me. This morning,

758
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,439
my cup runneth over. My cup runneth over. Number five this morning, my shepherd provides

759
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:31,519
for me. My shepherd provides for me. You know, there's something interesting about sheep.

760
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:38,799
Turn back to Psalm 23, if you will. There's something interesting about sheep. Sheep are

761
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:53,759
really kind of helpless animals. They really are. They're defenseless. Sheep need a shepherd.

762
00:35:53,759 --> 00:36:00,479
There's an enemy. We can read about the natural predators to sheep and you can see in the

763
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:09,119
scriptures even some of the examples that God gives us. But we have an enemy, Satan,

764
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,039
the devil. The Bible says that he walketh about seeking whom he may devour. And I'm

765
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,759
thankful that my God, my shepherd, he provides for me. He provides protection for me. He

766
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:27,119
provides everything that I need. And I think about the sheep as they are such needy animals.

767
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,759
And the shepherd, the shepherd provides for them. And here in Psalm 23 and verse number

768
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:41,159
1, the Bible says, the Lord is my shepherd. Notice the next words, I shall not want. I

769
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:50,079
shall not want. It's amazing how a shepherd, a good shepherd, takes care of his sheep.

770
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,559
Our God is a good shepherd. The Lord is the good shepherd. He's been good to us and he

771
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,159
provides for us. The Bible says in verse number 2 of Psalm 23, he maketh me to lie

772
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,959
down in green pastures. Listen, I'm thankful for the, again, the imagery that we see here

773
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:13,119
in this 23rd Psalm. He didn't just say in pastures, he said in green pastures. Representing

774
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,159
to us and understanding to us the sustenance and the nourishment that the sheep would receive.

775
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:23,319
Why? Because it's a green pasture. Notice it says this, he leadeth me beside what? The

776
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:30,079
still waters. Why the still waters? Because sheep can't drink from rushing waters. They

777
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,919
can't. They need still waters. This morning, we see how the shepherd provides. We see how

778
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:41,359
my shepherd provides for me. But I would submit to you this morning that as we look at this

779
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,799
phrase or these words of Scripture in Psalm 23 and where our mind is rushing to the truth

780
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:50,919
of understanding that my shepherd provides for me, I want you to understand this morning

781
00:37:50,919 --> 00:38:01,239
that the greatest need of mankind is salvation. The absolute number one greatest need of mankind

782
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:07,839
is salvation, reconciliation, being reconciled to God. Why? Because our sin separates us

783
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,639
from God. Our sin separates us from God. You say, well my sin is not really that bad. No,

784
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:20,239
your sin is bad. I say that with all grace and humility because grace, because sin is

785
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:29,639
offensive to a holy God. You say, well how much sin separates me from God? One. You say,

786
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,279
but I've worked really hard to keep all of this and do all of these things. It's not

787
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:41,239
how it works. You can't be reconciled to God that way. James says if we've offended in

788
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:48,239
one point we're guilty of all. And we find here this morning that the greatest need of

789
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,479
every human being, the greatest need that you have this morning is to be reconciled

790
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:59,799
to God, to be saved. You say, pastor I'm saved. Well then your greatest need has been met.

791
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:05,119
And simply because of that truth we should say my cup runneth over. Because my greatest

792
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,079
need has been met. If you're here this morning and you've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

793
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,559
your personal Savior, you say I have no idea what this is all about. I don't have that

794
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,759
kind of assurance. I don't know that the Lord is my shepherd personally. I don't know if

795
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:22,839
I were to die today that I'd go to heaven. I mean I hope I would but I don't know for

796
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,719
sure. I would say to you this morning that he wants to save you today. He wants to provide

797
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:34,559
for you today your greatest need and save your soul. Because the Lord, the shepherd,

798
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,919
my shepherd, he provides for me. And he knows what our greatest need is. Listen we can go

799
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:43,399
through life and some people, what do you need? I need this and I need that and I need

800
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,759
this and so on. Listen our greatest need, mankind, most of them are not aware of their

801
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:53,759
greatest need. Most people today if you were to take polls and surveys they would talk

802
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:59,399
about needs that are temporal things, that are temporal things. And there are people

803
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,319
today that run around and try to meet temporal

804
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:06,879
needs. And I'm not saying that we ought not care about people and try to help them with

805
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:10,199
their temporal needs, but what I am saying is that if we don't ever tell somebody about

806
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,539
their greatest need and tell them how their greatest need could ever be met through Jesus

807
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:23,239
Christ, then we failed. We failed. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only one that could provide

808
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:29,479
reconciliation. Somebody said this, if our greatest need had been information, God would

809
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:35,879
have sent us an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent

810
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:42,159
us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, how many people think that in our world

811
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:48,799
today? Then God would have sent us an economist. If our greatest need had been pleasure, many

812
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:56,239
that live that way today, God would have sent us an entertainer. But our greatest need was

813
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:05,439
forgiveness. So God, He sent us a Savior. His name is Jesus. He's my shepherd. Notice

814
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:13,719
what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5. We've read already in 1 Peter chapter

815
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:22,359
number 3 where the Bible says in that portion of Scripture to bring us to God. That He might

816
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:29,559
bring us to God. That act of reconciliation, of redeeming us and reconciling us. And we

817
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:33,599
find here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, notice what the Bible says, and we're going

818
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,079
to begin reading in verse number 18 of 2 Corinthians chapter number 5. And the Bible says, actually

819
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,279
back up to verse number 14. In verse number 14 the Bible says, for the love of Christ

820
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:49,839
constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

821
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,639
And so He's talking about Jesus Christ. He died for us. Remember, my shepherd, He died

822
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:58,839
for me. And that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto

823
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:04,279
themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore, verse 16, henceforth

824
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:08,279
know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet

825
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:15,959
now henceforth know we Him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

826
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:19,359
Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. I'm so thankful to be in

827
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:25,359
Christ. I'm thankful for how God changed my life. He transformed me. He's going to talk

828
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,239
about salvation. Salvation is not reformation. It's transformation. It's not trying to clean

829
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,559
ourselves up, trying to become a better me. No, no. God transforms us. Why? Because He

830
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,279
quickens us. He makes us alive in the Holy Spirit of God and dwells us. And we find here,

831
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,319
notice in verse number 18, and all things are of God who hath, notice what it says,

832
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,599
reconciled us to Himself, how? By Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

833
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,279
You know, for those of us that have been saved this morning, we're to live for Christ according

834
00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:02,759
to verse number 15, but we also notice that He's given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

835
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:07,599
Again, we understand that my shepherd provides for me the greatest need that I have, the

836
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,399
greatest need that every person I come into contact with is to be saved, reconciled. And

837
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:19,239
He's given unto us the ministry of reconciliation. And we find, it says in 19, in verse 19,

838
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:26,399
to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their

839
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:32,799
trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, we

840
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:39,479
are ambassadors for Christ. As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's

841
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:47,439
stead, be ye reconciled to God. Notice verse number 21, for He hath made Him to be sin

842
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:54,999
for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. Let me explain

843
00:43:54,999 --> 00:44:01,479
to you verse 21, many of you know it. God the Father made Him, God the Son, to be sin

844
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:09,199
for us. He knew no sin, He's perfect, He's sinless, He's the just. But He took upon

845
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:18,399
Himself the sin of the world and paid the awful penalty so that we might be made the

846
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:24,919
righteousness of God in Him. See today, so many people are trying to be reconciled to

847
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:30,799
God through some other means. But there are no other means. There's no other way to be

848
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:35,119
reconciled to God. You say, but Pastor, I'm doing as good as I can do. I mean, I'm doing

849
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,599
all the good things that I know that I could do. You can't reconcile you to God. Because

850
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,959
the Bible says that we're not saved by works. We're not saved by works. For by grace are

851
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:53,999
you saved through faith and not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest

852
00:44:53,999 --> 00:45:00,799
any man should boast. Paul said this in the book of Galatians, if righteousness came by

853
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:13,079
the law, then Christ is dead in vain. My Savior, my Shepherd did not die in vain.

854
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,799
He had to die so that we could be reconciled. He provides for us. Listen, I'm thankful for

855
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:24,599
all of His provision. I mean, He's been a good God. He's so good. He has provided to

856
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:34,199
us more than we could even fully comprehend. But my greatest need is met through Jesus

857
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:43,079
Christ, through my Shepherd. Your greatest need this morning is salvation. It's salvation

858
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:50,399
to have forgiveness of your sins, to know without any shadow of a doubt that heaven

859
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:56,559
is your home. Not because of anything that you have done, because you can't do it. Because

860
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,879
of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, His death, His burial, and His glorious resurrection.

861
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:07,359
Listen, sometimes we go through life and people say, how are you doing? I was thinking about

862
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,759
this week. You know what I'm going to start saying, Ron? I'm going to start saying, my

863
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:18,839
cup runneth over. I really am. I mean, with God's help, if I can remember, I'm going to

864
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,079
start telling people, Armando, my cup runneth over. And you know what people are going to

865
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,919
be living with, what does that mean? Maybe open a door for an opportunity to be able

866
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:32,159
to share. Why? Because sometimes we go through life. I know Mr. Don, absolutely wonderful.

867
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:39,039
I mean, I visited Mr. Don in the hospital. And Mr. Regine, she's been there. I'll say,

868
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,239
Don, how are you doing? He's laying in the hospital and he says, absolutely wonderful.

869
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:50,839
And it's a blessing. But could I say that not everyone has that perspective? Sometimes

870
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:57,999
we go through life like, man, we just want to have a pity party. Things are so bad. No,

871
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:09,319
no. As a child of God, my cup runneth over. It's not even just full. It runs over. I love

872
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:17,759
the imagery. It runs over. I don't know who wrote the song, but Mike Clark sings the song,

873
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:27,679
I'm drinking from my saucer because my cup runs over. I like that. And this morning,

874
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,519
why would I say, why should you say that my cup runneth over? Well, because my shepherd

875
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:42,679
loves me. My shepherd loves me. My shepherd died for me. My shepherd found me. My shepherd,

876
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:49,399
he cares about me. Number five, my shepherd, he provides for me. And he provided the greatest

877
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:55,159
need, the need of salvation. This morning, if you're not sure of heaven, I want to invite

878
00:47:55,159 --> 00:48:01,159
you to trust Christ today because your greatest need is salvation. This morning, if you've

879
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:07,039
been saved and you can say with the psalmist, the Lord is my shepherd, I would say to you

880
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,399
this morning, you should rejoice in that. You should be thankful in that. But you ought

881
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:16,559
to understand that God said that he gives you the ministry of reconciliation. And he

882
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:25,419
said to us that we are ambassadors, representatives, his witnesses. And he has committed unto us

883
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:31,019
this ministry, this word of reconciliation. This morning, we'll look at five more reasons

884
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:36,739
tonight. I hope that you'd fill out a whole lot more reasons on why you should say and

885
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:44,179
why I should say, my cup runneth over. Let's pray. Father, we love you. How we thank you

886
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:52,339
for loving us. Lord, I thank you for the word of God, the truth that's contained therein.

887
00:48:52,339 --> 00:49:00,699
I thank you this morning for these five powerful truths. Lord, I know the list could go on

888
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:11,099
and on and on. This morning, I hope that each of us would truly evaluate our lives and we

889
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,539
would agree with the psalmist and we would echo the words of the psalmist and say, my

890
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:23,979
cup runneth over. Not that we would just say it to say it, but that we would truly

891
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:34,859
acknowledge the truth this morning that our cup runneth over. You've been so good to us.

892
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:40,859
Father, if there's one here this morning that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, they're

893
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:49,299
not sure of heaven. Maybe they've heard the message before, maybe they've sat in this

894
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:58,779
church for years. They've never trusted Jesus as their Savior. They're trying to get to

895
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:02,379
heaven through their own works, through some reason.

896
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:09,299
religion. And I pray this morning the Holy Spirit would help them to understand there's

897
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:18,139
only one way to get to heaven and his name is Jesus. I pray that for those that are here

898
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:23,079
that are saved, they've trusted Christ as their Savior, they're heaven bound. God would

899
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:29,219
you help us to take seriously the ministry of reconciliation that you have entrusted

900
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:35,939
us with, that we would be good ambassadors, good representatives. God I pray that you

901
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:41,799
would use us for your honor and for your glory. Help us to go through life as my cup runneth

902
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:48,979
over Christians. Would you move and work in these moments of invitation as only you can.

903
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,379
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee and we'll thank you for it. In

904
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:57,879
Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? At the end of each of our services we

905
00:50:57,879 --> 00:51:03,399
have a moment of invitation where we invite you to respond. We don't ever seek to embarrass

906
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:10,439
anyone. We never call anybody out. But this morning maybe you don't know the shepherd.

907
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:14,159
You've never been saved. Would you come so that we could take a Bible and show you how

908
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,519
you could know for sure that heaven is your home? I would beg you not to leave here without

909
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,319
knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Maybe this morning you'd say, pastor I'm saved,

910
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:32,999
I've been born again, I know the shepherd. And I'm rejoicing because of it. This morning

911
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:38,399
maybe you need to come and ask God to help you in the area of being an ambassador. The

912
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:43,799
ministry of reconciliation that's been entrusted to each of us. Maybe this morning you want

913
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:49,959
to come and just thank God. Just rejoice a little while on why your cup runneth over.

914
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,799
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
