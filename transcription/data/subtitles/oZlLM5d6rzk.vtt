00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
of Psalms will be in Psalm 23.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.739
And if you've already looked at the back of the bulletin,

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:07.639
you'll see that we're doing part one and part two

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.340
for this morning and this evening.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.840
And looking at this very familiar Psalm,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.040
of course, Psalm 23 is probably just as familiar

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.780
as the song that we just sang, Amazing Grace.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.920
In fact, I've been to a number of funerals over my life

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.260
where even not being a church funeral

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.700
like what we would have here,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.939
many times people still will use that song, Amazing Grace,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:34.900
and still reference Psalm 23.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.599
It's very familiar to us.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.860
But I hope this morning that even though

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.380
this is a familiar Psalm,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.540
that God would help us to be attentive

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.340
and really get a truth that God has for us.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.459
The Bible says this beginning in verse number one.

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:50.819
I'm not gonna preach through the whole Psalm,

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.819
but I wanna read the entire Psalm

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.619
at the beginning of the message this morning.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:55.459
The Bible says,

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.919
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.659
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.599
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.540
He restoreth my soul.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.699
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.400
for his namesake.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.300
Yea, though I walk through the valley

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.180
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.839
for thou art with me.

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:22.120
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.980
Thou preparest a table before me

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.239
in the presence of mine enemies.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.879
Thou anointest my head with oil,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.580
my cup runneth over.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.980
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.459
all the days of my life,

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.019
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.160
The song that we just sang in this Psalm

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.739
goes so well together.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.940
I didn't pick the songs, Dean always does,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.699
but it's always a blessing to me.

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:51.199
And you have those weeks when they just

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:52.639
go together so well.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.900
And this morning as we look at this particular Psalm,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.099
again a very familiar Psalm,

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.599
it's full of powerful truth

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.239
and really not part of the message,

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.940
but certainly important to deal with.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.419
Notice in the very beginning of this Psalm

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:07.180
that the psalmist, the human penman

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.820
that God used to write the Psalm is David.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.820
And the Bible says, the Lord is my shepherd.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.160
And I want you to just think about that truth

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.660
just for a moment this morning.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.259
He is the shepherd, he's the good shepherd,

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.520
he's the great shepherd, he's the chief shepherd.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.479
But notice that David says, the Lord is my shepherd.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.399
And that possessive truth that we find

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.119
in this particular Psalm,

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.039
he says the Lord is my shepherd.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.559
And I wonder this morning,

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.759
how many of us could say,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.440
I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hands,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.119
but how many of us could say this morning with David

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.399
that the Lord is my shepherd?

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.679
Not just that he is the shepherd

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.759
or the good shepherd and so on and so forth,

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.880
but the Lord is my shepherd.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.899
I would say to you this morning,

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.160
there's only one way for the Lord to be your shepherd.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.520
And that's through accepting him

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.479
as your personal Lord and savior.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.679
In John chapter number 10,

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.360
and we'll actually look at some of those verses

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.399
this morning, the Bible teaches us

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.600
in that portion of scripture

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.199
that Jesus is the good shepherd.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.679
And the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.600
And he says this in verse number 27,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.919
as you go through the end of that chapter,

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.360
he says this, my sheep hear my voice

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.059
and I know them and I give unto them eternal life

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.660
and they shall never perish.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.699
And so it's interesting as you compare

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.419
those two portions of scripture

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.419
that here, David says the Lord is my shepherd.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.339
There, Jesus says, my sheep hear my voice.

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.580
And this morning, I hope that you have assurance

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.059
that Jesus is your shepherd,

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.979
that the Lord is your shepherd.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:43.940
We'll deal with a few things

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.740
as we get into the message this morning.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.820
And if you're not sure of that, man,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.160
we'd love today for you to have that level of confidence.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.699
But I want you to see as we look at this psalm

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.240
at the bookends by way of introduction,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.199
the last statement of this psalm in verse number six says,

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.199
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.820
And I want you to understand there is a great connection

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.679
between verse number one and verse number six.

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.600
The truth of verse number one,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.919
the Lord is my shepherd is the basis

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.820
for the truth in verse number six,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.019
that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.779
You cannot this morning say that I will dwell

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.859
in the house of the Lord forever

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:29.140
if you do not know the Lord as your shepherd.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.420
And we find that there's a great connection

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.980
between verse one and verse six

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.279
and so many wonderful truths that are packed in between.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.940
But I'm thankful this morning

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.880
that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.019
because the Lord is my shepherd.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:47.739
We think about this even the terminology.

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.980
Someone sent me a text this week

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.339
and it was kind of interesting the way

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.739
that the text kind of worked even with this thought here

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:53.899
from verse number six.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.779
Notice it's the house of who?

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.260
It's the house of the Lord.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.700
The Lord is there.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.140
And that's what makes heaven heaven

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.220
is the fact that Jesus is there.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.339
And what a tremendous blessing.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.220
But we think about this particular psalm

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.420
and so many rich truths that are contained within this psalm.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.519
But I really wanna focus our attention this day,

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.839
this morning and this evening

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.920
on that last phrase in verse number five

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.899
where the psalmist says, my cup runneth over.

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:23.640
My cup runneth over.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.200
The imagery of this statement is beautiful.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.040
No doubt in your mind and in mine

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.119
when you read that statement, my cup runneth over,

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.600
you think about the abundance,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.959
you think about the extra, if you will,

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.119
and you find that this imagery

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:39.959
of this single statement of God's word,

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.079
it reveals to us the goodness of God

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.059
in the lives of His children.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:46.100
And certainly this morning,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.160
I believe that every one of us would agree

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.640
that God has been abundantly good to us,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.399
that God has blessed us beyond measure,

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.399
that even as I prayed this morning,

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.880
as the psalmist says, that the Lord hath daily,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.959
He's daily loadeth me with benefits.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.239
It's not just He's sprinkled them upon us,

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:09.320
no, He's loaded us with benefits.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.559
And what a blessing.

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.160
I'm sure at some point in your life,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.779
I've heard it often in my life

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.799
that you've heard somebody speaking about the idea

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:20.200
of whether an individual is an optimist or a pessimist.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.799
How many have heard people talk about this before?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.359
And oftentimes what they'll use

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:27.040
is they'll use a metaphor of a cup of water.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.600
And in using that metaphor,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.320
they'll say, are you a half full

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.839
or half empty kind of a person?

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.079
You've heard that before.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.720
And they use that terminology,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.600
they use that metaphor in order to try to help us determine

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.880
are you an optimist or a pessimist?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.679
And we've heard that and people have used that,

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:47.600
but I would submit to you this morning

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
that as a child of the King,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.720
I'm thankful this morning that my cup's not half full,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.920
my cup's not half empty, my cup runneth over.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.440
My cup runneth over.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.880
And this morning, as we see the psalmist boldly declaring

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.260
and making the statement as our minds are fixed this week

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:09.459
on the subject of Thanksgiving and we have this holiday,

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.980
listen, it's not just that we'd sit around

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.579
and fill ourselves with all of these particular items

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:18.579
that find themselves on the menu of Thanksgiving.

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:21.220
It's not that we'd sit around and just watch football

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.459
or have family time and that sort of thing.

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:27.220
No, we must recognize the giver of all good gifts.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.579
And surely each of us this morning

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:33.820
should be able to say my cup runneth over.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.059
My cup runneth over.

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:37.519
This morning and this evening,

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.420
I want to provide for you 10 reasons,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.859
10 biblical reasons that every child of God

00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:47.459
should say my cup runneth over.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:48.299
My cup runneth over.

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:51.779
Number one, if you're taking notes, my shepherd loves me.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.579
My shepherd loves me.

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:56.859
I hope that you never get over that.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:58.420
I sang this morning, one of the songs

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.700
that we sang in Sunday school this morning

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.700
was Jesus loves me.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.779
What a precious, precious truth of God's word.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:06.459
The songwriter of that particular song

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:10.220
said Jesus loves me, this I know.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.660
It's not a hope so, it's not a think so,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.920
it's not I hope Jesus, no, I know that Jesus loves me.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.760
Why?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.019
For the Bible tells me so.

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.140
And I'm so thankful that God and his word

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.859
has declared to us his love for us

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:26.440
and he's revealed to us his love for us.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.859
And we find this morning that our shepherd,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.219
my shepherd, my shepherd loves me.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.919
Nothing can separate me from the love of God,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.020
which is in Christ Jesus.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.940
Look at a few verses of scripture with me

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.580
and have your hands ready this morning.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.820
We'll look at a number of scriptures this morning.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.760
But notice in John chapter number three,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.380
and I want you to read it this morning.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.539
For so many of us this morning, we could quote John 3.16.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:50.979
It's a very familiar verse of scripture.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:54.859
But I want you to read it this morning and look at it.

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:59.140
I want you to allow the Lord to use the word of God

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.099
to impress upon your heart and to encourage you this morning

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:06.960
with this truth that God loves you.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.099
You know, there's some folks in our world today

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:11.500
that they feel like they're not loved.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.400
They feel like no one loves me, no one cares about me,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.239
no one knows.

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:16.719
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:18.580
that no matter what's going on in your life,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.659
no matter what trial you're facing,

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:22.739
no matter what hardship we're enduring,

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.020
that we can rejoice and we can say my cup runneth over.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.859
Listen, just if this was the only point today,

00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:33.780
my cup runneth over because God loves me.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.859
That's enough, but there's so much more.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:39.419
The 10 reasons that I'm gonna give you

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.940
between this morning and this evening, it's not exhaustive.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.619
We could go on and on and on.

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:47.140
But this morning, look at John 3.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.260
The Bible says this in verse number 16.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.260
For God so loved the world

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.020
that he gave his only begotten Son

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.020
that whosoever believeth in him shall not die.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.320
who believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.120
Notice verse 17,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.200
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.000
but that the world through him might be saved.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.840
You know, we were condemned already.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.500
But I'm thankful this morning because the Lord is my shepherd

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.080
and because my shepherd loves me that I no longer,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.880
there's no condemnation for those who believe

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.440
and praise the Lord for that wonderful truth.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.640
And we find here this morning that the Bible says,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.180
For God so loved the world.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.940
And someone says, well, you don't understand what I've done.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.180
God does, and he still says that he loves you.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.820
Praise God for that.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.460
Because at times, if we'd be honest,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.520
we're not very lovable.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.680
Amen.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.200
But God loves you and he loves me.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.400
My shepherd loves me.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.820
Romans five and verse number eight,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.520
a verse that's very familiar to us.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.400
And the Bible says there that God commended his love toward us.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.260
And that while we were yet sinners,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.300
Christ died for us.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.160
And I think about the demonstration of God's love.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.440
He declared it, but he demonstrated it.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.140
And he said, I loved you so much that I died for you,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.340
that I took your place.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.300
And we find that that was his demonstration of his love.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.180
But I want you to look at Romans eight.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.980
And it's the passage that a lot of times we'll go to

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.980
when we think about the love of Christ

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.620
and how thankful we ought to be this morning

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.980
that my shepherd loves me.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.240
In Romans chapter number eight and verse number 35,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.680
the question is asked,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.520
who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.780
We'll read all the verses,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.760
but I'm thankful this morning that the answer is nothing.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.560
There's nothing that can separate you

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.820
from the love of Christ.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.660
The Bible says,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.260
shall tribulation or distress or persecution

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.440
or famine or nakedness or peril or sword,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.160
as it is written, for thy sake,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.980
we are killed all the day long.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.420
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.100
Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.420
Notice, through him that loved us.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.740
Notice what the writer says, Paul, the human penman.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.360
He says, I am persuaded.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.900
I am persuaded of what?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.540
That neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.240
nor powers nor things present nor things to come

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.520
nor height, nor depth,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.380
nor any other creature shall be able to separate us

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.720
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.020
I hope this morning that you would say my cup runneth over.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.960
Why? Because my shepherd loves me.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.560
My shepherd loves me.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.260
There's some times in your life that the enemy might,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.940
he's the accuser of the brethren, by the way.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.160
He might whisper in your ear that God doesn't love you.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.740
If he really loved you, he wouldn't, listen,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.940
nothing can separate us from the love of God.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.800
The songwriter said, this I know, Jesus loves me.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.500
This I know.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.940
Why? For the Bible tells me so.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.440
He didn't say because my circumstances tell me so.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.540
He didn't say because my feelings tell me so.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.980
He said, because the Bible tells me so.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.740
And our emotions and our feelings and our circumstances

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.380
do not dictate to us what is truth.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.360
It is God's word that reveals to us what is truth.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.660
And so number one this morning,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.280
why would I say my cup runneth over?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.720
Because my shepherd loves me.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.140
Number two, not only because my shepherd loves me,

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.280
but my shepherd died for me.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.820
My shepherd died for me.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.160
It shows me the love of God,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.080
but it also reveals to me as I think about the love of God,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.460
demonstrate it through the fact

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.760
that the Lord Jesus Christ died for me.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.560
It shows me the value that he's placed upon my life

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.720
and upon your life.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.120
He loved you so much that he was willing to die for you.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.920
You say, pastor, why did Jesus have to die?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.560
Well, because sin had to be paid for.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.840
The Bible says that the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.680
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.400
that the wages of sin is death.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.840
And we find this morning that all have sinned

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.200
and come short of the glory of God.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.040
Every single one of us that are sitting here this morning

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.880
have sinned.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.760
We are guilty before a holy God.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.920
Every one of us.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.440
You say, well, I'm not as bad as,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.540
I don't care if you're not as bad as, you're guilty.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.360
And by the way, it's funny how we always try

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.840
to find somebody worse off than we are

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.240
to compare ourselves to,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.120
when we wanna try to make ourselves feel like we're good.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.600
But we're all guilty.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.320
Some of us this morning,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.560
we've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, our savior,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.640
so we are saved sinners.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.480
Amen?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.800
We are heaven-bound sinners.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.520
But this morning, when we understand the truth

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.960
that Jesus died for me, my shepherd died for me,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.080
we find in John chapter number 10,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.840
and I want you to look in John 10.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.560
It's a powerful passage of scripture.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.780
In fact, between this morning and this evening,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.320
we're gonna look at a number of verses

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.040
from John chapter number 10

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.680
and how the correlation, the connection

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.040
between Psalm 23 and John 10,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.880
it's so obvious and so powerful.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.400
And we find that here,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.640
Jesus begins in verse number one of John 10,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.280
and he says, verily, verily,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.600
this is of a truth of a truth.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.240
God's word is truth.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.480
Jesus Christ himself is truth.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.480
And he says this, I say unto you,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.880
he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.760
but climbeth up some other way,

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.440
the same as a thief and a robber,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.960
but he that entereth in by the door

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.060
is the shepherd of the sheep.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.800
I'm thankful this morning the Lord is my shepherd.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.760
And we mentioned that already,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.160
but we find that as we look through

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.700
this portion of scripture,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.120
that not only is Jesus going to declare to us

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.680
that he is the shepherd, that he is the door,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.040
but you find that he's going to reveal to us

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.640
that as our shepherd, he took our place

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.920
and he died for us.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.240
In verse three, to him, the porter openeth

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.520
and the sheep hear his voice

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.480
and he calleth his own sheep,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.920
notice his own sheep by name,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.480
and leadeth them out.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.400
And when he put forth his own sheep,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.900
he goeth before them and the sheep follow him,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.000
for they know his voice.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.400
And a stranger will they not follow,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.520
but will flee from him,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.500
for they know not the voice of a stranger's.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.140
It says this, this parable spake Jesus unto them,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.340
but they understood not what things they were

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.900
which he spake unto them.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.020
And this happened often during the earthly ministry

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.140
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.900
He would teach and there would be some uncertainty

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.380
as to what is the meaning,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.140
what is the message that he's seeking to teach us.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.460
And so what does Jesus do?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.020
Well, he gives more explanation.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.060
And I'm thankful that he's a loving,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.100
gracious, patient God.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.180
And you go to God's word and there are times

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.400
in which we don't understand

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.880
and we can say, Lord, would you help me to understand?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.520
And here, notice what Jesus says to them

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.920
after they understood not according to verse number six.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.480
He says, verily, verily, I say unto you,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.040
notice he makes it very plain,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.540
I am the door of the sheep.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.160
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.080
but the sheep did not hear them.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.240
I am the door.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.520
By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.440
and shall go in and out and find pasture.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.960
Notice the contrast in verse 10 for the thief,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.000
cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.280
I am come that they might have life

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.960
and that they might have it more abundantly.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.360
I am the good shepherd.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.200
Notice what he says,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.960
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.040
Why does my cup runneth over?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.160
Because my shepherd died for me.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.000
He died for me.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.720
I was guilty.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.920
You were guilty.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.460
We deserve death.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.580
Not only do we deserve physical death,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.620
but we deserve spiritual death.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.700
And really, that's what's being spoken of

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.780
when the Bible says the wage of sin is death.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.900
It's yes, death is the result,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.460
physical death, the result of sin,

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.600
but the wage of sin is that second death,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.300
that spiritual death.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.180
And here, the Bible says that the good shepherd

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.060
giveth his life for the sheep.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.260
He did for me and he did for you

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.220
what we could not do for ourselves.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.100
And he died for us.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.580
He took our place.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.660
And we sing the song sometimes at Christmas time,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.180
sometimes at Easter, about it was for me.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.540
And it was for me that he went

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.380
and he went to that cross and he died an awful death.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.940
And I'm so thankful that he didn't stay dead.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.260
He went to a borrowed tomb

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.420
and he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.020
He's alive forevermore.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.660
But we find this morning that my shepherd died for me.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.739
Notice in verse number 15, it says this,

00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:39.140
"'And the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.780
"'and I lay down my life for the sheep.'"

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.820
He says this, "'And other sheep I have,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.900
"'which are not of this fold, them also I must bring,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.140
"'and they shall hear my voice,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.860
"'and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.140
"'Therefore doth my Father love me, why?

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.220
"'Because I lay down my life, then I might take it again.'"

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.420
Notice the powerful truth in verse 18.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.020
"'No man taketh it from me.'"

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.340
He said, but then the Romans arrest him

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.500
and no man taketh it, he lays it down.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.860
He went willingly to that cross.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.580
He suffered all that he did willingly

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.940
so that you and I could be redeemed.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.260
Notice this is in verse 18,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.500
"'But I lay it down on myself.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.619
"'I have power to lay it down

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:26.059
"'and I have power to take it again.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:29.140
"'This commandment have I received of my Father.'"

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.380
If you were to look at the record of the crucifixion,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.340
Pilate was so confused

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.739
when he heard that Jesus was dead already.

00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:36.580
Why?

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.540
Because of the timing.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.420
But remember, Jesus said it is finished

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.260
and he gave up the ghost is what the Bible tells us.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.380
And he laid down his life for us.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.820
He died for us because he loves us.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.460
And we find this morning

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.660
that why should we live through life?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.300
Why should we walk through life?

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.179
And echo the words of the psalmist

00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:56.780
that my cup runneth over.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.220
Listen, this idea of my cup is half full or half empty

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.179
is nonsense for the child of God.

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:05.979
we ought to be my cup runneth over kind of people

00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:09.979
because my shepherd loves me and because my shepherd died for me.

00:20:09.979 --> 00:20:12.479
He did for me what I could not do for myself.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:15.479
I remember it was just over a year ago

00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:18.979
that I stood in the very place there in Israel

00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:22.179
where I had the opportunity, and I thank the Lord for it,

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.479
to be in the place where most likely Jesus,

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:27.479
when he was arrested and kept overnight

00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:30.979
with the situation at Caiaphas' house and all that took place,

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.279
and to be able to see and to remember

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:36.279
being in the Garden of Gethsemane and all that took place

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:40.279
and thinking about all that my Savior endured for me

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:43.779
and going to the place Golgotha, the place of a skull,

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:49.279
and thinking about that place where my Savior died for me.

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:51.279
But then seeing there's an empty tomb

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:54.279
because he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:59.279
Listen, this morning, my faith is not based on being at that place.

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:02.579
My faith is in a person and in the truth of God's Word.

00:21:02.579 --> 00:21:07.079
You may never have the opportunity on this side of eternity

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:10.579
to be able to be in Jerusalem and see those places personally,

00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:13.079
but I tell you this morning that I'm so thankful

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:16.579
that God's given us the truth in his Word, that he died for us.

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:19.079
It is a settled fact of history.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.079
It is a biblical truth that Jesus died for me.

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:24.579
Notice with me 1 Peter 3.

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:28.079
Notice this wonderful truth that God gives us

00:21:28.879 --> 00:21:32.879
when it could impact you and me this morning to go through life.

00:21:32.879 --> 00:21:36.879
Listen, my shepherd died for me.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:43.879
In 1 Peter 3, in verse number 18,

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.879
the Bible says,

00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:51.879
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins.

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:53.879
He suffered on that cross.

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.879
I want you to notice the emphasis that once suffered for sins.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.679
This man, according to Hebrews chapter number 10,

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:02.679
made one sacrifice for sin forever.

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:03.679
Hallelujah.

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:04.679
And what a blessing.

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:06.679
He sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:08.679
But the Bible says, notice in verse 18,

00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:12.679
The just for the unjust.

00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:15.679
The just is Jesus.

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:19.679
The unjust is every other person that's ever walked upon the face of the earth.

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.679
The unjust.

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:22.679
He died for us.

00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:23.679
The just for the unjust.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:25.479
Why?

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:29.479
That he might bring us to God.

00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:31.479
That he might bring us to God.

00:22:31.479 --> 00:22:35.479
Being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.479
There are many other verses that we could look to this morning,

00:22:38.479 --> 00:22:40.479
but I want to say to you from this verse of Scripture

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:43.479
that the only way that he could bring us to God

00:22:43.479 --> 00:22:45.479
was through dying in our place.

00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:46.479
It's the only way.

00:22:46.479 --> 00:22:48.479
There's no other way that he could bring us to God.

00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:50.479
He could not just arbitrarily decide that,

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:52.479
Oh yeah, I'm going to let all these people go to hell.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.279
He had to die for us.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:57.279
It was the only way for man to be reconciled

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.279
and we'll deal with that in just a few moments.

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:02.279
But notice with me a third reason.

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:04.279
Number one, my shepherd loves me.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.279
Number two, my shepherd died for me.

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:07.279
Number three, my shepherd found me.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.279
My shepherd found me.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:12.279
You know, you've probably heard people use at times,

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:14.279
and I understand what they mean by it,

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.279
but they'll say something like this,

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:16.279
I found the Lord.

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:19.279
You've heard people say that, use that terminology.

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:22.279
And I believe truly the biblical record would reveal to us

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:25.279
that I really didn't find Jesus, he found me.

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.279
Amen?

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:31.279
The reality this morning is that we have a shepherd

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:34.279
that cares about us, a shepherd that loves us

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.279
and died for us and he found me.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.279
I begin to think about my own life

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:41.279
and I begin to think about my childhood and my upbringing

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:44.279
and I begin to think about how the gospel was brought to me.

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:46.279
And maybe this morning you'd spend a few moments

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:49.279
and thinking in your own mind of how the gospel was brought to you.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:54.279
Maybe the circumstances that led to you hearing the gospel for the first time.

00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:57.279
Maybe it was somebody that God used at a workplace.

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.279
Maybe it was a neighbor.

00:23:58.279 --> 00:24:04.279
Maybe it was a family member that introduced you to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:08.279
I think about my children and my children have a different story than I have

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.279
because they were raised in a Christian home.

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:14.279
They were raised in a home where they heard the gospel from a young age.

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:18.279
They were raised in a home where we went to church from the day they were born

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:20.279
and they don't know anything different.

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:23.279
And some of you have that same testimony.

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:26.279
But some of us, we don't have that testimony.

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.279
I wasn't raised in church.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.279
I didn't hear the gospel when I was a kid.

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.279
Someone said to me when I was about 12 years old,

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.279
do you want to go to heaven when you die?

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:35.279
And it's like, well, I mean, what's the alternative?

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.279
I don't want to go to hell.

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:38.279
Sure, I want to go to heaven.

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:39.279
But how was I going to get to heaven?

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:42.279
I had no idea how I was going to get to heaven.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:46.279
I never understood why Jesus died.

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:50.279
I never knew that Jesus loved me.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:55.279
But there was a man that shared the gospel with my dad.

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:58.279
He shared the testimony here before.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:04.279
And because of that, I found out the truth of the gospel.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:09.279
And in your life and in my life, I think about how Jesus found us.

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:12.279
The Bible tells us in Luke 19 in verse number 10,

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:14.279
and this description is wonderful

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.279
as we think about the truth that is found for us.

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:19.279
Of course, there's a parable about the,

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:21.279
as Jesus speaks to the folks there

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:24.279
and how the 99 and the shepherd would leave

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:27.279
to search for the one and so on and so forth.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:30.279
But I find this morning that as I look at Luke 19

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.279
and I understand the account that is provided,

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:36.279
there's a man by the name of Zacchaeus in Luke 19.

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:38.279
And we're familiar with Zacchaeus.

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:41.279
Zacchaeus was a man that was not very well liked.

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.279
Let's put it that way.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:45.279
And he was a man that was of little stature, the Bible tells us.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.279
But he's a man that as we look at this text of Scripture,

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:52.279
he's a man that gets saved.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.279
He has salvation.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:58.279
But I want you to notice what Jesus says in Luke 19 in verse number 10.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:06.279
For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:08.279
To seek and to save.

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:12.279
Why did Jesus pass through Jericho on this particular day?

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.279
Because there was a sinner that needed to be saved.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:16.279
Why did Jesus say in John chapter number 4,

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:18.279
I must needs go through Samaria?

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:20.279
Because there was a woman that was going to be at the well

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:23.279
that needed to hear the truth of the gospel.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:25.279
Jesus found me.

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:29.279
I'm so thankful that my shepherd found me this morning.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:32.279
Can you imagine this morning?

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:34.279
It's hard for me to even wrap my mind around it.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:36.279
Can you imagine being lost?

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:40.279
I mean, not knowing that if you were to die today that you'd go to heaven.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:42.279
I'm not talking about hoping that you'd go to heaven.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:44.279
I'm talking about knowing.

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:47.279
Because the Lord is my shepherd.

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:52.279
In verse number 6, I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.279
My shepherd, he loves me.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.279
My shepherd died for me.

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:58.279
My shepherd found me.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:26:59.279
He found me.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.279
And he found you.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:04.279
I don't know where he found you, but I know where he found me.

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:06.279
And I'm so thankful he found me.

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:10.279
Number 4 this morning, my shepherd cares for me.

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:14.279
It's amazing to me that he loves me.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:15.279
He died for me.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.279
He found me.

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:18.279
But then he cares about me.

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:22.279
I mean, he doesn't just leave me to my own resources.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:24.279
He doesn't just leave me on my own.

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.279
No, he cares about every aspect of my life.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.279
And he cares about you this morning.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:35.279
We sing the song, no one ever cared for me like Jesus.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:38.279
And I hope this morning that you can acknowledge that truth.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:41.279
If you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:43.279
you'd say, my shepherd cares about me.

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:45.279
When it seems like no one else cares.

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:49.279
No doubt there's times in your life that you might feel like no one cares.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:50.279
No one even knows.

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:52.279
No one understands.

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:56.279
I would tell you this morning that Jesus cares.

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.279
I know he cares.

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.279
That's what the songwriter says.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.279
I know he cares.

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.279
The question is asked, it's a different song.

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:05.279
I spoke about no one ever cared for me like Jesus, but there's another.

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:07.279
Does Jesus care?

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:09.279
Yes, he cares.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.279
I know he cares.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:12.279
Why do I know he cares?

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:14.279
Because he's told me in his word again.

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.279
And that's a wonderful truth.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.279
Remember, it's not based on your feelings.

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.279
It's not based on your emotions.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.279
It's not based on your circumstances.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.279
It's based on truth that God has given us in his word.

00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:25.279
And this morning, I know that my shepherd cares for me.

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:29.279
Notice in 1 Peter 5, again, familiar verses of scripture.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:34.279
But I hope this morning that when we consider these 10 truths,

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:38.279
and we'll look at 5 here this morning, and we'll look at 5 this evening.

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.279
But I hope this morning when you consider these things,

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:45.279
that you would walk through your life and say, man, my cup, surely, it runs over.

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.279
My cup runneth over.

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:50.279
God has been so good to me.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:55.279
Listen, sometimes as God's people, we can complain with the best of them.

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.279
Amen?

00:28:56.279 --> 00:29:00.279
We can go through life complaining and murmuring just like a lost person would.

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:06.279
In fact, there are times that some lost people might be more thankful than some of God's people.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.279
Amen?

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:12.279
I know no one wants to admit that, but it's true.

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:15.279
But my cup runneth over.

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.279
It's perspective.

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:17.279
It's perspective.

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:24.279
Notice in 1 Peter 5, in verse number 7, the Bible says,

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:36.279
casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:40.279
He didn't say cast some of your care on him.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:42.279
He didn't say cast most of your care on him.

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:44.279
He said casting all.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:47.279
Listen, he can handle it.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:50.279
You can't.

00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:52.279
He can handle it.

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:53.279
You can't.

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.279
I can't handle it, but God can.

00:29:56.279 --> 00:30:00.279
You know, it's an amazing thing that we can take it to Jesus.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:01.279
Tell it to Jesus.

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.279
We can just take it.

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:07.659
it and tell it to him. We can cast our care upon him. You know, sometimes when we think

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:13.939
about that truth of leave your burden, like, you know, leave it there, imagery sometimes

00:30:13.939 --> 00:30:18.339
in our minds would go to an old-fashioned altar and we pour our heart before God and

00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:22.219
pour out, cast our burden upon him. But sometimes we get up from praying and we take it right

00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:31.299
back with us. It's hard as human beings, our minds, it's hard. But he says, casting all

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:35.819
your care upon him. I hope you can see the imagery of that idea of casting something

00:30:35.819 --> 00:30:41.779
down. I mean, I'm putting this at the feet of Jesus because he cares for me. He cares

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:47.099
for me. Notice in verse number, in Psalm 55, turn over if you will to Psalm 55, a sister

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:52.299
verse here to what we see in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 7. And thinking about this truth

00:30:52.299 --> 00:31:00.979
this morning that Jesus, my shepherd, he cares for me. This morning he cares for you. He

00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:12.739
cares for you. In Psalm 55, in verse number 22, the Bible says, cast thy burden upon

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:19.459
the Lord. Casting all your care upon him, we read in 1 Peter 5, 7, why? For he careth

00:31:19.459 --> 00:31:27.459
for you. Here we find in Psalm 55 and verse 22, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he

00:31:27.459 --> 00:31:34.819
shall sustain thee. He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. Now let me think

00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:38.659
about, let's look at this verse a moment. He didn't say, cast thy burden upon the Lord

00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:44.979
and he might sustain thee. He didn't even say, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he

00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:52.859
can sustain thee. Right? Listen, I'm thankful that he can, but if the verse just said that

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:59.179
he can, it wouldn't carry as much weight. Do you agree? Because certainly some people

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:05.379
can do some things, but it doesn't mean they're going to. Amen? People that can do some things,

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:13.499
but they don't do it. Here the Bible says, cast thy burden upon the Lord and he shall

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:22.059
sustain thee. You say, I just can't go anymore. Have you cast your burden upon the Lord? Because

00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:28.419
the Bible says he shall sustain thee. Amen? I'm not seeking to be lacking any kind of

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:32.459
comfort or being compassionate, but I'm simply saying this morning that are we going to take

00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:41.379
God at his word? Because God said in his word that he shall sustain us. He's the sustainer.

00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:45.259
I'm thankful he's the giver of life, but he's the sustainer. Remember what he said in John

00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:51.959
10? I've come to give them a life that they might have it more abundantly. Notice the

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:58.279
rest of the verse in verse 22. He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. I'm thankful

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:04.119
that he'll sustain us. Sometimes part of the problem is that we're not doing the first

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:10.119
part of the verse. We're not casting our burden upon the Lord. We're not receiving that sustaining

00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:15.179
power of God. We're not receiving what we could receive. Why? Because we're keeping

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:19.999
the burden ourselves. We're keeping the cares to ourselves, but God says, no, I want you

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:24.079
to know how much I care about you. I want you to know that you can cast your care upon

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:28.079
the Lord. Listen, this morning I'm thankful that I'm saved. I'm thankful that I'm heaven

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:32.599
bound, but I will say to you this morning that the moment that you got saved, all of

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:38.439
your cares did not just disappear. All of your problems did not cease. Your life did

00:33:38.439 --> 00:33:46.359
not become perfect on this earth. Am I right? So isn't it good to know the Lord that sustains

00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:52.439
you, that says cast your burden, that says cast your care? This morning, if you're not

00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:56.639
sure of heaven, you've never trusted Christ as your savior. The reality is that when you

00:33:56.639 --> 00:34:00.439
trust Christ, it doesn't mean he's going to fix all your problems immediately and everything

00:34:00.439 --> 00:34:04.879
is just going to be, somebody said it this way, a bed of roses. I remember hearing that

00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:08.439
many years ago and I said, well, you know that roses have thorns, right? And I don't

00:34:08.439 --> 00:34:12.759
know that I want to be in a bed of roses anyway, amen? But I understand the imagery. I understand

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:16.839
the metaphor, the reason that they would use that statement. But this morning, listen,

00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:22.559
understand that I'm thankful that I have someone that I know personally, the Lord is my shepherd

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:28.739
and I can cast my care upon him. I can cast my burden upon him. Why? Because he's my shepherd.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:34.199
Because he's my God. He's my savior. And he's your savior. Is my life going to be problem

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:40.599
free? No. Listen, if somebody ever tells you that, they're lying to you. If someone tells

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:44.679
you that you trust Christ and your life's going to be problem free, they are lying to

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:53.679
you. Amen? One day, absolutely. When this mortal shall put off immortality or should

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:58.199
put on immortality, this corruption should put on incorruption, 1 Corinthians 15. Oh

00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:06.359
yeah, at that time, I'm going to have no more problems. But until then, our lives are going

00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:11.839
to have difficulties. But I know the shepherd, the Lord is my shepherd and I can cast my

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:20.079
burden. I can cast all my care upon him. Why? Because my shepherd cares about me. This morning,

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:26.439
my cup runneth over. My cup runneth over. Number five this morning, my shepherd provides

00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:31.519
for me. My shepherd provides for me. You know, there's something interesting about sheep.

00:35:31.519 --> 00:35:38.799
Turn back to Psalm 23, if you will. There's something interesting about sheep. Sheep are

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:53.759
really kind of helpless animals. They really are. They're defenseless. Sheep need a shepherd.

00:35:53.759 --> 00:36:00.479
There's an enemy. We can read about the natural predators to sheep and you can see in the

00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:09.119
scriptures even some of the examples that God gives us. But we have an enemy, Satan,

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:14.039
the devil. The Bible says that he walketh about seeking whom he may devour. And I'm

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:18.759
thankful that my God, my shepherd, he provides for me. He provides protection for me. He

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:27.119
provides everything that I need. And I think about the sheep as they are such needy animals.

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:32.759
And the shepherd, the shepherd provides for them. And here in Psalm 23 and verse number

00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:41.159
1, the Bible says, the Lord is my shepherd. Notice the next words, I shall not want. I

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:50.079
shall not want. It's amazing how a shepherd, a good shepherd, takes care of his sheep.

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:55.559
Our God is a good shepherd. The Lord is the good shepherd. He's been good to us and he

00:36:55.559 --> 00:37:01.159
provides for us. The Bible says in verse number 2 of Psalm 23, he maketh me to lie

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:06.959
down in green pastures. Listen, I'm thankful for the, again, the imagery that we see here

00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:13.119
in this 23rd Psalm. He didn't just say in pastures, he said in green pastures. Representing

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:17.159
to us and understanding to us the sustenance and the nourishment that the sheep would receive.

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:23.319
Why? Because it's a green pasture. Notice it says this, he leadeth me beside what? The

00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:30.079
still waters. Why the still waters? Because sheep can't drink from rushing waters. They

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:36.919
can't. They need still waters. This morning, we see how the shepherd provides. We see how

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:41.359
my shepherd provides for me. But I would submit to you this morning that as we look at this

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:46.799
phrase or these words of Scripture in Psalm 23 and where our mind is rushing to the truth

00:37:46.799 --> 00:37:50.919
of understanding that my shepherd provides for me, I want you to understand this morning

00:37:50.919 --> 00:38:01.239
that the greatest need of mankind is salvation. The absolute number one greatest need of mankind

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:07.839
is salvation, reconciliation, being reconciled to God. Why? Because our sin separates us

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:13.639
from God. Our sin separates us from God. You say, well my sin is not really that bad. No,

00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:20.239
your sin is bad. I say that with all grace and humility because grace, because sin is

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:29.639
offensive to a holy God. You say, well how much sin separates me from God? One. You say,

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:34.279
but I've worked really hard to keep all of this and do all of these things. It's not

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:41.239
how it works. You can't be reconciled to God that way. James says if we've offended in

00:38:41.239 --> 00:38:48.239
one point we're guilty of all. And we find here this morning that the greatest need of

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:53.479
every human being, the greatest need that you have this morning is to be reconciled

00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:59.799
to God, to be saved. You say, pastor I'm saved. Well then your greatest need has been met.

00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:05.119
And simply because of that truth we should say my cup runneth over. Because my greatest

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:11.079
need has been met. If you're here this morning and you've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:14.559
your personal Savior, you say I have no idea what this is all about. I don't have that

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:18.759
kind of assurance. I don't know that the Lord is my shepherd personally. I don't know if

00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:22.839
I were to die today that I'd go to heaven. I mean I hope I would but I don't know for

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:26.719
sure. I would say to you this morning that he wants to save you today. He wants to provide

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:34.559
for you today your greatest need and save your soul. Because the Lord, the shepherd,

00:39:34.559 --> 00:39:39.919
my shepherd, he provides for me. And he knows what our greatest need is. Listen we can go

00:39:39.959 --> 00:39:43.399
through life and some people, what do you need? I need this and I need that and I need

00:39:43.399 --> 00:39:47.759
this and so on. Listen our greatest need, mankind, most of them are not aware of their

00:39:47.759 --> 00:39:53.759
greatest need. Most people today if you were to take polls and surveys they would talk

00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:59.399
about needs that are temporal things, that are temporal things. And there are people

00:39:59.399 --> 00:40:02.319
today that run around and try to meet temporal

00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:06.879
needs. And I'm not saying that we ought not care about people and try to help them with

00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:10.199
their temporal needs, but what I am saying is that if we don't ever tell somebody about

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:14.539
their greatest need and tell them how their greatest need could ever be met through Jesus

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:23.239
Christ, then we failed. We failed. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only one that could provide

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:29.479
reconciliation. Somebody said this, if our greatest need had been information, God would

00:40:29.479 --> 00:40:35.879
have sent us an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent

00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:42.159
us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, how many people think that in our world

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:48.799
today? Then God would have sent us an economist. If our greatest need had been pleasure, many

00:40:48.799 --> 00:40:56.239
that live that way today, God would have sent us an entertainer. But our greatest need was

00:40:56.239 --> 00:41:05.439
forgiveness. So God, He sent us a Savior. His name is Jesus. He's my shepherd. Notice

00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:13.719
what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5. We've read already in 1 Peter chapter

00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:22.359
number 3 where the Bible says in that portion of Scripture to bring us to God. That He might

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:29.559
bring us to God. That act of reconciliation, of redeeming us and reconciling us. And we

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:33.599
find here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, notice what the Bible says, and we're going

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:38.079
to begin reading in verse number 18 of 2 Corinthians chapter number 5. And the Bible says, actually

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:42.279
back up to verse number 14. In verse number 14 the Bible says, for the love of Christ

00:41:42.279 --> 00:41:49.839
constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:53.639
And so He's talking about Jesus Christ. He died for us. Remember, my shepherd, He died

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:58.839
for me. And that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto

00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:04.279
themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again. Wherefore, verse 16, henceforth

00:42:04.279 --> 00:42:08.279
know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet

00:42:08.279 --> 00:42:15.959
now henceforth know we Him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:42:15.959 --> 00:42:19.359
Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. I'm so thankful to be in

00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:25.359
Christ. I'm thankful for how God changed my life. He transformed me. He's going to talk

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:31.239
about salvation. Salvation is not reformation. It's transformation. It's not trying to clean

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:36.559
ourselves up, trying to become a better me. No, no. God transforms us. Why? Because He

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:41.279
quickens us. He makes us alive in the Holy Spirit of God and dwells us. And we find here,

00:42:41.279 --> 00:42:46.319
notice in verse number 18, and all things are of God who hath, notice what it says,

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:53.599
reconciled us to Himself, how? By Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:57.279
You know, for those of us that have been saved this morning, we're to live for Christ according

00:42:57.279 --> 00:43:02.759
to verse number 15, but we also notice that He's given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:07.599
Again, we understand that my shepherd provides for me the greatest need that I have, the

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:13.399
greatest need that every person I come into contact with is to be saved, reconciled. And

00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:19.239
He's given unto us the ministry of reconciliation. And we find, it says in 19, in verse 19,

00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:26.399
to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their

00:43:26.399 --> 00:43:32.799
trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, we

00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:39.479
are ambassadors for Christ. As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's

00:43:39.479 --> 00:43:47.439
stead, be ye reconciled to God. Notice verse number 21, for He hath made Him to be sin

00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:54.999
for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. Let me explain

00:43:54.999 --> 00:44:01.479
to you verse 21, many of you know it. God the Father made Him, God the Son, to be sin

00:44:01.479 --> 00:44:09.199
for us. He knew no sin, He's perfect, He's sinless, He's the just. But He took upon

00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:18.399
Himself the sin of the world and paid the awful penalty so that we might be made the

00:44:18.399 --> 00:44:24.919
righteousness of God in Him. See today, so many people are trying to be reconciled to

00:44:24.919 --> 00:44:30.799
God through some other means. But there are no other means. There's no other way to be

00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:35.119
reconciled to God. You say, but Pastor, I'm doing as good as I can do. I mean, I'm doing

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:41.599
all the good things that I know that I could do. You can't reconcile you to God. Because

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:48.959
the Bible says that we're not saved by works. We're not saved by works. For by grace are

00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:53.999
you saved through faith and not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest

00:44:53.999 --> 00:45:00.799
any man should boast. Paul said this in the book of Galatians, if righteousness came by

00:45:00.799 --> 00:45:13.079
the law, then Christ is dead in vain. My Savior, my Shepherd did not die in vain.

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:19.799
He had to die so that we could be reconciled. He provides for us. Listen, I'm thankful for

00:45:19.799 --> 00:45:24.599
all of His provision. I mean, He's been a good God. He's so good. He has provided to

00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:34.199
us more than we could even fully comprehend. But my greatest need is met through Jesus

00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:43.079
Christ, through my Shepherd. Your greatest need this morning is salvation. It's salvation

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:50.399
to have forgiveness of your sins, to know without any shadow of a doubt that heaven

00:45:50.399 --> 00:45:56.559
is your home. Not because of anything that you have done, because you can't do it. Because

00:45:56.559 --> 00:46:02.879
of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, His death, His burial, and His glorious resurrection.

00:46:02.879 --> 00:46:07.359
Listen, sometimes we go through life and people say, how are you doing? I was thinking about

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:10.759
this week. You know what I'm going to start saying, Ron? I'm going to start saying, my

00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:18.839
cup runneth over. I really am. I mean, with God's help, if I can remember, I'm going to

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:22.079
start telling people, Armando, my cup runneth over. And you know what people are going to

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:25.919
be living with, what does that mean? Maybe open a door for an opportunity to be able

00:46:25.919 --> 00:46:32.159
to share. Why? Because sometimes we go through life. I know Mr. Don, absolutely wonderful.

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:39.039
I mean, I visited Mr. Don in the hospital. And Mr. Regine, she's been there. I'll say,

00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:43.239
Don, how are you doing? He's laying in the hospital and he says, absolutely wonderful.

00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:50.839
And it's a blessing. But could I say that not everyone has that perspective? Sometimes

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:57.999
we go through life like, man, we just want to have a pity party. Things are so bad. No,

00:46:57.999 --> 00:47:09.319
no. As a child of God, my cup runneth over. It's not even just full. It runs over. I love

00:47:09.319 --> 00:47:17.759
the imagery. It runs over. I don't know who wrote the song, but Mike Clark sings the song,

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:27.679
I'm drinking from my saucer because my cup runs over. I like that. And this morning,

00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:33.519
why would I say, why should you say that my cup runneth over? Well, because my shepherd

00:47:33.519 --> 00:47:42.679
loves me. My shepherd loves me. My shepherd died for me. My shepherd found me. My shepherd,

00:47:42.679 --> 00:47:49.399
he cares about me. Number five, my shepherd, he provides for me. And he provided the greatest

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:55.159
need, the need of salvation. This morning, if you're not sure of heaven, I want to invite

00:47:55.159 --> 00:48:01.159
you to trust Christ today because your greatest need is salvation. This morning, if you've

00:48:01.159 --> 00:48:07.039
been saved and you can say with the psalmist, the Lord is my shepherd, I would say to you

00:48:07.039 --> 00:48:10.399
this morning, you should rejoice in that. You should be thankful in that. But you ought

00:48:10.399 --> 00:48:16.559
to understand that God said that he gives you the ministry of reconciliation. And he

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:25.419
said to us that we are ambassadors, representatives, his witnesses. And he has committed unto us

00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:31.019
this ministry, this word of reconciliation. This morning, we'll look at five more reasons

00:48:31.019 --> 00:48:36.739
tonight. I hope that you'd fill out a whole lot more reasons on why you should say and

00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:44.179
why I should say, my cup runneth over. Let's pray. Father, we love you. How we thank you

00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:52.339
for loving us. Lord, I thank you for the word of God, the truth that's contained therein.

00:48:52.339 --> 00:49:00.699
I thank you this morning for these five powerful truths. Lord, I know the list could go on

00:49:00.699 --> 00:49:11.099
and on and on. This morning, I hope that each of us would truly evaluate our lives and we

00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:14.539
would agree with the psalmist and we would echo the words of the psalmist and say, my

00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:23.979
cup runneth over. Not that we would just say it to say it, but that we would truly

00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:34.859
acknowledge the truth this morning that our cup runneth over. You've been so good to us.

00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:40.859
Father, if there's one here this morning that's never trusted Christ as their Savior, they're

00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:49.299
not sure of heaven. Maybe they've heard the message before, maybe they've sat in this

00:49:49.299 --> 00:49:58.779
church for years. They've never trusted Jesus as their Savior. They're trying to get to

00:49:58.779 --> 00:50:02.379
heaven through their own works, through some reason.

00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:09.299
religion. And I pray this morning the Holy Spirit would help them to understand there's

00:50:09.299 --> 00:50:18.139
only one way to get to heaven and his name is Jesus. I pray that for those that are here

00:50:18.139 --> 00:50:23.079
that are saved, they've trusted Christ as their Savior, they're heaven bound. God would

00:50:23.079 --> 00:50:29.219
you help us to take seriously the ministry of reconciliation that you have entrusted

00:50:29.219 --> 00:50:35.939
us with, that we would be good ambassadors, good representatives. God I pray that you

00:50:35.939 --> 00:50:41.799
would use us for your honor and for your glory. Help us to go through life as my cup runneth

00:50:41.799 --> 00:50:48.979
over Christians. Would you move and work in these moments of invitation as only you can.

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:53.379
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee and we'll thank you for it. In

00:50:53.379 --> 00:50:57.879
Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? At the end of each of our services we

00:50:57.879 --> 00:51:03.399
have a moment of invitation where we invite you to respond. We don't ever seek to embarrass

00:51:03.399 --> 00:51:10.439
anyone. We never call anybody out. But this morning maybe you don't know the shepherd.

00:51:10.439 --> 00:51:14.159
You've never been saved. Would you come so that we could take a Bible and show you how

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:19.519
you could know for sure that heaven is your home? I would beg you not to leave here without

00:51:19.519 --> 00:51:24.319
knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Maybe this morning you'd say, pastor I'm saved,

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:32.999
I've been born again, I know the shepherd. And I'm rejoicing because of it. This morning

00:51:32.999 --> 00:51:38.399
maybe you need to come and ask God to help you in the area of being an ambassador. The

00:51:38.399 --> 00:51:43.799
ministry of reconciliation that's been entrusted to each of us. Maybe this morning you want

00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:49.959
to come and just thank God. Just rejoice a little while on why your cup runneth over.

00:51:49.959 --> 00:51:51.799
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
