1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
I need a drink of water and I looked up and someone else is taking a drink of water, amen?

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,239
And praise the Lord.

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,600
Second Timothy chapter number one.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,719
And many countries around the world, around the globe, they have a day on their calendar

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,399
such as we're celebrating today, a day to honor mothers.

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,959
Now not every country celebrates it on the same day.

7
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,600
Various countries have various days that they have.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,119
Of course in the United States of America, the second Sunday of each May is set aside

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,200
on our calendar to celebrate mothers.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,979
And Woodrow Wilson said this in 1914 when he made his proclamation concerning the holiday.

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:52,360
He said, this holiday offers a chance to publicly express our love and reverence for the mothers

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,159
of our country.

13
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,680
And I agree with his sentiments and that which he shared in that proclamation.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,560
And I am thankful that we have such a day on our calendar.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,440
I mentioned already, of course, that I'm thankful for the opportunity to have my mom here.

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,839
And they've been traveling, they'll be traveling in this afternoon, but they made it back safely

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,239
last night and they're able to be here today.

18
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,360
And so we're thankful for that.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,959
And then Holly's mom being able to be here as well.

20
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,720
And we're thankful for the blessing, the uniqueness of that for today.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,400
As we study the word of God, we find there are many references throughout the scriptures

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,480
that deal with and teach us the importance of motherhood.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,319
In fact, we find there are many examples that God gives us through his word of those that

24
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,120
faithfully fulfilled the role of being a mom.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,760
As we look at this passage of scripture this morning, I really want to focus our attention

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,639
on the impact and influence, not only of a mother, but also of a grandmother in our text

27
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:57,000
of scripture and that impact and influence that they had on a faithful servant of the

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lord.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm thankful for Timothy and Timothy has a great testimony as you study the word of God

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,199
and you understand the role that Timothy played and how Paul would often refer to him as his

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,119
own son in the faith.

32
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:16,360
And he would speak of Timothy of being a man that had a good testimony, a man that was

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,080
honorable, a man that he could trust to send to churches to be able to encourage them and

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,679
equip them and bring back reports.

35
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:31,000
And Paul had great confidence in this man, Timothy.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,399
Of course, God would use Paul to write these two epistles, 1 and 2 Timothy, these letters

37
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,039
back to Timothy.

38
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,399
They're part of the canon of scripture.

39
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:46,119
And it's interesting here in 2 Timothy chapter one and verse number five, when Paul says

40
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:54,479
this, when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in

41
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:01,559
thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice, I am persuaded that in thee also.

42
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:06,199
As we look at this verse of scripture, it's very interesting because we see not only Timothy

43
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,399
being addressed, but we see that as Paul is speaking to Timothy, he's speaking not only

44
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:17,039
about or to Timothy, but he's speaking about his mother and his grandmother.

45
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,160
It's very interesting from a spiritual sense.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,800
We understand the importance of what Paul lays out in 2 Timothy two and verse number

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,880
two, perhaps on the same page of your Bible is where we are here in 2 Timothy one five.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,759
And it's in that verse of scripture that we understand the spiritual impact that every

49
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,880
child of God, every believer is to have.

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,679
And Paul says this to Timothy in that verse of scripture, in the things that thou hast

51
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:49,000
heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,839
to teach others also.

53
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:56,080
And we see that model for discipleship that is laid out in 2 Timothy two and verse number

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
two.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,119
But really we find that in the home is the greatest place for us to implement that model

56
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,240
that is spoken of in 2 Timothy two and verse number two.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,440
And I want to rejoice with you this morning that Timothy had a home where this principle

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,399
was practiced, was implemented.

59
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,160
And we've titled the message this morning, generational faith.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Generational faith.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,820
You know, the reality is that there are many people today that are desiring to pass down

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,679
a whole host of things to their children and to their grandchildren.

63
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:36,440
There are people that are working, that are seeking to, here's what the impression, this

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,519
is the legacy, this is the impact that I want to have upon my children and upon my children's

65
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,519
children.

66
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,260
And we think about the sphere of influence, and the reality this morning is that as a

67
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,559
child of God, we ought to have a desire that we would have generational faith, amen?

68
00:04:55,559 --> 00:05:00,880
That the reality that we have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior,

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,279
that we've desired to walk with God.

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,579
And as John would say, I have no greater joy than to know that my children walk in truth.

71
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,920
And that we would have that desire, that we'd have that focus, that not only do I want to

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,600
walk with God, but I want to see my children walk with God, and I want to see their children

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
walk with God.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,239
And you say, I don't have children.

75
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, the reality is that if you have no children this morning, the message is still for you,

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,040
because we have a responsibility to impact someone with the truth of the gospel.

77
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,440
And we have the responsibility of modeling and mentoring, and what a great responsibility

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,119
that is.

79
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:46,399
We find in our text of Scripture this morning this truth of generational faith.

80
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,320
I want you to consider with me, if you're taking notes this morning, notice first how

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,079
their faith is described.

82
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,119
It's interesting as we find again that he, Paul, he says, I call to remembrance.

83
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:03,839
And so, Paul, if you were to go back to Acts chapter number 16, you would read about Paul's

84
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,760
introduction to the family, and you would read about Timothy and his upbringing, and

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
so on and so forth.

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,579
And you would read of his mother, and you would read that she was a Jew and she believed.

87
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,600
And what joy it is to have a mother that believes the truth of the gospel.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,600
And we find that as Paul is speaking to Timothy, he says, I call to remembrance, but notice

89
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,359
how he describes the faith.

90
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:31,880
He doesn't just say, the faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother

91
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,480
Lois and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded in thee also.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,739
No, he says this, the unfeigned faith.

93
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,799
Every word of God is pure.

94
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,200
Every word is important.

95
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
There's no fillers.

96
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:51,679
And as we look at this word, unfeigned faith, and we notice how Paul is describing the faith

97
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:56,880
that he says first was in thy grandmother Lois, and then he says that it was in your

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,200
mother also Eunice, but it's in you, Timothy.

99
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,720
In this faith that I am calling to remembrance, this is unfeigned faith.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,760
This faith that Paul is speaking of is faith that is without dissimulation.

101
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,720
It is faith that is without hypocrisy.

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,500
It is faith that is not a counterfeit.

103
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,720
So how would we describe this faith?

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,000
We would say that the faith that Paul is calling to mind, that he's calling to remembrance,

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,519
the faith that he is speaking of when he's writing to Timothy here is a faith that was

106
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,519
real.

107
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,440
It was a faith that was sincere.

108
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,200
It was a faith that was modeled, that was seen, that Paul is able to describe it in

109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,040
this manner that it was genuine.

110
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,299
Now think about that.

111
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:53,600
The importance of our faith and how our faith would be described, not only how we would

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,320
describe our faith, but perhaps we could ask this morning, how would our children describe

113
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
our faith?

114
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,279
How would those observing us describe our faith?

115
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:09,079
But oh, most importantly, how would God describe my faith?

116
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,320
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,480
We read that in just a couple of chapters in this very book of the Bible, and we find

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,959
that as Paul is writing, it's not Paul that's just offering these accolades to this family.

119
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,440
It's not Paul that's trying to just puff them up.

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,279
No, it's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God that God Almighty describes

121
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,599
their faith as being unfeigned faith.

122
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm mindful of the series that we've had now for several months in our family Sunday

123
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,799
school class over in the fellowship hall looking at the miracles of the Lord Jesus

124
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,840
Christ.

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,359
And as you study the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ, obviously we have spoken many

126
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:56,320
times about the impact on our faith and the way that God wants us to believe that He's

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,380
able to do all things, that with Thee there's nothing that's impossible.

128
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,559
We find that as we've studied the miracles, that as we've come across some portions

129
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,039
of Scripture, we've heard the Lord Jesus Christ describe the faith of those that are

130
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,960
within the account as being great faith.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,719
At other times, we've read little faith.

132
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:28,919
On one particular occasion, He says, how is it that you have no faith?

133
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:35,440
And here as we consider the faith that is being described to us as Paul is calling this

134
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,479
to remembrance and he's speaking to Timothy, no doubt encouraging Timothy, he says, listen,

135
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:46,359
I know that this faith, it's real, it's genuine, it's sincere.

136
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:53,760
This morning, I think about the importance of what Timothy saw modeled in his presence.

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,359
I think of the importance of our children.

138
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:59,960
I think of the importance of a generation coming behind us that would...

139
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,880
see that we have unfeigned faith.

140
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,720
That our faith is genuine, that it's sincere,

141
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,360
that there's no hypocrisy, there's no counterfeit,

142
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,160
that we're not telling somebody else

143
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,920
in the time of their trouble, in the time of their struggle,

144
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,880
oh, trust God, but then when the storm comes in our lives,

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
we just fall apart.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
No, no, our faith is real.

147
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,320
My God is able.

148
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,640
My God is real.

149
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,200
And our children and a future generation,

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,080
they need to see that we have unfeigned faith.

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
We're being watched.

152
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,600
We've often said over the years that a mother's job is really

153
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,880
never over.

154
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,280
And some of you that have young children say amen and amen.

155
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,200
Some of you that have older children say amen and amen.

156
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
But the reality is the mother's job is never over.

157
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
You know, there's never a time really

158
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,720
when we're not being observed, not

159
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
being watched.

160
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
You remember the account of Moses

161
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
when he first was going to leave the palace

162
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,080
and he saw that Egyptian doing something wrong?

163
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
And the Bible tells us this.

164
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,480
He looked this way and he looked that way

165
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
and he thought no one was looking around

166
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
and then he took matters in his own hands.

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
You remember the text?

168
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,400
Sometimes we think no one's watching.

169
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
But what happened when Moses then

170
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,680
went to the two brethren that were arguing and disputing

171
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,280
and he tries to provide mediation between them?

172
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,440
What does he do?

173
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,520
They say, oh, are you going to kill us

174
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,020
like you killed that guy yesterday?

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
We're always being observed.

176
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,520
We're always being watched.

177
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,600
The reality is that as we're being watched,

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,720
as our lives are being observed, I

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,760
trust that our faith would be described

180
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,600
as being unfeigned faith, the real deal, the real thing.

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
It's not just a talk.

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,040
Someone said this, talk is cheap.

183
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,680
A certain way it is, isn't it?

184
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Our walk, that people see our faith,

185
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,840
it is described to us in this text of Scripture

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
as being unfeigned faith.

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,720
First, in thy grandmother Lois, but also in your mother Eunice

188
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,680
and in thee also Timothy, this generational faith.

189
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,000
What a blessing.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Not only do we see how this faith is described,

191
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,400
but I want you to consider with me how the faith is delivered.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,840
How the faith is delivered.

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,040
No doubt, as we would think about the description

194
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,120
of the faith of these, the mom and grandmother of Timothy,

195
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,840
no doubt their faith was lived out daily.

196
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,760
The reality is that the just shall live by faith.

197
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,480
That's what the word of God tells us.

198
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
And we think about living by faith

199
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,160
and we think about the truth of our faith.

200
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
We can say that we have faith,

201
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,840
but how does somebody see our faith?

202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,600
It's through our actions, it's through our behavior,

203
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,560
it's through living out our faith.

204
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
And we take those steps of faith

205
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,240
and we live out daily our faith.

206
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,120
And in addition to not only living out our faith

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,860
and being an example to those who are watching us,

208
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,600
I believe that there's some very purpose things

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,360
that we can do in order to ensure

210
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,960
that the faith is delivered, that it's delivered.

211
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,000
You're familiar with the text of scripture,

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
you don't need to turn there,

213
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,800
but in the single chapter book of Jude in verse number three,

214
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Jude says this, he says,

215
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,160
"'Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you

216
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,000
"'of the common salvation,

217
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,780
"'it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you

218
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,400
"'that you should earnestly contend for the faith.'"

219
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
And then he says this,

220
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,640
"'which was once delivered unto the saints.'"

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
And so we think about this faith

222
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,960
and we understand how the faith was described

223
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,480
as being unfeigned faith,

224
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
but when we think about this generational faith

225
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,400
and we consider the grandmother and the mother

226
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,920
and now Timothy as the one being spoken to,

227
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,640
I say this morning, the faith is delivered.

228
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,620
It's not only described to us and defined to us

229
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,920
as being unfeigned faith, but it's delivered.

230
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,200
And how is it that I can deliver this faith

231
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
to a future generation?

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,900
How is it that I can deliver my faith to my children?

233
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,880
Just a few simple thoughts this morning.

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Number one, I would say this, we need to be intentional.

235
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,800
Be intentional.

236
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,600
In other words, could I say it this way, develop a plan.

237
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,960
Someone said this, if you have no plan,

238
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,320
then you plan to fail.

239
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,720
There's some truth to that.

240
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,040
And as we consider the importance, I believe this morning,

241
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,560
that as we desire to be intentional,

242
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,480
that as we develop a plan,

243
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,920
then as we seek to stick to that plan,

244
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,440
that we could see how that we can deliver a faith,

245
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,280
our faith, an unfeigned faith to a future generation.

246
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,600
I think of this when we're talking about being intentional

247
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,320
and developing a plan.

248
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,040
We live in a time in which busyness

249
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,600
is something that describes many of our schedules.

250
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,520
Is it not?

251
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,880
Busyness is an obstacle for every one of us.

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
But can I tell you this morning that busyness

253
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
is an obstacle that must be overcome.

254
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,560
Busyness cannot prevent us from investing

255
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,060
in what is most important in the lives

256
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,600
of those that are observing us.

257
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,680
Sometimes we just get too so busy in life.

258
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,840
And that busyness is an obstacle.

259
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,760
Listen, I believe with all my heart

260
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,660
that the enemy wants to make us busy.

261
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,680
He wants to keep us busy,

262
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,400
distract it with all sorts of maybe even good things

263
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,360
and keeping us from the best thing.

264
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,440
I understand that we have many responsibilities

265
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,520
and we have many things that have to be fulfilled

266
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,920
in our lives, but the reality is that God has entrusted

267
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,600
to us a responsibility to a future generation.

268
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
If you have children this morning,

269
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,920
if God has blessed you with children,

270
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,920
you have a very important role and responsibility

271
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,960
on delivering an unfeigned faith to your children.

272
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
I want you to think about this as I've spoken

273
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,540
about being intentional and developing a plan.

274
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,560
Turn over to 2 Timothy 3 if you will.

275
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,040
And I want you to notice the truth of verse number 15.

276
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,280
In light of what we've seen in verse number five

277
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,120
of chapter number one, when Paul says to Timothy,

278
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,040
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith

279
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,480
that is in thee, but he says this,

280
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,600
which first, it dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois

281
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,240
and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also.

282
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
And we come to the third chapter

283
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,800
and we read in verse number 15,

284
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,800
that the Bible says, and that from a child

285
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,480
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures.

286
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,560
That from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

287
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,520
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

288
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,940
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

289
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,640
I think about the truth of this verse of Scripture,

290
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
the importance of the children learning the word of God

291
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,960
and the home and what a great responsibility

292
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
that is ours to diligently teach our children

293
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,140
to be intentional, to develop a plan,

294
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,340
to desire to deliver our faith to our descendants,

295
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,080
to those that are observing us.

296
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,120
And we think about the truth of this passage of Scripture,

297
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,240
the Bible says that from a child thou has known

298
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,860
the Holy Scriptures, but I want you to understand

299
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,900
this morning that knowing the Holy Scriptures

300
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,340
isn't just about having some body of knowledge,

301
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,820
it's not just about being able to rehearse

302
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,580
some number of facts and being able to say,

303
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,540
here are the tribes of Israel

304
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,420
and here are the kings of Israel

305
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,740
and here are the kings of Judah

306
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,260
and here are the books of the Bible

307
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,020
and here's the, and it's just a bunch of knowledge.

308
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,900
No, the truth of the Scripture in the very next verse,

309
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,340
it says that God's word, all Scripture is given

310
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,180
by inspiration of God and it says this, and is profitable.

311
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,140
And I want you to notice that in verse number 15,

312
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,840
the greatest, the most significant profit that we have

313
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,340
as we look to the word of God is that it says this,

314
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,340
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

315
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,020
Wow, I am so thankful that this Bible

316
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,860
that we hold in our hands contains within the pages thereof

317
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,420
the truth of the Gospel.

318
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,740
William Scroggie described the Bible this way,

319
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,220
it is the unfolding drama of redemption.

320
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,220
And I love that description of the Bible.

321
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,860
And as you look at the truth of redemption

322
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,820
throughout the Scriptures and you understand

323
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,059
the plan of redemption as it's set forth

324
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,780
in Ephesians chapter number one,

325
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,100
that before the very foundation of the world,

326
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,780
God Almighty knew that man was going to sin.

327
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,940
He knew that sin was going to enter

328
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,600
through the trespass of Adam and Eve in Genesis three.

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,460
He knew that and he developed a plan.

330
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,900
Genesis, or Ephesians chapter number one

331
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,020
is not describing for us or discussing to us

332
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,780
the who of salvation.

333
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,300
Ephesians chapter number one is revealing to us

334
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,940
the how of salvation that God determined

335
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,100
before the foundation of the world

336
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,580
that the only way for mankind to be saved,

337
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,500
to be redeemed is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

338
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,059
His death, burial and glorious resurrection

339
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,700
on the, that is the Gospel.

340
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,580
And as we understand his substitutionary atonement,

341
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,660
his glorious resurrection, we can rest in having

342
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,179
the knowledge that through the Scriptures,

343
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,140
they are able to make us wise unto salvation

344
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,780
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

345
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,580
what glorious message the Bible contains.

346
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,980
Paul said this, he said, it's a truth,

347
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,680
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

348
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,660
that Christ Jesus came into the world,

349
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,780
for what purpose?

350
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,180
To save sinners.

351
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,540
And then he says, of whom I am chief.

352
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,860
This morning, there is a universal condition amongst mankind

353
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,060
and that universal condition is one of sin.

354
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
The Bible tells us that all have sinned

355
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,780
and come short of the glory of God.

356
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,540
There's not one person other than the Lord Jesus Christ

357
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,380
that's ever walked upon this face of the earth

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
that's been without sin.

359
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,980
And with that universal condition that mankind has sinned,

360
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,740
they have offended a holy God,

361
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,740
they have broken his law and the consequence is death.

362
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,340
But as we sang this morning about our Savior's love,

363
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,100
oh, how marvelous, amen?

364
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,100
It's amazing love that God so loved the world

365
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,540
that he gave his only begotten Son.

366
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,380
Why?

367
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,220
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish

368
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,700
but have everlasting life.

369
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,660
Jesus Christ himself said, I am the way,

370
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,060
the truth and the life.

371
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,940
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

372
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,820
Peter would stand with great boldness

373
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,060
as he was questioned by the religious leaders

374
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,260
in Acts chapter number four

375
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,900
and they were questioning about the miracle

376
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,420
of Acts chapter number three

377
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,540
and they were saying that it was perhaps in his own power.

378
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,180
And he said, listen, let it be known

379
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,120
that this is not in my power,

380
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,780
that this man has been made whole.

381
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,980
It's through the power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

382
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,920
And then he says this,

383
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,260
neither is there salvation in any other.

384
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,020
There's no other name under heaven given among men

385
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,220
whereby we must be saved.

386
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,300
This morning, when we think about delivering

387
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,500
this faith that we're speaking of this morning,

388
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,180
this generational faith,

389
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,820
can I tell you this morning the greatest impact

390
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
that we could have on this next generation,

391
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,240
on those that are observing us,

392
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,540
is that they would understand

393
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,380
that the gospel of Jesus Christ through the word of God.

394
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,780
We have God's word, we have the authority.

395
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,580
And mankind needs to be redeemed.

396
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,420
And here Paul says that from a child

397
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,380
thou hast known the holy scriptures

398
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,660
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

399
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,540
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

400
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,220
That phrase when he says through faith,

401
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,440
many today have this misunderstanding.

402
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,820
Some very sincere,

403
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,140
believing that they can do good things to get to heaven.

404
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,060
And if I could just be good enough,

405
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,940
if I could just do enough good things,

406
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,260
if at the end of it all, if there's a giant scale

407
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,500
and there's more on this side than on that side,

408
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,740
then I'll be okay.

409
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,500
That's just not what the Bible teaches.

410
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,660
It's through faith.

411
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,260
In fact, in Ephesians 2, in verses eight and nine,

412
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,340
he says, for by grace are you saved through faith.

413
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,660
And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

414
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,980
not of works, lest any man should boast.

415
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,620
By the way, I've often thought

416
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,380
how difficult of a life it would be to live daily,

417
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,820
wondering from moment to moment

418
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,700
if I've done enough good to get to heaven.

419
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,420
And at some level, I become the standard

420
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,260
or the authority for determining

421
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,820
whether I've done enough good.

422
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,620
And then if I do something really bad,

423
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,380
how many good things does it cancel out?

424
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,460
It's a really challenging way to live.

425
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,740
And I'm thankful that God says,

426
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,060
it's not of works, it's a gift.

427
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,540
And I paid for this gift

428
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,900
with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

429
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,380
Man, what a gift.

430
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,740
And Paul says to Timothy, that's what you learn.

431
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,700
You learn the scriptures and the scriptures

432
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,180
are able to make you wise unto salvation.

433
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,380
We pray for the children in our church

434
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,020
that they'd be saved.

435
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,220
I pray for the children in our church

436
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,020
that they'd be saved at a young age

437
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,700
so that they would have a life of service to the master.

438
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,540
D.L. Moody was asked one day after a meeting

439
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,100
if anyone trusted Christ as their savior

440
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,820
on that particular day in that meeting.

441
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,220
And he said, two and a half.

442
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,020
And they said, oh, two adults and one child.

443
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,540
He said, no, two children and one adult.

444
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
He said, because the children have their whole life

445
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,260
to live for Jesus.

446
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
I like that perspective.

447
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,780
Here this morning, we have some children in our church

448
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,620
that have been saved.

449
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,460
We have some children in our church

450
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,900
that haven't been saved

451
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,260
and we need to pray for their salvation.

452
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,140
And we know that as we teach them the word of God,

453
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,780
listen, it's not so they can just stand up

454
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,860
and tell us about Noah and Moses

455
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,620
and tell us about Jonah and David and Goliath

456
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,580
and all of these stories.

457
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,740
No, the scriptures, the word of God is given to us,

458
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,180
yes, to provide us with historical account

459
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,020
and so on and so forth,

460
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,700
but the most important profit that we have

461
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,860
in the word of God is that it's through the pages

462
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,540
of this book that we learn the truth of salvation.

463
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,900
And what a joy, what a joy.

464
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,220
I said, number one, be intentional.

465
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,580
Number two, could I say this?

466
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,580
How am I going to deliver my faith to a future generation,

467
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,900
not only to be intentional to develop a plan,

468
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,820
but I would say this, be consistent.

469
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,420
You know, consistency is a challenge.

470
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,180
It really is, because there are some days

471
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,340
that we just feel like it'd be nice if I could have off.

472
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,220
You ever feel that way?

473
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Man, it'd just be nice to be off today.

474
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,220
Consistency, it's key.

475
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
You know, I've learned in my own life,

476
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,780
Holly and I have learned as parents,

477
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,400
the key of consistency.

478
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,540
I can't tell you that I've mastered it,

479
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,440
but I've learned the importance of it.

480
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,340
It's not just something that I've learned through experience

481
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,180
but it's something that we learn through the scriptures.

482
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,260
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will.

483
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,260
And I want you to see what is said is God

484
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,500
is preparing his people to enter into the land of promise

485
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,860
and he's giving, in the book of Deuteronomy,

486
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,860
these pieces of instruction in order for his people

487
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,440
to be prepared, he's using Moses.

488
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,580
Of course, Moses would not be permitted

489
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,260
to lead the children of Israel into the land of promise.

490
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,260
It would be Joshua who would have that responsibility.

491
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,820
But it's Moses that is used here in the book of Deuteronomy

492
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,920
to provide the nation with all of the instruction

493
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,300
and really rehearsing the law

494
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,980
and all that is necessary for the people to hear

495
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
and to know.

496
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,020
And I want you to see what he says in Deuteronomy 6

497
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,940
in verse number six.

498
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,340
Notice he says this,

499
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,460
and these words which I command thee this day

500
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,160
shall be in thine heart.

501
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,780
And thou shalt teach them,

502
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,020
notice that next word, diligently, unto thy children

503
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,520
and shalt talk of them when,

504
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,940
when thou sittest in thine house,

505
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,300
when thou walkest by the way,

506
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,620
when thou liest down and when thou risest up.

507
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,740
Not only should you share these things,

508
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,980
teach these things to your children when you're sitting

509
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,420
and when you're walking and when you lie down

510
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,260
and when you rise up,

511
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,660
but then he says this in verse eight,

512
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,700
thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand

513
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,940
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes

514
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,580
and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house

515
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
and upon thy gates.

516
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,120
I like scripture versus being in the house.

517
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,660
I like scripture versus being visible, why?

518
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,700
Because we're reminded of the importance of scripture,

519
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,820
the words of God, the importance of teaching our children.

520
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,380
And the reality is that there may be some time

521
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,540
that in our developing our plan and being intentional

522
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,860
that we have sit down instruction,

523
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,780
but then as we live our lives,

524
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,980
that we are living out the scriptures.

525
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,220
In this text of scripture in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

526
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,100
it's very interesting because the reality

527
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,700
is that the responsibility to teach them diligently

528
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,780
is given in verse number seven as we've read already,

529
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,180
but the reality is that the responsibility first

530
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,900
was to them to personally obey

531
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,220
and do what the scriptures taught.

532
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,260
And after you have obeyed and you've implemented

533
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,460
the truth of God's word in your own life,

534
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,300
then you teach it diligently unto thy child,

535
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,220
unto thy children.

536
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,980
Not only teaching an instructional form,

537
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,800
going through some devotional book or whatever it may be,

538
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,000
but also teaching through our lives.

539
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,340
As we're observed,

540
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,500
people should see us living out biblical truth, amen?

541
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,180
They should see in our lives

542
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,480
that we're living out our faith.

543
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,700
That it's not compartmentalized,

544
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,700
it's not some kind of secular and sacred

545
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,900
that we've made these compartments in our lives.

546
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,300
No, I belong to Jesus and I am His and He is mine

547
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,540
and this is my faith and I'm going to live my faith.

548
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,300
What a joy, what a blessing and we're to be consistent.

549
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,420
Let me say this as we would consider

550
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,100
how the faith is delivered.

551
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,180
Let me say this, guard against evil influences.

552
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,820
We need to be willing to fight for the next generation.

553
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,800
Seriously.

554
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,940
We need to guard against the evil influences.

555
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,340
You need to have a desire to fight for your kids,

556
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,460
to fight for those within our church.

557
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,460
You say, I don't have any children at home.

558
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,900
Yeah, but there's some kids in our church that are watching you, and they need to see

559
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,740
in you that your faith is real.

560
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,740
They need to see in Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so that they have faith, they believe God.

561
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,460
It's real to them.

562
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,620
We guard against these evil influences.

563
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,300
You understand that the world is coming after your kids.

564
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,700
The world is coming after the next generation.

565
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,300
And I tell you, with each passing day, it's becoming clearer and clearer that that is

566
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,340
their plan.

567
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:40,600
What has been for a period of time, generations in fact, disguised and covered up, is really

568
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,580
just being put straight in our face as to what the plan is for them to take the next

569
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,660
generation.

570
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,060
We need to understand that the next generation is worth fighting for.

571
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,460
Do you believe that this morning?

572
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,740
The next generation is worth fighting for.

573
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,500
The generational faith, we understand the faith that was once delivered, but here's

574
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,380
what Jude said, that you would earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto

575
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,300
the saints.

576
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,860
And we know as we study church history, as we study the history of how the gospel got

577
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:25,380
to us, that there were some people that have gone before us that understood the next generation

578
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,140
was worth fighting for.

579
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:38,280
There are many that we can study through church history that laid down their lives so that

580
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,080
we might have the truth of the gospel.

581
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,220
They sacrificed greatly so that a future generation would have a Bible.

582
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,180
We have this responsibility to guard against evil influences.

583
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,100
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

584
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:02,500
In 1 Corinthians chapter number 15, 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, I actually preached

585
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,480
a message just from this verse of Scripture a few months ago when we did on a Wednesday

586
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,340
night series, Be Not Deceived.

587
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,220
I did that for several weeks, a series.

588
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,740
And I actually titled the message, if you'd want to listen to it, I believe it's on our

589
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
website.

590
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,220
I titled the message from 1 Corinthians 15, 33, Spiritual Distancing.

591
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,220
We heard so many times in the last two years this thing of social distancing, right?

592
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,460
I need to social distance from you because I don't want to get this virus, right?

593
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,060
We heard that over and over and over.

594
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:46,780
And as I heard that so many times, the Lord impressed upon my heart the reality as Bible-believing

595
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,820
disciples of Jesus Christ that we need to have spiritual distancing.

596
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,740
He said, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

597
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Amen?

598
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,980
He says, as you study the Old Testament, that there's to be a difference.

599
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,740
We see in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, notice what Paul says under the inspiration

600
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,980
of the Holy Spirit of God.

601
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,940
He says, be not deceived.

602
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,140
Now, if a verse of Scripture starts with those words, we ought to pay close attention, don't

603
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,620
you agree?

604
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,140
Because the reality is the verse of Scripture starts with those words.

605
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:28,140
It's like, okay, so this could be something I could easily be deceived by, right?

606
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,060
Remember in Galatians 6, be not deceived.

607
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
God is not mocked.

608
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,420
What sort of man soweth, that shall he also reap.

609
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,820
How many people have lived their lives thinking, being deceived by that thought that I can

610
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:46,540
sow all sorts of wild, ungodly seed, and I'm not going to reap that kind of a harvest?

611
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Countless people.

612
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:54,020
A theologian of yesteryear, in fact, a preacher of yesteryear, a couple of hundred years ago,

613
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
actually.

614
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,300
He's preaching to the people then, and he says, you guys are out sowing bad seed six

615
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,540
days a week, and you come to church on Sunday and pray for crop failure.

616
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,660
That was 200 years ago that he said that.

617
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
What about today?

618
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,340
But God said, be not deceived.

619
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,460
Here we read those words, be not deceived.

620
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,260
Man, my antenna goes up.

621
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,860
We always should have that approach as we go to the Word of God that I ought to be fully

622
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,300
engaged and I ought to be ready to receive something from the Word of God.

623
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,860
But when he says, be not deceived, it's kind of like that beware sign, right?

624
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
That caution.

625
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,460
We spoke on Thursday night in our men's meeting about warnings and learning to appreciate

626
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
warnings.

627
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,060
Listen, when I go out door knocking and I see a sign that says, beware of dog, I'm taking

628
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:47,220
note, man, because I don't want to be bit, and I don't want to hurt their dog.

629
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,300
You understand what I'm saying?

630
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,260
And so when I see a sign that says, beware of dog, I'm very cautious.

631
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,140
And we see here that he says, be not deceived.

632
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:11,180
Look what he says, evil communications corrupt good manners.

633
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:18,900
I can go there, I can do this, I can watch that, I can read this, I can listen to that,

634
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,300
and it's not going to affect me.

635
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,140
Be not deceived.

636
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,100
I think about delivering our faith to a future generation.

637
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,820
We need to guard against the evil influences.

638
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:40,480
I think about the evil influences of TV.

639
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:51,140
You know that in some of the shows that they're playing for these young kids today, I'm talking

640
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,420
about toddler-age kids.

641
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:03,580
They're sending messages through those movies, through those videos, through those series.

642
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:13,020
You'd be surprised as to how they're undermining what you're trying to teach your children.

643
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,180
They're being exposed to these evil influences, and they're beginning to walk away thinking

644
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,780
these things are normal, that these things are acceptable, that these things are appropriate.

645
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,620
And then all of a sudden, because they've been watching these series of cartoons and

646
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,300
these shows, and they're being exposed to all of this thing, and then we try to teach

647
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
them the Bible, and they're like, what are you talking about?

648
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,300
TV, we need to be careful.

649
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:53,060
School, friends, music, magazines, books, and we can just go on and on and on, and think

650
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,180
about those evil influences.

651
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:01,420
Listen, we understand this evening that we have an enemy, we have an enemy, and our enemy

652
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,540
wants to devour to destroy us, but we understand this morning that the enemy wants to devour

653
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,180
and destroy a future generation.

654
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,660
He wants to destroy your kids.

655
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:19,340
I don't think there's one amongst us that if someone came to you and said, there's this

656
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,580
person, here's who they are, and they describe, they identify the individual, and they say

657
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:32,820
to you that that individual wants to destroy the people that are closest to you physically,

658
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,100
that there are some things you would do.

659
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,540
There's some action you would take.

660
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,700
There's some preparation that you would go through, right?

661
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,220
Because you know of a real threat, and you say, no, no, that's my spouse, that's my child,

662
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,320
that's my parent, that's my...

663
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,660
The enemy wants to destroy you, and he wants to destroy your kids.

664
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,620
The generation in our church, you say, I don't have any kids at home anymore, pastor.

665
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,900
We got kids in our church, they just sang right here.

666
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,220
We got kids down in the nursery right now this morning, kids that are sitting here.

667
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,380
Not only does Satan want to destroy me, but he wants to destroy these kids.

668
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,580
And we need to guard against those evil influences, and we need to be careful to understand that

669
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,660
the Word of God says, be not deceived.

670
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,540
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

671
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,860
I remember Palmer Sean said this several years ago, we had a family conference, and he said

672
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,500
that when he was raising their only daughter, Jennifer, I believe is her name, that he was

673
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:48,140
criticized because he wanted to take part in picking her friends, and he was criticized

674
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
for that.

675
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,020
And he said, listen, I have a responsibility.

676
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,179
I have a responsibility, and I'm going to know who my daughter's friends are.

677
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:03,740
And I'm going to be involved and engaged, and I'm going to be, I'm going to be present.

678
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,540
I'm going to know what's going on.

679
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,820
This morning, as we look at this generational faith, Paul is writing to Timothy, and he

680
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,420
says, Timothy, when I call to remembrance the faith that is in thee, but he says it's

681
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,460
not just the faith, it's the unfeigned faith.

682
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,900
He describes it as being a faith that is without pretense.

683
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,100
There's no hypocrisy.

684
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,580
There's no dissimulation.

685
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,660
It's not counterfeit.

686
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
It is genuine.

687
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,380
It is the real deal.

688
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,059
He says, this faith that I recall, that I see in you, but it was first in your grandmother

689
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:43,500
and it was in your mother.

690
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,500
He said, man, I'm rejoicing in this because it's unfeigned faith.

691
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:54,540
Oh, that our faith would be described as being real.

692
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,059
Then as we consider the description, we must consider how is that faith delivered?

693
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:00,500
How do we...

694
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,360
How do we get it to the next generation?

695
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,939
There is a responsibility on the part of the next generation to take the baton.

696
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:14,619
I cannot pretend this morning that that's not true.

697
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,659
They have to be willing to receive it, but, oh, that it would never be said that we didn't

698
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:28,180
deliver it, amen, that we would do everything in our power, simple thoughts, be intentional,

699
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:37,020
develop a plan, don't allow busyness to be an obstacle that prevents us, rather an obstacle

700
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:47,819
that must be overcome, be consistent, be consistent, and then guard against evil influences.

701
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:53,220
If we do those things, I believe it will go a long way to helping us deliver that unfamed

702
00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,939
faith to a future generation, because what we need is we need generational faith, amen?

703
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:01,939
Let's pray together.

704
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,580
Father, we love You.

705
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,779
We thank You for loving us.

706
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:11,819
We thank You for the testimony of Timothy, and so often we read the Scriptures and we

707
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:16,540
read about Timothy and the ministries in which he's involved in and the work in which he's

708
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,459
engaged in, and we can rejoice in how You used him as a faithful servant of the Lord.

709
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:37,940
But as we come to this passage of Scripture, we're reminded about a mom and a grandmom,

710
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,660
this generational faith, this unfamed faith.

711
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:46,980
God, I pray that our faith would be described that way.

712
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,620
We're thankful that as it was delivered, that from a child, Timothy knew the Scriptures

713
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,260
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

714
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,580
Perhaps this morning, Lord, there's someone that's never trusted Christ as their Savior.

715
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:11,119
They're trying everything they can do to get to heaven on their own.

716
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,399
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would take the truth of the Word of God and convince

717
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:25,399
the one that might be lost here this morning of their need for salvation, that it's not

718
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:31,759
by works of righteousness which we have done, but it's according to His mercy He hath begotten

719
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:38,440
us, that we're saved by faith, by grace through faith.

720
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,919
It's not of works.

721
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:45,559
Oh, God, if there's someone here this morning not saved, would You help them to desire to

722
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:48,000
have that settled?

723
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,440
They would know for sure that heaven is their home.

724
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,320
For every child of God, whether we have children at home or not, I pray that You'd help us

725
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:06,360
to understand this morning the importance of influence, having an impact, having generational

726
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,119
faith.

727
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:16,240
Our children, our children's children, the children in our church, that if You do not

728
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,399
come in the next generation, that there'd be a church that would still stand on this

729
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:30,440
very place preaching the same very Word of God, we'd see generational faith.

730
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,839
Would You move and work in hearts and lives as only You can?

731
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:38,360
We'll give You the glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

732
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,960
Would you stand with me?

733
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,800
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around this morning.

734
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,320
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you could know

735
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,559
for sure that heaven is your home.

736
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,279
Perhaps this morning you want to come to this altar and pray for your kids.

737
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:56,039
Maybe this morning we need some people to come to this altar and pray for the kids in

738
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:03,399
our church, that we deliver unfeigned faith to a future generation.

739
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:05,919
As Miss Jackie plays on the piano, the altar is open.
