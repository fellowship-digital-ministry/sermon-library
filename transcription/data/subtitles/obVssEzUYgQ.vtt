WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.520
I need a drink of water and I looked up and someone else is taking a drink of water, amen?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.239
And praise the Lord.

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.600
Second Timothy chapter number one.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.719
And many countries around the world, around the globe, they have a day on their calendar

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.399
such as we're celebrating today, a day to honor mothers.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.959
Now not every country celebrates it on the same day.

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.600
Various countries have various days that they have.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.119
Of course in the United States of America, the second Sunday of each May is set aside

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.200
on our calendar to celebrate mothers.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.979
And Woodrow Wilson said this in 1914 when he made his proclamation concerning the holiday.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:52.360
He said, this holiday offers a chance to publicly express our love and reverence for the mothers

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.159
of our country.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.680
And I agree with his sentiments and that which he shared in that proclamation.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.560
And I am thankful that we have such a day on our calendar.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.440
I mentioned already, of course, that I'm thankful for the opportunity to have my mom here.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.839
And they've been traveling, they'll be traveling in this afternoon, but they made it back safely

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.239
last night and they're able to be here today.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:16.360
And so we're thankful for that.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.959
And then Holly's mom being able to be here as well.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.720
And we're thankful for the blessing, the uniqueness of that for today.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.400
As we study the word of God, we find there are many references throughout the scriptures

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.480
that deal with and teach us the importance of motherhood.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.319
In fact, we find there are many examples that God gives us through his word of those that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.120
faithfully fulfilled the role of being a mom.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.760
As we look at this passage of scripture this morning, I really want to focus our attention

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.639
on the impact and influence, not only of a mother, but also of a grandmother in our text

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:57.000
of scripture and that impact and influence that they had on a faithful servant of the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Lord.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.680
I'm thankful for Timothy and Timothy has a great testimony as you study the word of God

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.199
and you understand the role that Timothy played and how Paul would often refer to him as his

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.119
own son in the faith.

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:16.360
And he would speak of Timothy of being a man that had a good testimony, a man that was

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.080
honorable, a man that he could trust to send to churches to be able to encourage them and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.679
equip them and bring back reports.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:31.000
And Paul had great confidence in this man, Timothy.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.399
Of course, God would use Paul to write these two epistles, 1 and 2 Timothy, these letters

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.039
back to Timothy.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.399
They're part of the canon of scripture.

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.119
And it's interesting here in 2 Timothy chapter one and verse number five, when Paul says

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:54.479
this, when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in

00:02:54.479 --> 00:03:01.559
thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice, I am persuaded that in thee also.

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.199
As we look at this verse of scripture, it's very interesting because we see not only Timothy

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:11.399
being addressed, but we see that as Paul is speaking to Timothy, he's speaking not only

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:17.039
about or to Timothy, but he's speaking about his mother and his grandmother.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.160
It's very interesting from a spiritual sense.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.800
We understand the importance of what Paul lays out in 2 Timothy two and verse number

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.880
two, perhaps on the same page of your Bible is where we are here in 2 Timothy one five.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.759
And it's in that verse of scripture that we understand the spiritual impact that every

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.880
child of God, every believer is to have.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.679
And Paul says this to Timothy in that verse of scripture, in the things that thou hast

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:49.000
heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.839
to teach others also.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.080
And we see that model for discipleship that is laid out in 2 Timothy two and verse number

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.080
two.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.119
But really we find that in the home is the greatest place for us to implement that model

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.240
that is spoken of in 2 Timothy two and verse number two.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.440
And I want to rejoice with you this morning that Timothy had a home where this principle

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.399
was practiced, was implemented.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:22.160
And we've titled the message this morning, generational faith.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Generational faith.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.820
You know, the reality is that there are many people today that are desiring to pass down

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.679
a whole host of things to their children and to their grandchildren.

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:36.440
There are people that are working, that are seeking to, here's what the impression, this

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.519
is the legacy, this is the impact that I want to have upon my children and upon my children's

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.519
children.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:48.260
And we think about the sphere of influence, and the reality this morning is that as a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.559
child of God, we ought to have a desire that we would have generational faith, amen?

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.880
That the reality that we have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.279
that we've desired to walk with God.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.579
And as John would say, I have no greater joy than to know that my children walk in truth.

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.920
And that we would have that desire, that we'd have that focus, that not only do I want to

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.600
walk with God, but I want to see my children walk with God, and I want to see their children

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600
walk with God.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.239
And you say, I don't have children.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:27.600
Well, the reality is that if you have no children this morning, the message is still for you,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.040
because we have a responsibility to impact someone with the truth of the gospel.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.440
And we have the responsibility of modeling and mentoring, and what a great responsibility

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.119
that is.

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:46.399
We find in our text of Scripture this morning this truth of generational faith.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.320
I want you to consider with me, if you're taking notes this morning, notice first how

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.079
their faith is described.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:58.119
It's interesting as we find again that he, Paul, he says, I call to remembrance.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:03.839
And so, Paul, if you were to go back to Acts chapter number 16, you would read about Paul's

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:08.760
introduction to the family, and you would read about Timothy and his upbringing, and

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760
so on and so forth.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.579
And you would read of his mother, and you would read that she was a Jew and she believed.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:19.600
And what joy it is to have a mother that believes the truth of the gospel.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.600
And we find that as Paul is speaking to Timothy, he says, I call to remembrance, but notice

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.359
how he describes the faith.

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:31.880
He doesn't just say, the faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.480
Lois and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded in thee also.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.739
No, he says this, the unfeigned faith.

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:42.799
Every word of God is pure.

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:44.200
Every word is important.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200
There's no fillers.

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:51.679
And as we look at this word, unfeigned faith, and we notice how Paul is describing the faith

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:56.880
that he says first was in thy grandmother Lois, and then he says that it was in your

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.200
mother also Eunice, but it's in you, Timothy.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.720
In this faith that I am calling to remembrance, this is unfeigned faith.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.760
This faith that Paul is speaking of is faith that is without dissimulation.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.720
It is faith that is without hypocrisy.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.500
It is faith that is not a counterfeit.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.720
So how would we describe this faith?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.000
We would say that the faith that Paul is calling to mind, that he's calling to remembrance,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.519
the faith that he is speaking of when he's writing to Timothy here is a faith that was

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.519
real.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:36.440
It was a faith that was sincere.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.200
It was a faith that was modeled, that was seen, that Paul is able to describe it in

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.040
this manner that it was genuine.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.299
Now think about that.

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:53.600
The importance of our faith and how our faith would be described, not only how we would

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.320
describe our faith, but perhaps we could ask this morning, how would our children describe

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320
our faith?

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.279
How would those observing us describe our faith?

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:09.079
But oh, most importantly, how would God describe my faith?

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:11.320
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.480
We read that in just a couple of chapters in this very book of the Bible, and we find

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.959
that as Paul is writing, it's not Paul that's just offering these accolades to this family.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.440
It's not Paul that's trying to just puff them up.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.279
No, it's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God that God Almighty describes

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:34.599
their faith as being unfeigned faith.

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:40.320
I'm mindful of the series that we've had now for several months in our family Sunday

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.799
school class over in the fellowship hall looking at the miracles of the Lord Jesus

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:45.840
Christ.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.359
And as you study the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ, obviously we have spoken many

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:56.320
times about the impact on our faith and the way that God wants us to believe that He's

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.380
able to do all things, that with Thee there's nothing that's impossible.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.559
We find that as we've studied the miracles, that as we've come across some portions

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:11.039
of Scripture, we've heard the Lord Jesus Christ describe the faith of those that are

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:14.960
within the account as being great faith.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.719
At other times, we've read little faith.

00:09:22.719 --> 00:09:28.919
On one particular occasion, He says, how is it that you have no faith?

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:35.440
And here as we consider the faith that is being described to us as Paul is calling this

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.479
to remembrance and he's speaking to Timothy, no doubt encouraging Timothy, he says, listen,

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:46.359
I know that this faith, it's real, it's genuine, it's sincere.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:53.760
This morning, I think about the importance of what Timothy saw modeled in his presence.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.359
I think of the importance of our children.

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:59.960
I think of the importance of a generation coming behind us that would...

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.880
see that we have unfeigned faith.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.720
That our faith is genuine, that it's sincere,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.360
that there's no hypocrisy, there's no counterfeit,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.160
that we're not telling somebody else

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.920
in the time of their trouble, in the time of their struggle,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.880
oh, trust God, but then when the storm comes in our lives,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.000
we just fall apart.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.840
No, no, our faith is real.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.320
My God is able.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.640
My God is real.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.200
And our children and a future generation,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.080
they need to see that we have unfeigned faith.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.880
We're being watched.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.600
We've often said over the years that a mother's job is really

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.880
never over.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.280
And some of you that have young children say amen and amen.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.200
Some of you that have older children say amen and amen.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
But the reality is the mother's job is never over.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.700
You know, there's never a time really

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.720
when we're not being observed, not

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.920
being watched.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.880
You remember the account of Moses

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.880
when he first was going to leave the palace

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.080
and he saw that Egyptian doing something wrong?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.080
And the Bible tells us this.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.480
He looked this way and he looked that way

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160
and he thought no one was looking around

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.320
and then he took matters in his own hands.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.440
You remember the text?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.400
Sometimes we think no one's watching.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.080
But what happened when Moses then

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.680
went to the two brethren that were arguing and disputing

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.280
and he tries to provide mediation between them?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.440
What does he do?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.520
They say, oh, are you going to kill us

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.020
like you killed that guy yesterday?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.920
We're always being observed.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.520
We're always being watched.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.600
The reality is that as we're being watched,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.720
as our lives are being observed, I

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.760
trust that our faith would be described

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.600
as being unfeigned faith, the real deal, the real thing.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.160
It's not just a talk.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.040
Someone said this, talk is cheap.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.680
A certain way it is, isn't it?

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.080
Our walk, that people see our faith,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.840
it is described to us in this text of Scripture

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.840
as being unfeigned faith.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.720
First, in thy grandmother Lois, but also in your mother Eunice

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.680
and in thee also Timothy, this generational faith.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.000
What a blessing.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.120
Not only do we see how this faith is described,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.400
but I want you to consider with me how the faith is delivered.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.840
How the faith is delivered.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040
No doubt, as we would think about the description

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.120
of the faith of these, the mom and grandmother of Timothy,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.840
no doubt their faith was lived out daily.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.760
The reality is that the just shall live by faith.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.480
That's what the word of God tells us.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.280
And we think about living by faith

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.160
and we think about the truth of our faith.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.040
We can say that we have faith,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.840
but how does somebody see our faith?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.600
It's through our actions, it's through our behavior,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.560
it's through living out our faith.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.480
And we take those steps of faith

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.240
and we live out daily our faith.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.120
And in addition to not only living out our faith

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.860
and being an example to those who are watching us,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.600
I believe that there's some very purpose things

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360
that we can do in order to ensure

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.960
that the faith is delivered, that it's delivered.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.000
You're familiar with the text of scripture,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.840
you don't need to turn there,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.800
but in the single chapter book of Jude in verse number three,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.400
Jude says this, he says,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.160
"'Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.000
"'of the common salvation,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.780
"'it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.400
"'that you should earnestly contend for the faith.'"

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.320
And then he says this,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.640
"'which was once delivered unto the saints.'"

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.920
And so we think about this faith

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.960
and we understand how the faith was described

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.480
as being unfeigned faith,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.120
but when we think about this generational faith

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.400
and we consider the grandmother and the mother

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.920
and now Timothy as the one being spoken to,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.640
I say this morning, the faith is delivered.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.620
It's not only described to us and defined to us

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.920
as being unfeigned faith, but it's delivered.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.200
And how is it that I can deliver this faith

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.840
to a future generation?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.900
How is it that I can deliver my faith to my children?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.880
Just a few simple thoughts this morning.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.080
Number one, I would say this, we need to be intentional.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.800
Be intentional.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.600
In other words, could I say it this way, develop a plan.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.960
Someone said this, if you have no plan,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.320
then you plan to fail.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.720
There's some truth to that.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.040
And as we consider the importance, I believe this morning,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.560
that as we desire to be intentional,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.480
that as we develop a plan,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.920
then as we seek to stick to that plan,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.440
that we could see how that we can deliver a faith,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.280
our faith, an unfeigned faith to a future generation.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.600
I think of this when we're talking about being intentional

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.320
and developing a plan.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.040
We live in a time in which busyness

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.600
is something that describes many of our schedules.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.520
Is it not?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.880
Busyness is an obstacle for every one of us.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.880
But can I tell you this morning that busyness

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.080
is an obstacle that must be overcome.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.560
Busyness cannot prevent us from investing

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.060
in what is most important in the lives

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.600
of those that are observing us.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.680
Sometimes we just get too so busy in life.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.840
And that busyness is an obstacle.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.760
Listen, I believe with all my heart

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.660
that the enemy wants to make us busy.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.680
He wants to keep us busy,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.400
distract it with all sorts of maybe even good things

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.360
and keeping us from the best thing.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.440
I understand that we have many responsibilities

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.520
and we have many things that have to be fulfilled

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.920
in our lives, but the reality is that God has entrusted

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.600
to us a responsibility to a future generation.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.200
If you have children this morning,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.920
if God has blessed you with children,

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.920
you have a very important role and responsibility

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.960
on delivering an unfeigned faith to your children.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.240
I want you to think about this as I've spoken

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.540
about being intentional and developing a plan.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.560
Turn over to 2 Timothy 3 if you will.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.040
And I want you to notice the truth of verse number 15.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.280
In light of what we've seen in verse number five

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.120
of chapter number one, when Paul says to Timothy,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.040
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.480
that is in thee, but he says this,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.600
which first, it dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.240
and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.920
And we come to the third chapter

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.800
and we read in verse number 15,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.800
that the Bible says, and that from a child

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.480
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.560
That from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.520
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.940
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.640
I think about the truth of this verse of Scripture,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.400
the importance of the children learning the word of God

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.960
and the home and what a great responsibility

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.960
that is ours to diligently teach our children

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.140
to be intentional, to develop a plan,

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.340
to desire to deliver our faith to our descendants,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.080
to those that are observing us.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.120
And we think about the truth of this passage of Scripture,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.240
the Bible says that from a child thou has known

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.860
the Holy Scriptures, but I want you to understand

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.900
this morning that knowing the Holy Scriptures

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.340
isn't just about having some body of knowledge,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.820
it's not just about being able to rehearse

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.580
some number of facts and being able to say,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.540
here are the tribes of Israel

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.420
and here are the kings of Israel

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.740
and here are the kings of Judah

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.260
and here are the books of the Bible

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.020
and here's the, and it's just a bunch of knowledge.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.900
No, the truth of the Scripture in the very next verse,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.340
it says that God's word, all Scripture is given

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.180
by inspiration of God and it says this, and is profitable.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.140
And I want you to notice that in verse number 15,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.840
the greatest, the most significant profit that we have

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.340
as we look to the word of God is that it says this,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.340
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.020
Wow, I am so thankful that this Bible

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.860
that we hold in our hands contains within the pages thereof

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.420
the truth of the Gospel.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.740
William Scroggie described the Bible this way,

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.220
it is the unfolding drama of redemption.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.220
And I love that description of the Bible.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.860
And as you look at the truth of redemption

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.820
throughout the Scriptures and you understand

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.059
the plan of redemption as it's set forth

00:18:58.059 --> 00:18:59.780
in Ephesians chapter number one,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.100
that before the very foundation of the world,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.780
God Almighty knew that man was going to sin.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.940
He knew that sin was going to enter

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.600
through the trespass of Adam and Eve in Genesis three.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.460
He knew that and he developed a plan.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.900
Genesis, or Ephesians chapter number one

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.020
is not describing for us or discussing to us

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.780
the who of salvation.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.300
Ephesians chapter number one is revealing to us

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.940
the how of salvation that God determined

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.100
before the foundation of the world

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.580
that the only way for mankind to be saved,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.500
to be redeemed is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.059
His death, burial and glorious resurrection

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.700
on the, that is the Gospel.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.580
And as we understand his substitutionary atonement,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.660
his glorious resurrection, we can rest in having

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.179
the knowledge that through the Scriptures,

00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:56.140
they are able to make us wise unto salvation

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.780
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.580
what glorious message the Bible contains.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.980
Paul said this, he said, it's a truth,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.680
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.660
that Christ Jesus came into the world,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.780
for what purpose?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.180
To save sinners.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.540
And then he says, of whom I am chief.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.860
This morning, there is a universal condition amongst mankind

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.060
and that universal condition is one of sin.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.060
The Bible tells us that all have sinned

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.780
and come short of the glory of God.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.540
There's not one person other than the Lord Jesus Christ

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.380
that's ever walked upon this face of the earth

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.380
that's been without sin.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.980
And with that universal condition that mankind has sinned,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.740
they have offended a holy God,

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.740
they have broken his law and the consequence is death.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.340
But as we sang this morning about our Savior's love,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.100
oh, how marvelous, amen?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.100
It's amazing love that God so loved the world

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.540
that he gave his only begotten Son.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.380
Why?

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.220
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.700
but have everlasting life.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.660
Jesus Christ himself said, I am the way,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.060
the truth and the life.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.940
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.820
Peter would stand with great boldness

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.060
as he was questioned by the religious leaders

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.260
in Acts chapter number four

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.900
and they were questioning about the miracle

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.420
of Acts chapter number three

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.540
and they were saying that it was perhaps in his own power.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.180
And he said, listen, let it be known

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.120
that this is not in my power,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.780
that this man has been made whole.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.980
It's through the power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.920
And then he says this,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.260
neither is there salvation in any other.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.020
There's no other name under heaven given among men

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.220
whereby we must be saved.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.300
This morning, when we think about delivering

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.500
this faith that we're speaking of this morning,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.180
this generational faith,

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.820
can I tell you this morning the greatest impact

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.820
that we could have on this next generation,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.240
on those that are observing us,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.540
is that they would understand

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.380
that the gospel of Jesus Christ through the word of God.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.780
We have God's word, we have the authority.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.580
And mankind needs to be redeemed.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.420
And here Paul says that from a child

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.380
thou hast known the holy scriptures

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.660
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.540
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.220
That phrase when he says through faith,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.440
many today have this misunderstanding.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.820
Some very sincere,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.140
believing that they can do good things to get to heaven.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.060
And if I could just be good enough,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.940
if I could just do enough good things,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.260
if at the end of it all, if there's a giant scale

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.500
and there's more on this side than on that side,

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.740
then I'll be okay.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.500
That's just not what the Bible teaches.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.660
It's through faith.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.260
In fact, in Ephesians 2, in verses eight and nine,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.340
he says, for by grace are you saved through faith.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.660
And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.980
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.620
By the way, I've often thought

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:26.380
how difficult of a life it would be to live daily,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.820
wondering from moment to moment

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.700
if I've done enough good to get to heaven.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.420
And at some level, I become the standard

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.260
or the authority for determining

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.820
whether I've done enough good.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.620
And then if I do something really bad,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.380
how many good things does it cancel out?

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.460
It's a really challenging way to live.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.740
And I'm thankful that God says,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.060
it's not of works, it's a gift.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.540
And I paid for this gift

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.900
with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.380
Man, what a gift.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.740
And Paul says to Timothy, that's what you learn.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.700
You learn the scriptures and the scriptures

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.180
are able to make you wise unto salvation.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.380
We pray for the children in our church

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.020
that they'd be saved.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.220
I pray for the children in our church

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.020
that they'd be saved at a young age

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.700
so that they would have a life of service to the master.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.540
D.L. Moody was asked one day after a meeting

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.100
if anyone trusted Christ as their savior

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.820
on that particular day in that meeting.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.220
And he said, two and a half.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.020
And they said, oh, two adults and one child.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.540
He said, no, two children and one adult.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.540
He said, because the children have their whole life

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.260
to live for Jesus.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.300
I like that perspective.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.780
Here this morning, we have some children in our church

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.620
that have been saved.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.460
We have some children in our church

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.900
that haven't been saved

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.260
and we need to pray for their salvation.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.140
And we know that as we teach them the word of God,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.780
listen, it's not so they can just stand up

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.860
and tell us about Noah and Moses

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.620
and tell us about Jonah and David and Goliath

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.580
and all of these stories.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.740
No, the scriptures, the word of God is given to us,

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.180
yes, to provide us with historical account

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.020
and so on and so forth,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.700
but the most important profit that we have

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.860
in the word of God is that it's through the pages

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.540
of this book that we learn the truth of salvation.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.900
And what a joy, what a joy.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.220
I said, number one, be intentional.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.580
Number two, could I say this?

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.580
How am I going to deliver my faith to a future generation,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.900
not only to be intentional to develop a plan,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.820
but I would say this, be consistent.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.420
You know, consistency is a challenge.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.180
It really is, because there are some days

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.340
that we just feel like it'd be nice if I could have off.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.220
You ever feel that way?

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.220
Man, it'd just be nice to be off today.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.220
Consistency, it's key.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.220
You know, I've learned in my own life,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.780
Holly and I have learned as parents,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.400
the key of consistency.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.540
I can't tell you that I've mastered it,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.440
but I've learned the importance of it.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.340
It's not just something that I've learned through experience

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.180
but it's something that we learn through the scriptures.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.260
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.260
And I want you to see what is said is God

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.500
is preparing his people to enter into the land of promise

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.860
and he's giving, in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.860
these pieces of instruction in order for his people

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.440
to be prepared, he's using Moses.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.580
Of course, Moses would not be permitted

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.260
to lead the children of Israel into the land of promise.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.260
It would be Joshua who would have that responsibility.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.820
But it's Moses that is used here in the book of Deuteronomy

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.920
to provide the nation with all of the instruction

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.300
and really rehearsing the law

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.980
and all that is necessary for the people to hear

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.820
and to know.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.020
And I want you to see what he says in Deuteronomy 6

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.940
in verse number six.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.340
Notice he says this,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.460
and these words which I command thee this day

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.160
shall be in thine heart.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.780
And thou shalt teach them,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.020
notice that next word, diligently, unto thy children

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.520
and shalt talk of them when,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.940
when thou sittest in thine house,

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.300
when thou walkest by the way,

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.620
when thou liest down and when thou risest up.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.740
Not only should you share these things,

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.980
teach these things to your children when you're sitting

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.420
and when you're walking and when you lie down

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.260
and when you rise up,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.660
but then he says this in verse eight,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.700
thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.940
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.580
and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100
and upon thy gates.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.120
I like scripture versus being in the house.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.660
I like scripture versus being visible, why?

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.700
Because we're reminded of the importance of scripture,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.820
the words of God, the importance of teaching our children.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.380
And the reality is that there may be some time

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.540
that in our developing our plan and being intentional

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.860
that we have sit down instruction,

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.780
but then as we live our lives,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.980
that we are living out the scriptures.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.220
In this text of scripture in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.100
it's very interesting because the reality

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.700
is that the responsibility to teach them diligently

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.780
is given in verse number seven as we've read already,

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.180
but the reality is that the responsibility first

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.900
was to them to personally obey

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.220
and do what the scriptures taught.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.260
And after you have obeyed and you've implemented

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.460
the truth of God's word in your own life,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.300
then you teach it diligently unto thy child,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.220
unto thy children.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.980
Not only teaching an instructional form,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.800
going through some devotional book or whatever it may be,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.000
but also teaching through our lives.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.340
As we're observed,

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.500
people should see us living out biblical truth, amen?

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.180
They should see in our lives

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.480
that we're living out our faith.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.700
That it's not compartmentalized,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.700
it's not some kind of secular and sacred

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.900
that we've made these compartments in our lives.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.300
No, I belong to Jesus and I am His and He is mine

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.540
and this is my faith and I'm going to live my faith.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.300
What a joy, what a blessing and we're to be consistent.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.420
Let me say this as we would consider

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.100
how the faith is delivered.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.180
Let me say this, guard against evil influences.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.820
We need to be willing to fight for the next generation.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.800
Seriously.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.940
We need to guard against the evil influences.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.340
You need to have a desire to fight for your kids,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.460
to fight for those within our church.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.460
You say, I don't have any children at home.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.900
Yeah, but there's some kids in our church that are watching you, and they need to see

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.740
in you that your faith is real.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.740
They need to see in Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so that they have faith, they believe God.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.460
It's real to them.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.620
We guard against these evil influences.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:23.300
You understand that the world is coming after your kids.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.700
The world is coming after the next generation.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.300
And I tell you, with each passing day, it's becoming clearer and clearer that that is

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.340
their plan.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:40.600
What has been for a period of time, generations in fact, disguised and covered up, is really

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.580
just being put straight in our face as to what the plan is for them to take the next

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.660
generation.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.060
We need to understand that the next generation is worth fighting for.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.460
Do you believe that this morning?

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.740
The next generation is worth fighting for.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.500
The generational faith, we understand the faith that was once delivered, but here's

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:11.380
what Jude said, that you would earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.300
the saints.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.860
And we know as we study church history, as we study the history of how the gospel got

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.380
to us, that there were some people that have gone before us that understood the next generation

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.140
was worth fighting for.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:38.280
There are many that we can study through church history that laid down their lives so that

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.080
we might have the truth of the gospel.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:47.220
They sacrificed greatly so that a future generation would have a Bible.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.180
We have this responsibility to guard against evil influences.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.100
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:02.500
In 1 Corinthians chapter number 15, 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, I actually preached

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.480
a message just from this verse of Scripture a few months ago when we did on a Wednesday

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.340
night series, Be Not Deceived.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.220
I did that for several weeks, a series.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.740
And I actually titled the message, if you'd want to listen to it, I believe it's on our

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.740
website.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:26.220
I titled the message from 1 Corinthians 15, 33, Spiritual Distancing.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.220
We heard so many times in the last two years this thing of social distancing, right?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.460
I need to social distance from you because I don't want to get this virus, right?

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.060
We heard that over and over and over.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:46.780
And as I heard that so many times, the Lord impressed upon my heart the reality as Bible-believing

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.820
disciples of Jesus Christ that we need to have spiritual distancing.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.740
He said, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.740
Amen?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.980
He says, as you study the Old Testament, that there's to be a difference.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.740
We see in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, notice what Paul says under the inspiration

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.980
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.940
He says, be not deceived.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:16.140
Now, if a verse of Scripture starts with those words, we ought to pay close attention, don't

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.620
you agree?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.140
Because the reality is the verse of Scripture starts with those words.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:28.140
It's like, okay, so this could be something I could easily be deceived by, right?

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.060
Remember in Galatians 6, be not deceived.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.060
God is not mocked.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.420
What sort of man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.820
How many people have lived their lives thinking, being deceived by that thought that I can

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:46.540
sow all sorts of wild, ungodly seed, and I'm not going to reap that kind of a harvest?

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.540
Countless people.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:54.020
A theologian of yesteryear, in fact, a preacher of yesteryear, a couple of hundred years ago,

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.020
actually.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:00.300
He's preaching to the people then, and he says, you guys are out sowing bad seed six

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:05.540
days a week, and you come to church on Sunday and pray for crop failure.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.660
That was 200 years ago that he said that.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.500
What about today?

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.340
But God said, be not deceived.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.460
Here we read those words, be not deceived.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.260
Man, my antenna goes up.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.860
We always should have that approach as we go to the Word of God that I ought to be fully

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.300
engaged and I ought to be ready to receive something from the Word of God.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.860
But when he says, be not deceived, it's kind of like that beware sign, right?

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.860
That caution.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:35.460
We spoke on Thursday night in our men's meeting about warnings and learning to appreciate

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.460
warnings.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.060
Listen, when I go out door knocking and I see a sign that says, beware of dog, I'm taking

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:47.220
note, man, because I don't want to be bit, and I don't want to hurt their dog.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.300
You understand what I'm saying?

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.260
And so when I see a sign that says, beware of dog, I'm very cautious.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.140
And we see here that he says, be not deceived.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:11.180
Look what he says, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:18.900
I can go there, I can do this, I can watch that, I can read this, I can listen to that,

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.300
and it's not going to affect me.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.140
Be not deceived.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:31.100
I think about delivering our faith to a future generation.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.820
We need to guard against the evil influences.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:40.480
I think about the evil influences of TV.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:51.140
You know that in some of the shows that they're playing for these young kids today, I'm talking

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:56.420
about toddler-age kids.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:03.580
They're sending messages through those movies, through those videos, through those series.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:13.020
You'd be surprised as to how they're undermining what you're trying to teach your children.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:18.180
They're being exposed to these evil influences, and they're beginning to walk away thinking

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.780
these things are normal, that these things are acceptable, that these things are appropriate.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.620
And then all of a sudden, because they've been watching these series of cartoons and

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:30.300
these shows, and they're being exposed to all of this thing, and then we try to teach

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.300
them the Bible, and they're like, what are you talking about?

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.300
TV, we need to be careful.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:53.060
School, friends, music, magazines, books, and we can just go on and on and on, and think

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.180
about those evil influences.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:01.420
Listen, we understand this evening that we have an enemy, we have an enemy, and our enemy

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:06.540
wants to devour to destroy us, but we understand this morning that the enemy wants to devour

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.180
and destroy a future generation.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.660
He wants to destroy your kids.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:19.340
I don't think there's one amongst us that if someone came to you and said, there's this

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.580
person, here's who they are, and they describe, they identify the individual, and they say

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:32.820
to you that that individual wants to destroy the people that are closest to you physically,

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.100
that there are some things you would do.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.540
There's some action you would take.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.700
There's some preparation that you would go through, right?

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:46.220
Because you know of a real threat, and you say, no, no, that's my spouse, that's my child,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.320
that's my parent, that's my...

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.660
The enemy wants to destroy you, and he wants to destroy your kids.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.620
The generation in our church, you say, I don't have any kids at home anymore, pastor.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.900
We got kids in our church, they just sang right here.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:06.220
We got kids down in the nursery right now this morning, kids that are sitting here.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:11.380
Not only does Satan want to destroy me, but he wants to destroy these kids.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:17.580
And we need to guard against those evil influences, and we need to be careful to understand that

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.660
the Word of God says, be not deceived.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:27.540
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.860
I remember Palmer Sean said this several years ago, we had a family conference, and he said

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.500
that when he was raising their only daughter, Jennifer, I believe is her name, that he was

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:48.140
criticized because he wanted to take part in picking her friends, and he was criticized

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.140
for that.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.020
And he said, listen, I have a responsibility.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.179
I have a responsibility, and I'm going to know who my daughter's friends are.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:03.740
And I'm going to be involved and engaged, and I'm going to be, I'm going to be present.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.540
I'm going to know what's going on.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:13.820
This morning, as we look at this generational faith, Paul is writing to Timothy, and he

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:20.420
says, Timothy, when I call to remembrance the faith that is in thee, but he says it's

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.460
not just the faith, it's the unfeigned faith.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.900
He describes it as being a faith that is without pretense.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.100
There's no hypocrisy.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.580
There's no dissimulation.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.660
It's not counterfeit.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.660
It is genuine.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.380
It is the real deal.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:42.059
He says, this faith that I recall, that I see in you, but it was first in your grandmother

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:43.500
and it was in your mother.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.500
He said, man, I'm rejoicing in this because it's unfeigned faith.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.540
Oh, that our faith would be described as being real.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:40:00.059
Then as we consider the description, we must consider how is that faith delivered?

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:00.500
How do we...

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:06.360
How do we get it to the next generation?

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.939
There is a responsibility on the part of the next generation to take the baton.

00:40:10.939 --> 00:40:14.619
I cannot pretend this morning that that's not true.

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:19.659
They have to be willing to receive it, but, oh, that it would never be said that we didn't

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:28.180
deliver it, amen, that we would do everything in our power, simple thoughts, be intentional,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:37.020
develop a plan, don't allow busyness to be an obstacle that prevents us, rather an obstacle

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:47.819
that must be overcome, be consistent, be consistent, and then guard against evil influences.

00:40:47.819 --> 00:40:53.220
If we do those things, I believe it will go a long way to helping us deliver that unfamed

00:40:53.220 --> 00:41:00.939
faith to a future generation, because what we need is we need generational faith, amen?

00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:01.939
Let's pray together.

00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:03.580
Father, we love You.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.779
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:05.779 --> 00:41:11.819
We thank You for the testimony of Timothy, and so often we read the Scriptures and we

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:16.540
read about Timothy and the ministries in which he's involved in and the work in which he's

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:23.459
engaged in, and we can rejoice in how You used him as a faithful servant of the Lord.

00:41:23.459 --> 00:41:37.940
But as we come to this passage of Scripture, we're reminded about a mom and a grandmom,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.660
this generational faith, this unfamed faith.

00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:46.980
God, I pray that our faith would be described that way.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:52.620
We're thankful that as it was delivered, that from a child, Timothy knew the Scriptures

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.260
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:01.580
Perhaps this morning, Lord, there's someone that's never trusted Christ as their Savior.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:11.119
They're trying everything they can do to get to heaven on their own.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:17.399
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would take the truth of the Word of God and convince

00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:25.399
the one that might be lost here this morning of their need for salvation, that it's not

00:42:25.399 --> 00:42:31.759
by works of righteousness which we have done, but it's according to His mercy He hath begotten

00:42:31.759 --> 00:42:38.440
us, that we're saved by faith, by grace through faith.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.919
It's not of works.

00:42:39.919 --> 00:42:45.559
Oh, God, if there's someone here this morning not saved, would You help them to desire to

00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:48.000
have that settled?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.440
They would know for sure that heaven is their home.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:58.320
For every child of God, whether we have children at home or not, I pray that You'd help us

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:06.360
to understand this morning the importance of influence, having an impact, having generational

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.119
faith.

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:16.240
Our children, our children's children, the children in our church, that if You do not

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:22.399
come in the next generation, that there'd be a church that would still stand on this

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:30.440
very place preaching the same very Word of God, we'd see generational faith.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.839
Would You move and work in hearts and lives as only You can?

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:38.360
We'll give You the glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.960
Would you stand with me?

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.800
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around this morning.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.320
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you could know

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.559
for sure that heaven is your home.

00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:53.279
Perhaps this morning you want to come to this altar and pray for your kids.

00:43:53.279 --> 00:43:56.039
Maybe this morning we need some people to come to this altar and pray for the kids in

00:43:56.039 --> 00:44:03.399
our church, that we deliver unfeigned faith to a future generation.

00:44:03.399 --> 00:44:05.919
As Miss Jackie plays on the piano, the altar is open.
