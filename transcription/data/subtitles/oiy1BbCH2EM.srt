1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Well, again, it's an honor to be here and thank you for being here.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,239
And I pray that together we can learn a lot this week and that I can be a blessing.

3
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,120
You've already been a blessing to me.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,780
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,360
Take your Bible, if you would, and turn to 2 Corinthians 10.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,440
While you're turning there, I have to make this comment.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,920
I don't know how many years I've known Joe.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Joe left.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,479
I guess, oh, he's back there, okay.

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:44,819
But honestly, he was probably six or seven years old when we first met, and he was about

11
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:47,680
to my knee.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,680
And now, many years later, I don't make it to his knee anymore.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,560
And I only see him every couple of years now, and I just stand amazed at how the Lord

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,439
is prospering him in his height.

15
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,479
Now, the Lord is working with me in a similar way.

16
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,080
It's just this direction.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,000
So I love Joe.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Amen.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,639
Take your Bible, 2 Corinthians 10.

20
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:21,220
Let's notice in verse 14, Paul speaking, for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure

21
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,540
as though we reached not unto you.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,099
For we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ, not boasting of things

23
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:39,860
without our measure, that is, of other men's labors, but having hope when your faith is

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:48,040
increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, to preach

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,319
the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things

26
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:03,199
made ready to our hand, but he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

27
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,199
Let's pray.

28
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:09,000
Father, we're grateful for this time you've given us to be together.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
We're thankful, Lord, for this church and for the testimony of this church, their love

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,240
for missions, their concern for the world and for the need of lost souls to know Christ.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,679
Lord, it is a valid question to ask ourselves, do we care?

32
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,800
Do I care?

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,639
Thank you for that message and song.

34
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,880
And we ask you now, Holy Spirit, this is your word, we are your people, and I pray that

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,759
you would do what no preacher can do.

36
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,720
Would you speak to the heart of every individual, expose to them their need and expose what

37
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,520
your word wants us to understand, convict us and help us, I pray.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,880
In Jesus' name, amen.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,559
I'll make an obvious statement, the world is immense, isn't it?

40
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:04,759
Sometimes I just ponder how big, not only geographically, the world is, although that's

41
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:12,279
astounding, and to me amazing that with modern travel we can cover thousands and thousands

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,839
of miles in hours instead of weeks and months, as it once was.

43
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:24,000
But I'm also always amazed at the size of the world and the sheer population.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I am told, and I don't know, but some people say there are as many as 8 billion people

45
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,919
on planet earth.

46
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,279
To be honest with you, I get lost after a hundred, so I don't know what 8 billion is,

47
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:44,639
but I know that it's an incomprehensible number by one individual.

48
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:51,639
I think of how large it is in diversity, how many languages are on planet earth, how many

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,039
people groups are on planet earth.

50
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,119
And then to understand that probably a third of them have not only never heard a clear

51
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:06,039
presentation of the gospel, some of them have never even heard the name of Jesus.

52
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:13,039
And when I think of how large it is, then I'm amazed by this thought, that as large

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,720
and as diverse as all the peoples and cultures and languages are, there is one name by which

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,480
every one of those souls must come to for salvation, and that is through Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,600
There aren't many ways.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,040
There aren't many names.

57
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,160
Languages don't change the need of a soul.

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,480
Language doesn't alter the need of a soul.

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,640
Culture doesn't change what every soul needs.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Every soul needs the Lord Jesus Christ.

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,920
When I think about how immense the world is and how great God's love for every individual

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,119
is, then I come to this thought as well.

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,079
I'm somewhat embarrassed about how small my world is.

64
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,559
Many days and too many ways and too many days I live my life concerned only about the three

65
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,519
foot circle that is around me.

66
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,760
What impacts me?

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,839
What is in my day that day?

68
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,839
What's my need without ever giving a real thought to what the need of this world is?

69
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,679
I'm challenged when I read about men like the Apostle Paul and passages like we're looking

70
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:40,679
at this morning, to be a man like Paul who lived beyond his world.

71
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,019
That's my message this morning, living beyond our world.

72
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:52,959
Two times in the verses we read, Paul uses that word under the inspiration of the Spirit,

73
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,519
but he said he wants to go beyond his measure.

74
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,519
He wants to preach in the regions beyond where he is.

75
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,959
I think he alludes to the fact that he lives beyond his means, and I'll be very careful

76
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,720
to explain that in just a few moments.

77
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,359
But I think in every one of our lives, every one of our hearts as believers, there ought

78
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:22,359
to be a sense, a burden to live beyond who and where we are.

79
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:29,279
I don't mean to be negative in my preaching, but folks, we find ourselves living, I believe,

80
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,839
in the most narcissistic generation that has ever populated planet earth.

81
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,440
It is all about me.

82
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,880
It is, we don't live the we life, we live the me life.

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,880
And even believers have to purposely, intentionally break out of that and say, Lord, help me to

84
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,519
see beyond me.

85
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,079
And like the Apostle Paul, be willing to live beyond our measure.

86
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:04,079
Be willing to live beyond reaching, beyond our border, even living beyond our means.

87
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,320
And if those things I want to talk about for a few moments this morning, I want you to

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,359
think about what Paul means when he says he lived beyond his measure.

89
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:22,359
Look again at verse 14, for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we

90
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
reach not unto you.

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,959
Understand this, that there were times, often, when the Apostle Paul and the church at Corinth

92
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,720
had kind of an adversarial relationship.

93
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,200
The people at Corinth did not like Paul's authority, I suppose they didn't like anyone's

94
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:48,200
authority over them, and sometimes they chafed at what Paul demanded of them or said to them

95
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,320
or preached to them.

96
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,959
And at this moment, what they're feeling, what they're saying is, Paul, you're challenging

97
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,600
us to reach a world.

98
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,720
You're challenging us to take the gospel to every creature.

99
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,119
But Paul, don't you understand we have our own problems?

100
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,959
Don't you understand, Paul, here at Corinth, we've got issues here.

101
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,799
In our lives, we have issues here.

102
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:19,160
You just keep telling us to reach beyond and reach beyond, and Paul, you're a dreamer.

103
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,920
You're dreaming if you think the gospel can go to every place in the globe and everybody

104
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,040
ought to hear.

105
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,239
And I love what Paul's answer is to them.

106
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:34,960
In essence, he says, we reached you.

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,440
We reached you.

108
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,840
You see, there's always been people who would doubt whether the gospel could ever go from

109
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,880
Jerusalem to Samaria.

110
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,359
I mean, the gospel is meant for Jerusalem.

111
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,359
But you know what?

112
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:55,960
God intended it to go beyond Jerusalem, and he had to send some persecution to get it

113
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
done.

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,799
But they did take the gospel to Samaria, and you know what?

115
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,960
Samaritans did get saved.

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,239
And not only did it go to Samaria, well, maybe it could go to Samaria, because they've

117
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:15,640
got some linkage to the Jewish, the Hebrew culture, but it could never go to Gentiles.

118
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,799
But it did go to Gentiles.

119
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,880
It went to Antioch, and the people at Antioch had a great revival there and saved.

120
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,799
A great church was established at Antioch among Gentiles, and by the way, it became

121
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,119
the model church for modern missions there in Antioch.

122
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:39,039
And by the way, that's where they were first called Christians.

123
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,119
I'm just saying there's always been people who said it couldn't be done.

124
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:50,679
There's always people who said it could never jump an ocean, but the gospel did jump an

125
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,679
ocean.

126
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:58,039
It jumped the Aegean, and Paul took the gospel to Philippi, and Thessalonica, Berea, Corinth,

127
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,919
and oh, by the way, we sit

128
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,399
in this room this morning because the gospel jumped

129
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,959
another ocean.

130
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,639
It jumped the Atlantic Ocean.

131
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,819
And we are the recipients of the truth of the Word of God

132
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,239
because there is no barrier or border that

133
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,639
can stop the Word of God.

134
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,759
And you and I ought to live with that thought that, yeah,

135
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,199
God can do more than I understand.

136
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:27,519
God can do more than I can anticipate.

137
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,519
God can do something.

138
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,239
Listen, if you are concerned just

139
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:35,639
about the measure of what can be done in the life

140
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,959
or through the life of Mike Edwards,

141
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,319
I assure you not much.

142
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,919
But if you pour the Spirit of God and the will of God

143
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,919
into a surrendered Mike Edwards, much can be done.

144
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,139
Fellowship Baptist Church is a spot

145
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,479
on a map in Fairfax County, Virginia.

146
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:58,359
But pour the Holy Spirit in Fellowship Baptist Church,

147
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:01,319
and you'd be amazed at the measure of what

148
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,439
God could do in reaching an entire world.

149
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,839
Because it is not our measure that is the difference.

150
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,559
It is God's measure working through us.

151
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,959
Now unto him that is able to exceeding abundantly

152
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,039
above all that we ask or think, according

153
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,759
to the power that worketh in us.

154
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,959
God is able to do exceeding abundantly great things

155
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,679
through us in this place if we will see and trust and believe

156
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,719
that God can work in us.

157
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,759
The Apostle Paul was a man who lived beyond his own measure,

158
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,599
his own ability.

159
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,679
He was a man that was willing to live beyond his own borders.

160
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,279
I love what he says in verse 16.

161
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,879
He wanted to preach the gospel in the regions

162
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,399
beyond you.

163
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,159
One of the greatest political questions

164
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,719
we face in our nation today is who and how

165
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,959
do we allow people to come into our country,

166
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,439
both legally and illegally?

167
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,959
To be honest with you, that's a question for other minds

168
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,399
than mine.

169
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,639
The great question that our church ought to be pondering

170
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,479
is not who comes in.

171
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:20,439
It ought to be how do we get our folks to go out?

172
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,959
How do we get people to see the great need

173
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,759
of reaching this lost world?

174
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,359
Paul was a man who was interested in going beyond,

175
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,359
in reaching beyond his border, if you will.

176
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:37,159
He was saved around 42 AD.

177
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,919
That's a long time ago.

178
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,319
He spent some silent years in the desert

179
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,999
being taught of others and being taught of the Lord

180
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,239
specifically.

181
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:51,919
Around 46 AD, he began preaching, traveling the world,

182
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,479
preaching the gospel.

183
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:57,559
And for the next 15 years, he traveled by foot.

184
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,439
He traveled by ship.

185
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,439
He was supported by others, but also when needed,

186
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,319
worked as a tent maker.

187
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,679
He preached in cities.

188
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,479
He preached in villages.

189
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:11,199
He preached both in season and out of season.

190
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,679
He preached in Jerusalem.

191
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,999
He preached in North Africa.

192
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,799
He preached in Asia Minor.

193
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,239
He preached in Greece, the islands

194
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,039
of the Mediterranean, Italy, and even

195
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,679
in the capital of the Roman Empire itself,

196
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,079
he preached the gospel in Rome.

197
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,319
And I believe if he would have had

198
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:33,719
modern means of transportation, Paul literally

199
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:38,679
would have reached his entire known world.

200
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,919
He preached to Jews, but he also preached to pagans.

201
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,359
He preached to paupers and kings,

202
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,679
to anyone that would listen, to include those who

203
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,479
kept him in chains in prison.

204
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,319
There was no border.

205
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,479
There was no barrier that could keep him out

206
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,639
if it was the Lord's will that he go.

207
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,079
He literally lived the Great Commission.

208
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,479
When we read Regents Beyond You, sometimes we

209
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,839
think, well, that's an interesting phrase,

210
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,759
but we forget the life that Paul led to accomplish that.

211
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,599
And I don't know about you, but what that creates in my heart

212
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:26,239
is not necessarily a guilt. It creates in me

213
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:30,079
a question of, what do I do?

214
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,479
What's my commitment to reach a lost world in the way

215
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,839
that Paul reached it?

216
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,679
As I was studying for this message,

217
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,239
I noticed that phrase, Regents Beyond.

218
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,399
And in one of the commentators I read,

219
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,759
he said there's no way to really quantify Regents Beyond,

220
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
because it depends on where you are.

221
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,959
But he said the best way to understand Regents Beyond

222
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,119
is this, still further, still further.

223
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,799
And I was so struck by that.

224
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,319
Can I tell you one of the fears of my life?

225
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,599
Here's one of the fears in the heart of Mike Edwards.

226
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:14,159
I've been saved since 1975.

227
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,439
I've been in ministry soon after.

228
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,199
I have studied my Bible.

229
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,719
I have preached.

230
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,119
I have been part of programs.

231
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,359
I've won souls.

232
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,279
I've prayed.

233
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,559
You say, are you boasting?

234
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,319
No, I'm just telling you.

235
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,199
I've been at it for a while.

236
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,919
And can I tell you one of the fears

237
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,119
and one of the dangers in my life?

238
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:42,319
To come to the place where I think I've done enough.

239
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,199
To think that I've learned enough.

240
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,239
To think that I've studied enough.

241
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,759
To think that I've given of myself enough.

242
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,879
To think that I've given enough.

243
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,439
To think that there's nothing else for me.

244
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,119
To think that someone else should share the burden.

245
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:59,079
To think that someone else should do the work.

246
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,639
Hey, I hope that God gives me the grace

247
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,279
for every day of my life to say there is still further I can go.

248
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,479
There is still more that I can do.

249
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:15,599
There is still someone I can reach.

250
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,719
There is still more of my heart to surrender to the Lord.

251
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:24,039
And may God help all of us to guard our hearts

252
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,559
against being content with what we have done.

253
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,599
There is still more that I can give.

254
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:37,719
There is still more that I can sacrifice.

255
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:44,559
There is still more that I need to grow in in my life still further.

256
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,759
One of my heroes of the faith is a man named C.T. Studd.

257
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,439
What a name.

258
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,679
And C.T. Studd, it won't mean much to us,

259
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,999
but in the early 1900s, C.T. Studd was a great cricket player.

260
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,039
I mean, it was a very big deal.

261
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,159
He was a professional cricket player.

262
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,919
He made a big mistake.

263
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,879
One night he was invited to a moody rally, and he went.

264
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,759
And he got saved.

265
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,959
And when he got saved, all of a sudden cricket

266
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,719
wasn't as important to him.

267
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:21,159
And long story short, he became a great missionary,

268
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:24,919
giving up that career and all the notoriety that went with it

269
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,999
and served in many places across the globe.

270
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,959
But he knew how to turn a phrase.

271
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,199
And let me just give you two of them.

272
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:36,759
He said once, some want to live within the sound of a church

273
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,679
or a chapel bell.

274
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,559
I want to run a rescue shop within a yard of hell.

275
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,479
Now, that's a phrase, and that's a preacher,

276
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,519
and we do stuff like that.

277
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,519
But I love that sentiment, that I'm not

278
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,399
content to just be in the comfortable place.

279
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:59,039
I'm not content to just take the easy way, that I want to go

280
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,079
and I want to be used of the Lord.

281
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,319
And if it takes me into the uncomfortable place,

282
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,959
into the inconvenient place, then Lord, so be it.

283
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:11,719
There is still further I can go.

284
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:19,119
He said this, if Jesus Christ is God and died for me,

285
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:25,399
then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for him.

286
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,839
What a heart.

287
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,399
How do you get there?

288
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,839
How do we care about a lost world, a lost world

289
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,799
that we have no contact with in many ways?

290
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,799
Can I add this?

291
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,279
A lost world that often repulses us.

292
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,119
A lost world that when we see their culture,

293
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,839
when we see the degeneracy of what they do and how they live,

294
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,000
hey, I'm talking about our culture.

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,880
And then across the globe, how do I have that heart help me?

296
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
How do I care about them?

297
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,079
How do I see them and feel compassion?

298
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,479
How do I make myself willing to be sacrificial for them?

299
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:12,399
I remember this, that but for the grace of God, that's me.

300
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:16,839
But for the grace of God, I would be what they are.

301
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:22,000
And only by the grace of God was I pulled from that fire.

302
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,679
And I must remind myself of this,

303
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:32,399
that God loves every single one of them.

304
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,799
I don't know about you, but sometimes I

305
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,639
want to go to West Virginia and buy 300 acres or more

306
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,679
in the deepest, darkest holler you've ever seen.

307
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,760
I want to go all the way back in that holler at the front of it.

308
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,320
I want to build a gate and a wall.

309
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,399
I want my wife, my three kids, my seven grandkids,

310
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,639
and both my friends, I want them to be in there

311
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,159
and seal that gate and say, leave us alone.

312
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,599
But that is not our purpose.

313
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:14,839
And those people that often we are repulsed by their behavior, God's Son died for them.

314
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:21,719
And they are as valuable to God as you and I will ever be.

315
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:26,999
You and I have to see not with our eyes, but God's eyes.

316
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:31,799
The songwriter put it this way, and forgive my voice.

317
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:44,639
Let me see this world, dear Lord, as though I were looking through your eyes.

318
00:20:44,639 --> 00:21:03,519
A world of men who don't want you, Lord, but a world for which you died.

319
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:22,439
Let me kneel with you in the garden, blur my eyes with tears of agony, for if once

320
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:32,479
I could see this world the way you see.

321
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:39,319
I just know I'd serve you more faithfully.

322
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,799
I need to go still further.

323
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,399
Third, I would say this.

324
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,279
We need to live beyond our means.

325
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,659
Boy, I want to be careful how I say that.

326
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,059
You have never met a tighter man than me.

327
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:04,979
I do not live beyond my means, but I do have faith.

328
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:07,179
And I ask God to increase my faith.

329
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,939
I love what Paul says in verse 15, not boasting of things without our measure, that is of

330
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:16,899
other men's labors, but having hope.

331
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:25,819
When your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly.

332
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:28,339
What is Paul saying?

333
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:35,939
Paul is writing this to a local church, and he's saying, you're my hope.

334
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,819
You're my hope.

335
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,779
The Sadarskis are here this morning.

336
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:43,139
We are their hope.

337
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:49,219
God has called them to go to Poland, a needy, needy, dark field.

338
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:54,039
It will be a hard, hard work.

339
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,839
They don't have the means to get there by themselves.

340
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,919
They are here because we are their hope.

341
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,559
And you know what they're praying?

342
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,359
They are praying that our faith is enlarged.

343
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:14,479
They're praying that our hearts are touched, that we see the need, that we look beyond

344
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:21,839
our comfort zone, that we look beyond our convenience, that we look beyond our own needs,

345
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:29,399
and we see a world, a world of people dying without Christ, not knowing the gospel.

346
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,239
And they are praying that our faith is enlarged.

347
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,239
Why?

348
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:41,639
So that we can support them to go to Poland to preach the gospel to people who need to

349
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,759
know Jesus Christ.

350
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,159
And Paul is saying, that's my prayer.

351
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,439
My prayer is that your faith is increased.

352
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:58,919
I would remind you that I think the Lord's favorite kind of giving is sacrificial giving.

353
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:06,999
I think the Lord loves it when His people see the needs of others and make a decision.

354
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,739
I will put my comfort aside.

355
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:18,079
I will put my convenience aside so that I can give so that their need can be met.

356
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,999
You say, why do you think the Lord loves that?

357
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,999
Well He proved it.

358
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,679
He gave His own Son.

359
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,739
He looked on our need and saw that there was no way that our need could be met other than

360
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:37,439
His Son coming and dying in our place, being the sacrifice for our sin, paying the penalty

361
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:43,199
for our sin, and then in a transaction that I won't fully understand until I get to heaven,

362
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:49,719
when I come to the cross and I believe what Jesus has done for me on the cross at Calvary,

363
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:58,479
and I ask Him through His work to be my Savior, my sin goes on Him and His righteousness comes

364
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,519
on me.

365
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,999
And when God looks at me, He no longer sees my sin.

366
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:08,599
He sees the righteousness of His Son, Jesus.

367
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:18,919
My goodness, Jesus gave His life for us, and then God looks at us as believers and says,

368
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,319
They have a need?

369
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,799
They have a need?

370
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:30,159
Is there any way that you would be sacrificial and meet their need?

371
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,639
There was a day when Jesus said to His disciples, let's go observe people giving.

372
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,359
That ought to sober us.

373
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,879
Let's go watch people give.

374
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:46,799
And they went down to the women's court of the temple, that's where the benevolence offerings

375
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,799
were given.

376
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:53,359
And it's very interesting, the boxes that were used were a box and it had a long metal

377
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,679
flute that opened up, and you would come by and you would drop your coins in and they

378
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,519
would rattle all the way down, and then the priests would come and take those and distribute

379
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,199
them to people that had great needs.

380
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:11,199
And it's there that Jesus stood with His disciples and He observed the people giving.

381
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:16,559
There was a custom, it's an ugly custom, but people who wanted to be seen and wanted to

382
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,719
be appreciated and praised who were giving large amounts would actually hire people to

383
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:29,159
run before them and even trumpeters to blow trumpets to gather a crowd so that they could

384
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,239
be observed in giving huge amounts.

385
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,919
And so, you know, like your pastor does.

386
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,159
And so they heard the trumpets blowing, they saw the people coming, the oors and the aars,

387
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:49,079
and men would come by and they would drop great amounts into these boxes and ooh, aahs,

388
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,999
the coins would tinkle down into the box and then after they were properly appreciated

389
00:26:53,999 --> 00:27:00,239
they would pass off and all that was done and kind of in the trail of all this Jesus

390
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:04,399
notices a little lady.

391
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:09,319
And she's coming all by herself and there's no trumpets blowing and there's no oors and

392
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,319
aars.

393
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:16,559
As a matter of fact, nobody even cares that she's there because most people think, well,

394
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,999
she probably should be receiving from the box, not giving to the box, but she has two

395
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:31,519
mites and she drops those two mites into that box and Jesus says something to His disciples

396
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,999
that is absolutely shocking to Him.

397
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:44,479
He turns to them and He says, this little widow, she's given more than all the rest.

398
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:50,799
And the disciples look at, Lord, you saw the coins go in, you heard the noise that they

399
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,639
made and her little two mites barely made a tinkling sound as they went down.

400
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:58,399
There's no way she gave the most.

401
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,599
And then He explained a principle that you and I need to understand.

402
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,199
You see, she gave the most in this sense.

403
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:12,319
The men that came by gave out of their abundance.

404
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,039
What's that mean?

405
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,759
It means they gave what was comfortable to give.

406
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,359
They gave what they knew they could do without.

407
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,899
They gave what they knew they could replace.

408
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,999
They gave what was convenient to give.

409
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:36,679
And the difference between them and her was, Jesus says, she gave all she had.

410
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,079
Now the point is not the only way we please the Lord is to give all we have.

411
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,979
We can.

412
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:46,239
But the point is this.

413
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:53,319
The Lord loves and respects when people will say to themselves there's a greater need.

414
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,599
There's a greater good.

415
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:02,799
And even if it makes me a little bit uncomfortable, and even if it makes a little bit inconvenient,

416
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:10,719
to give to meet that need is greater in eternity and will be greater in my life than can be

417
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,859
imagined.

418
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,679
That's what I challenge you with this morning.

419
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,239
The Apostle Paul says go beyond.

420
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,159
Go beyond your measure.

421
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,959
God can bless and use us.

422
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:28,799
Have a vision for beyond your borders.

423
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,199
See that world.

424
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:33,159
Be brokenhearted for that world.

425
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,879
And then he says this, sacrifice.

426
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,519
Go beyond what is comfortable.

427
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,679
Go beyond what is convenient and you say, well, what will happen?

428
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,519
God will bless.

429
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,519
God will provide.

430
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,539
You see, too often I think we lead our lives timidly.

431
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,859
We offer only out of our abundance or that which is convenient to offer.

432
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:02,399
We truly love the Lord.

433
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,919
I'm not suggesting we don't,

434
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,179
and I think we even see the need.

435
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,619
It's just that bit too far.

436
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,939
One last, well, two last.

437
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,119
Never believe a preacher when he says finally.

438
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,699
There's seven more finales coming, but quickly.

439
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,659
My favorite story in the word of God

440
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,579
is Elijah and that widow.

441
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:32,699
And God says to Elijah, Elijah, I want you to leave,

442
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:37,519
I want you to go up, and this widow is going to sustain thee.

443
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,059
Now, can I tell you, in a Baptist preacher's heart,

444
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:43,659
and I am alluding to Elijah as a Baptist preacher,

445
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,939
we do not want to be sustained by widows.

446
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:49,099
We want to sustain widows.

447
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:53,839
And so this is a completely difficult situation,

448
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,019
but Elijah is told and Elijah obeys,

449
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:00,819
and Elijah goes up and knocks on the widow's door

450
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,519
and says, hey, the Lord has sent me,

451
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,559
and you're to take care of me,

452
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,639
and what do you got to eat?

453
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,759
That's the Edwards version.

454
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,039
And she says, well, to be honest with you, Mr. Prophet,

455
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,179
all I have is enough barrel in the meal

456
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,639
and enough oil in the cruise

457
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:20,279
to make my son and myself a little cake.

458
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,679
My plan was a good one.

459
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,699
We were going to eat those and die.

460
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:29,699
And Elijah says this, make me a cake first.

461
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,919
Could you have said it?

462
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,619
I mean, the words would have choked in my throat,

463
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,479
but it's what God told him to do.

464
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,079
Sometimes people will say to me,

465
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,419
you're preaching on giving, you're preaching on sacrifice.

466
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,199
I know, not because it's what I would choose to preach on,

467
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:53,259
it's because God put it in here.

468
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:57,699
And he says, make me a cake first.

469
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:02,379
And here is the most amazing part of the entire story.

470
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,819
She has the faith to do it.

471
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,939
And she makes that cake and sits down there,

472
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:14,339
and the Prophet sits down at that table.

473
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,939
And if you think it was hard for him

474
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,459
to ask her to make the cake,

475
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,919
now he eats it in front of them.

476
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,759
And then says, go make yourself a cake.

477
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,799
You just ate it.

478
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,799
She goes to that barrel.

479
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,439
And you know what's in it?

480
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,359
Enough.

481
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,959
Enough for her and her son.

482
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,319
You know what's in the cruise?

483
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,319
Enough oil.

484
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,679
Hey, you know what's there tomorrow?

485
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,019
Enough.

486
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,679
You know what's there the next day?

487
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:47,679
Enough.

488
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,719
Now, if you knew my heart and how weak my faith was,

489
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:54,399
I would say to the Lord, would you just fill it up?

490
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,519
Every day I come back and there's enough.

491
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm just saying to you that God loves

492
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,959
when people obey his word and are willing to sacrifice.

493
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,639
And then God, beyond their measure,

494
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:10,479
can work in their lives and do great things.

495
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,559
Great things.

496
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,359
Thousands of years later,

497
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,439
we're still talking about a lady

498
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:20,079
who had the faith to give what God wanted her to give.

499
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,419
And she never did without.

500
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,359
One last.

501
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:29,239
1904, a young man graduated from high school.

502
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,859
His name was William Borden.

503
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,839
And Borden, if you recognize that name,

504
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,839
if you're my age, you remember Elsie the cow.

505
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,079
And that was Elsie the cow of the great Borden dairy,

506
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,879
food, all that process and all that.

507
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:47,199
And William Borden was going to be the heir

508
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,239
to all of that business.

509
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,159
He was gonna be a very wealthy man.

510
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,159
As a graduation gift from high school,

511
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,439
his parents gave him a trip around the world.

512
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,159
That's what you got, isn't it?

513
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,759
Yeah, a trip around the world.

514
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,639
And his dad wanted to broaden his business horizons,

515
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,119
wanted him to really get a feel for what it would be

516
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,879
to be a tycoon of the world, you know.

517
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,479
And just a part of the story,

518
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,000
Mrs. Borden was a saved lady,

519
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
had taught her son the word of God, he knew the Lord.

520
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,879
And on this world tour,

521
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,399
instead of getting his visions for business broadened,

522
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,079
God called him to be a missionary.

523
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,199
And when he came home from the trip,

524
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,879
he told his dad, hey,

525
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,599
God has called me to the mission field.

526
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,799
He had seen a certain people while he was in China,

527
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,639
the Kanzu people, and God had laid a burden on his heart

528
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,679
to reach the Kanzu people.

529
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,439
Oh, his dad was upset.

530
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:49,879
I sent you to learn how to be a businessman.

531
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,519
He finally came to the place where he thought,

532
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,879
well, we're gonna send you to college,

533
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,539
you'll lose this silliness.

534
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,239
You'll understand that business is the way to go.

535
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,039
They sent him to Yale University, don't advise that now,

536
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,439
but back then, when he got there, he became an evangelist.

537
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:05,159
He started leading Bible studies,

538
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,919
led his roommates to the Lord,

539
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,759
founded the mission in New Haven,

540
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:10,519
leading people to the Lord.

541
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,519
He just never lost the fervor.

542
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,839
When he graduated, he followed through on his promise.

543
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,679
Now, one interesting thing, the Kanzu people,

544
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,079
though they lived in the Mongolia region,

545
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,719
were Arabic-speaking people.

546
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,479
And so to reach them, he had to learn the Arabic language.

547
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:32,239
And he, after graduation, went to Cairo to learn Arabic

548
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,519
so that he could go to Mongolia to reach these people

549
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,000
while in Cairo.

550
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,079
25 days after he was in Cairo,

551
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,919
he contracted spinal meningitis.

552
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:48,679
Today, it's a dangerous disease, but we can work with it.

553
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,639
We have antibiotics.

554
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,239
They didn't have antibiotics then that could do it,

555
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,239
or certainly not in Cairo.

556
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,239
30 days after he arrived in Cairo, he was dead.

557
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:04,239
Oh, the Chicago papers, what a waste!

558
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,759
Wasted life!

559
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,879
They found his Bible.

560
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,479
He was a journalist.

561
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,279
And in his Bible, this young man had written these words,

562
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,359
no reserves, no retreats, no regrets.

563
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,879
No regrets.

564
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:29,079
He had purposed to live his life in God's hands.

565
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,159
And though it did not pan out the way that he thought,

566
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,719
he gave his life for the cause of the Lord,

567
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,599
and he had no regrets.

568
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,599
With this, I'm done.

569
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,959
I lived 23 years without knowing the Lord.

570
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,079
I regret 23 years that were not given to the Lord

571
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,519
in my life.

572
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,679
I don't want to finish my life with regrets.

573
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,759
I wanna make the choices that God wants me to make.

574
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,439
I wanna do the work that God wants me to do.

575
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:09,119
I wanna be the man that God wants me to be,

576
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,319
because I don't wanna stand before the Lord and say,

577
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,000
ah, I knew what you laid on my heart,

578
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but again, the songwriter would put it this way.

579
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,559
By and by, when I look on his face,

580
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,719
beautiful face, thorn-shadowed face,

581
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:44,959
by and by, when I look on his face,

582
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,679
I'll wish I had given him more,

583
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,519
more, so much more,

584
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,599
more of my life than I ever gave before.

585
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,599
By and by, when I look on his face,

586
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,479
I'll wish I'd given him more.

587
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,919
Nobody will stand there and say,

588
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:26,139
boy, do I regret getting that burden for missions.

589
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,759
Nobody will stand there and say,

590
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:31,919
man, do I regret being in that conference

591
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,239
and having my heart to,

592
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,959
boy, do I regret not taking more of the money that I had

593
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:40,440
and not giving it to the cause of missions,

594
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,239
but we could have gone to Disney World.

595
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,479
Nobody will say that.

596
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:52,959
All of us will wish we had given more,

597
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,919
we had done more, we had surrendered more,

598
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,359
we had lived for him more.

599
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:04,679
That's why moments like this are important.

600
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,119
When we make choices about who we will be,

601
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,479
how we will live, what we will give,

602
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,760
how will we allocate the resources

603
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,440
that he's so blessed us with,

604
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:22,479
no reserves, no retreats, no regrets.

605
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,880
Would you pray with me?

606
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,119
Father, we thank you for these few minutes you've given us

607
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,119
and we come to this moment of invitation

608
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,760
and we ask you to please make it clear to us

609
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,039
what you want us to do.

610
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,719
Lord, you have so blessed us abundantly.

611
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,279
And sometimes we turn our eyes away

612
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:49,919
from the needs of the world

613
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,519
when really you want us to look deeply.

614
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,679
God, would you touch our hearts

615
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,079
and would you help us to.

616
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:09,039
purpose this year to be more willing to sacrifice, more generous in our giving

617
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:15,199
for the needs of others? Would you help us to see that it's the example that you

618
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:22,159
set? God, I pray for those who are here that you would have them to lift up

619
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:28,439
their eyes and see the need. Maybe you're calling their life to be one of those

620
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:35,239
that go. Whatever it is, I pray that you would burden us to see beyond ourselves,

621
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:42,359
to go beyond ourselves, to be willing to be used of you in a great way, giving,

622
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:48,919
praying, going. I pray for that one here that may not know Christ as their Savior.

623
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:57,239
I pray, Lord, that you would help them to see that even today, if they will confess

624
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:03,239
their need—indeed, we are sinners, we know it—and that the provision of the

625
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:09,479
cross is there if they will call upon Jesus to be saved. For whosoever shall

626
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:16,479
call upon his name shall be saved. Lord, I pray you'd burden their heart. Now work

627
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:21,599
in us, change us, and help us to see it, I pray. Just before I conclude my prayer, I

628
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,959
wonder if there'd be one or two that would say, you know, Preacher, God has

629
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:27,359
spoken to my heart.
