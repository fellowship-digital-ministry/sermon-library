WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Well, again, it's an honor to be here and thank you for being here.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.239
And I pray that together we can learn a lot this week and that I can be a blessing.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.120
You've already been a blessing to me.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.780
Thank you so much.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.360
Take your Bible, if you would, and turn to 2 Corinthians 10.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.440
While you're turning there, I have to make this comment.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.920
I don't know how many years I've known Joe.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.920
Joe left.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.479
I guess, oh, he's back there, okay.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:44.819
But honestly, he was probably six or seven years old when we first met, and he was about

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.680
to my knee.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.680
And now, many years later, I don't make it to his knee anymore.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.560
And I only see him every couple of years now, and I just stand amazed at how the Lord

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.439
is prospering him in his height.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.479
Now, the Lord is working with me in a similar way.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.080
It's just this direction.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.000
So I love Joe.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Amen.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.639
Take your Bible, 2 Corinthians 10.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:21.220
Let's notice in verse 14, Paul speaking, for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:24.540
as though we reached not unto you.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.099
For we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ, not boasting of things

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:39.860
without our measure, that is, of other men's labors, but having hope when your faith is

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.040
increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, to preach

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.319
the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:03.199
made ready to our hand, but he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.199
Let's pray.

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:09.000
Father, we're grateful for this time you've given us to be together.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.800
We're thankful, Lord, for this church and for the testimony of this church, their love

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.240
for missions, their concern for the world and for the need of lost souls to know Christ.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.679
Lord, it is a valid question to ask ourselves, do we care?

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.800
Do I care?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.639
Thank you for that message and song.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.880
And we ask you now, Holy Spirit, this is your word, we are your people, and I pray that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.759
you would do what no preacher can do.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.720
Would you speak to the heart of every individual, expose to them their need and expose what

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.520
your word wants us to understand, convict us and help us, I pray.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.880
In Jesus' name, amen.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.559
I'll make an obvious statement, the world is immense, isn't it?

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:04.759
Sometimes I just ponder how big, not only geographically, the world is, although that's

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:12.279
astounding, and to me amazing that with modern travel we can cover thousands and thousands

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.839
of miles in hours instead of weeks and months, as it once was.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:24.000
But I'm also always amazed at the size of the world and the sheer population.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I am told, and I don't know, but some people say there are as many as 8 billion people

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.919
on planet earth.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:38.279
To be honest with you, I get lost after a hundred, so I don't know what 8 billion is,

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:44.639
but I know that it's an incomprehensible number by one individual.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:51.639
I think of how large it is in diversity, how many languages are on planet earth, how many

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.039
people groups are on planet earth.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:04:01.119
And then to understand that probably a third of them have not only never heard a clear

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:06.039
presentation of the gospel, some of them have never even heard the name of Jesus.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:13.039
And when I think of how large it is, then I'm amazed by this thought, that as large

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.720
and as diverse as all the peoples and cultures and languages are, there is one name by which

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.480
every one of those souls must come to for salvation, and that is through Jesus Christ.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.600
There aren't many ways.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.040
There aren't many names.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:37.160
Languages don't change the need of a soul.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.480
Language doesn't alter the need of a soul.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.640
Culture doesn't change what every soul needs.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.640
Every soul needs the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.920
When I think about how immense the world is and how great God's love for every individual

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.119
is, then I come to this thought as well.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.079
I'm somewhat embarrassed about how small my world is.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:12.559
Many days and too many ways and too many days I live my life concerned only about the three

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.519
foot circle that is around me.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:17.760
What impacts me?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.839
What is in my day that day?

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:26.839
What's my need without ever giving a real thought to what the need of this world is?

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.679
I'm challenged when I read about men like the Apostle Paul and passages like we're looking

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:40.679
at this morning, to be a man like Paul who lived beyond his world.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.019
That's my message this morning, living beyond our world.

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:52.959
Two times in the verses we read, Paul uses that word under the inspiration of the Spirit,

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:55.519
but he said he wants to go beyond his measure.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:59.519
He wants to preach in the regions beyond where he is.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:05.959
I think he alludes to the fact that he lives beyond his means, and I'll be very careful

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.720
to explain that in just a few moments.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.359
But I think in every one of our lives, every one of our hearts as believers, there ought

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:22.359
to be a sense, a burden to live beyond who and where we are.

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:29.279
I don't mean to be negative in my preaching, but folks, we find ourselves living, I believe,

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.839
in the most narcissistic generation that has ever populated planet earth.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.440
It is all about me.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.880
It is, we don't live the we life, we live the me life.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.880
And even believers have to purposely, intentionally break out of that and say, Lord, help me to

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.519
see beyond me.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:57.079
And like the Apostle Paul, be willing to live beyond our measure.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:04.079
Be willing to live beyond reaching, beyond our border, even living beyond our means.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.320
And if those things I want to talk about for a few moments this morning, I want you to

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.359
think about what Paul means when he says he lived beyond his measure.

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:22.359
Look again at verse 14, for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.440
reach not unto you.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.959
Understand this, that there were times, often, when the Apostle Paul and the church at Corinth

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:35.720
had kind of an adversarial relationship.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.200
The people at Corinth did not like Paul's authority, I suppose they didn't like anyone's

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.200
authority over them, and sometimes they chafed at what Paul demanded of them or said to them

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.320
or preached to them.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.959
And at this moment, what they're feeling, what they're saying is, Paul, you're challenging

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.600
us to reach a world.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.720
You're challenging us to take the gospel to every creature.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.119
But Paul, don't you understand we have our own problems?

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:09.959
Don't you understand, Paul, here at Corinth, we've got issues here.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.799
In our lives, we have issues here.

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:19.160
You just keep telling us to reach beyond and reach beyond, and Paul, you're a dreamer.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.920
You're dreaming if you think the gospel can go to every place in the globe and everybody

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.040
ought to hear.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.239
And I love what Paul's answer is to them.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:34.960
In essence, he says, we reached you.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.440
We reached you.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.840
You see, there's always been people who would doubt whether the gospel could ever go from

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.880
Jerusalem to Samaria.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.359
I mean, the gospel is meant for Jerusalem.

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:51.359
But you know what?

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:55.960
God intended it to go beyond Jerusalem, and he had to send some persecution to get it

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960
done.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.799
But they did take the gospel to Samaria, and you know what?

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.960
Samaritans did get saved.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.239
And not only did it go to Samaria, well, maybe it could go to Samaria, because they've

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:15.640
got some linkage to the Jewish, the Hebrew culture, but it could never go to Gentiles.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.799
But it did go to Gentiles.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:23.880
It went to Antioch, and the people at Antioch had a great revival there and saved.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.799
A great church was established at Antioch among Gentiles, and by the way, it became

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:35.119
the model church for modern missions there in Antioch.

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:39.039
And by the way, that's where they were first called Christians.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:44.119
I'm just saying there's always been people who said it couldn't be done.

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:50.679
There's always people who said it could never jump an ocean, but the gospel did jump an

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:51.679
ocean.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:58.039
It jumped the Aegean, and Paul took the gospel to Philippi, and Thessalonica, Berea, Corinth,

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.919
and oh, by the way, we sit

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.399
in this room this morning because the gospel jumped

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:04.959
another ocean.

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.639
It jumped the Atlantic Ocean.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.819
And we are the recipients of the truth of the Word of God

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:14.239
because there is no barrier or border that

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.639
can stop the Word of God.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:21.759
And you and I ought to live with that thought that, yeah,

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:24.199
God can do more than I understand.

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:27.519
God can do more than I can anticipate.

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.519
God can do something.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.239
Listen, if you are concerned just

00:10:32.239 --> 00:10:35.639
about the measure of what can be done in the life

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.959
or through the life of Mike Edwards,

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:40.319
I assure you not much.

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:43.919
But if you pour the Spirit of God and the will of God

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:48.919
into a surrendered Mike Edwards, much can be done.

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:51.139
Fellowship Baptist Church is a spot

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:54.479
on a map in Fairfax County, Virginia.

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:58.359
But pour the Holy Spirit in Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:01.319
and you'd be amazed at the measure of what

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:05.439
God could do in reaching an entire world.

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:09.839
Because it is not our measure that is the difference.

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:14.559
It is God's measure working through us.

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:18.959
Now unto him that is able to exceeding abundantly

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:22.039
above all that we ask or think, according

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.759
to the power that worketh in us.

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:30.959
God is able to do exceeding abundantly great things

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:36.679
through us in this place if we will see and trust and believe

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:38.719
that God can work in us.

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:41.759
The Apostle Paul was a man who lived beyond his own measure,

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.599
his own ability.

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:46.679
He was a man that was willing to live beyond his own borders.

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:50.279
I love what he says in verse 16.

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.879
He wanted to preach the gospel in the regions

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.399
beyond you.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.159
One of the greatest political questions

00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:02.719
we face in our nation today is who and how

00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:04.959
do we allow people to come into our country,

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:07.439
both legally and illegally?

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:09.959
To be honest with you, that's a question for other minds

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.399
than mine.

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:14.639
The great question that our church ought to be pondering

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.479
is not who comes in.

00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:20.439
It ought to be how do we get our folks to go out?

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:23.959
How do we get people to see the great need

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.759
of reaching this lost world?

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:30.359
Paul was a man who was interested in going beyond,

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:33.359
in reaching beyond his border, if you will.

00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:37.159
He was saved around 42 AD.

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:38.919
That's a long time ago.

00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:41.319
He spent some silent years in the desert

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:44.999
being taught of others and being taught of the Lord

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:46.239
specifically.

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:51.919
Around 46 AD, he began preaching, traveling the world,

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:53.479
preaching the gospel.

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:57.559
And for the next 15 years, he traveled by foot.

00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:59.439
He traveled by ship.

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:02.439
He was supported by others, but also when needed,

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:04.319
worked as a tent maker.

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:05.679
He preached in cities.

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:07.479
He preached in villages.

00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:11.199
He preached both in season and out of season.

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:12.679
He preached in Jerusalem.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.999
He preached in North Africa.

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:16.799
He preached in Asia Minor.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.239
He preached in Greece, the islands

00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:22.039
of the Mediterranean, Italy, and even

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.679
in the capital of the Roman Empire itself,

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.079
he preached the gospel in Rome.

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:29.319
And I believe if he would have had

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:33.719
modern means of transportation, Paul literally

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:38.679
would have reached his entire known world.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:42.919
He preached to Jews, but he also preached to pagans.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.359
He preached to paupers and kings,

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:48.679
to anyone that would listen, to include those who

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:52.479
kept him in chains in prison.

00:13:52.479 --> 00:13:54.319
There was no border.

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:56.479
There was no barrier that could keep him out

00:13:56.479 --> 00:13:58.639
if it was the Lord's will that he go.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:03.079
He literally lived the Great Commission.

00:14:03.079 --> 00:14:07.479
When we read Regents Beyond You, sometimes we

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.839
think, well, that's an interesting phrase,

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:16.759
but we forget the life that Paul led to accomplish that.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:20.599
And I don't know about you, but what that creates in my heart

00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:26.239
is not necessarily a guilt. It creates in me

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:30.079
a question of, what do I do?

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:34.479
What's my commitment to reach a lost world in the way

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:35.839
that Paul reached it?

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.679
As I was studying for this message,

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:42.239
I noticed that phrase, Regents Beyond.

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:45.399
And in one of the commentators I read,

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:48.759
he said there's no way to really quantify Regents Beyond,

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:51.759
because it depends on where you are.

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.959
But he said the best way to understand Regents Beyond

00:14:54.959 --> 00:15:01.119
is this, still further, still further.

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:03.799
And I was so struck by that.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:07.319
Can I tell you one of the fears of my life?

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:10.599
Here's one of the fears in the heart of Mike Edwards.

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:14.159
I've been saved since 1975.

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:17.439
I've been in ministry soon after.

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:19.199
I have studied my Bible.

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.719
I have preached.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.119
I have been part of programs.

00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:24.359
I've won souls.

00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:25.279
I've prayed.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.559
You say, are you boasting?

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.319
No, I'm just telling you.

00:15:28.319 --> 00:15:30.199
I've been at it for a while.

00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:31.919
And can I tell you one of the fears

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:35.119
and one of the dangers in my life?

00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:42.319
To come to the place where I think I've done enough.

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:44.199
To think that I've learned enough.

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:46.239
To think that I've studied enough.

00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:48.759
To think that I've given of myself enough.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.879
To think that I've given enough.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:53.439
To think that there's nothing else for me.

00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:56.119
To think that someone else should share the burden.

00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:59.079
To think that someone else should do the work.

00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:02.639
Hey, I hope that God gives me the grace

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:09.279
for every day of my life to say there is still further I can go.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:12.479
There is still more that I can do.

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:15.599
There is still someone I can reach.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:19.719
There is still more of my heart to surrender to the Lord.

00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:24.039
And may God help all of us to guard our hearts

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:29.559
against being content with what we have done.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:33.599
There is still more that I can give.

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:37.719
There is still more that I can sacrifice.

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:44.559
There is still more that I need to grow in in my life still further.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:49.759
One of my heroes of the faith is a man named C.T. Studd.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.439
What a name.

00:16:51.439 --> 00:16:53.679
And C.T. Studd, it won't mean much to us,

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:59.999
but in the early 1900s, C.T. Studd was a great cricket player.

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.039
I mean, it was a very big deal.

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.159
He was a professional cricket player.

00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:07.919
He made a big mistake.

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.879
One night he was invited to a moody rally, and he went.

00:17:11.879 --> 00:17:13.759
And he got saved.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:15.959
And when he got saved, all of a sudden cricket

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.719
wasn't as important to him.

00:17:17.719 --> 00:17:21.159
And long story short, he became a great missionary,

00:17:21.159 --> 00:17:24.919
giving up that career and all the notoriety that went with it

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.999
and served in many places across the globe.

00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:29.959
But he knew how to turn a phrase.

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:32.199
And let me just give you two of them.

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:36.759
He said once, some want to live within the sound of a church

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.679
or a chapel bell.

00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:43.559
I want to run a rescue shop within a yard of hell.

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.479
Now, that's a phrase, and that's a preacher,

00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:48.519
and we do stuff like that.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.519
But I love that sentiment, that I'm not

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:54.399
content to just be in the comfortable place.

00:17:54.399 --> 00:17:59.039
I'm not content to just take the easy way, that I want to go

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:01.079
and I want to be used of the Lord.

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:04.319
And if it takes me into the uncomfortable place,

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:07.959
into the inconvenient place, then Lord, so be it.

00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:11.719
There is still further I can go.

00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:19.119
He said this, if Jesus Christ is God and died for me,

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:25.399
then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for him.

00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:26.839
What a heart.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.399
How do you get there?

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:32.839
How do we care about a lost world, a lost world

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:35.799
that we have no contact with in many ways?

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:36.799
Can I add this?

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:41.279
A lost world that often repulses us.

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:44.119
A lost world that when we see their culture,

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:48.839
when we see the degeneracy of what they do and how they live,

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:52.000
hey, I'm talking about our culture.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.880
And then across the globe, how do I have that heart help me?

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.799
How do I care about them?

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:02.079
How do I see them and feel compassion?

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:06.479
How do I make myself willing to be sacrificial for them?

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:12.399
I remember this, that but for the grace of God, that's me.

00:19:12.399 --> 00:19:16.839
But for the grace of God, I would be what they are.

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:22.000
And only by the grace of God was I pulled from that fire.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.679
And I must remind myself of this,

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:32.399
that God loves every single one of them.

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:34.799
I don't know about you, but sometimes I

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.639
want to go to West Virginia and buy 300 acres or more

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:43.679
in the deepest, darkest holler you've ever seen.

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:46.760
I want to go all the way back in that holler at the front of it.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.320
I want to build a gate and a wall.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.399
I want my wife, my three kids, my seven grandkids,

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:55.639
and both my friends, I want them to be in there

00:19:55.639 --> 00:20:00.159
and seal that gate and say, leave us alone.

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:04.599
But that is not our purpose.

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:14.839
And those people that often we are repulsed by their behavior, God's Son died for them.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:21.719
And they are as valuable to God as you and I will ever be.

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:26.999
You and I have to see not with our eyes, but God's eyes.

00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:31.799
The songwriter put it this way, and forgive my voice.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:44.639
Let me see this world, dear Lord, as though I were looking through your eyes.

00:20:44.639 --> 00:21:03.519
A world of men who don't want you, Lord, but a world for which you died.

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:22.439
Let me kneel with you in the garden, blur my eyes with tears of agony, for if once

00:21:22.439 --> 00:21:32.479
I could see this world the way you see.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:39.319
I just know I'd serve you more faithfully.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:44.799
I need to go still further.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:48.399
Third, I would say this.

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:50.279
We need to live beyond our means.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:53.659
Boy, I want to be careful how I say that.

00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:58.059
You have never met a tighter man than me.

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:04.979
I do not live beyond my means, but I do have faith.

00:22:04.979 --> 00:22:07.179
And I ask God to increase my faith.

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:12.939
I love what Paul says in verse 15, not boasting of things without our measure, that is of

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:16.899
other men's labors, but having hope.

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:25.819
When your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly.

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:28.339
What is Paul saying?

00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:35.939
Paul is writing this to a local church, and he's saying, you're my hope.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:37.819
You're my hope.

00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:40.779
The Sadarskis are here this morning.

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:43.139
We are their hope.

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:49.219
God has called them to go to Poland, a needy, needy, dark field.

00:22:49.219 --> 00:22:54.039
It will be a hard, hard work.

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.839
They don't have the means to get there by themselves.

00:22:57.839 --> 00:23:00.919
They are here because we are their hope.

00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:02.559
And you know what they're praying?

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:07.359
They are praying that our faith is enlarged.

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:14.479
They're praying that our hearts are touched, that we see the need, that we look beyond

00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:21.839
our comfort zone, that we look beyond our convenience, that we look beyond our own needs,

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:29.399
and we see a world, a world of people dying without Christ, not knowing the gospel.

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:33.239
And they are praying that our faith is enlarged.

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:34.239
Why?

00:23:34.239 --> 00:23:41.639
So that we can support them to go to Poland to preach the gospel to people who need to

00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:43.759
know Jesus Christ.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:46.159
And Paul is saying, that's my prayer.

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:51.439
My prayer is that your faith is increased.

00:23:51.439 --> 00:23:58.919
I would remind you that I think the Lord's favorite kind of giving is sacrificial giving.

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:06.999
I think the Lord loves it when His people see the needs of others and make a decision.

00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:10.739
I will put my comfort aside.

00:24:10.739 --> 00:24:18.079
I will put my convenience aside so that I can give so that their need can be met.

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:19.999
You say, why do you think the Lord loves that?

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:20.999
Well He proved it.

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:23.679
He gave His own Son.

00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:29.739
He looked on our need and saw that there was no way that our need could be met other than

00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:37.439
His Son coming and dying in our place, being the sacrifice for our sin, paying the penalty

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:43.199
for our sin, and then in a transaction that I won't fully understand until I get to heaven,

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:49.719
when I come to the cross and I believe what Jesus has done for me on the cross at Calvary,

00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:58.479
and I ask Him through His work to be my Savior, my sin goes on Him and His righteousness comes

00:24:58.479 --> 00:24:59.519
on me.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:02.999
And when God looks at me, He no longer sees my sin.

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:08.599
He sees the righteousness of His Son, Jesus.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:18.919
My goodness, Jesus gave His life for us, and then God looks at us as believers and says,

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:21.319
They have a need?

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.799
They have a need?

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:30.159
Is there any way that you would be sacrificial and meet their need?

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:37.639
There was a day when Jesus said to His disciples, let's go observe people giving.

00:25:37.639 --> 00:25:39.359
That ought to sober us.

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:41.879
Let's go watch people give.

00:25:41.879 --> 00:25:46.799
And they went down to the women's court of the temple, that's where the benevolence offerings

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:47.799
were given.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:53.359
And it's very interesting, the boxes that were used were a box and it had a long metal

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:58.679
flute that opened up, and you would come by and you would drop your coins in and they

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:03.519
would rattle all the way down, and then the priests would come and take those and distribute

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:06.199
them to people that had great needs.

00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:11.199
And it's there that Jesus stood with His disciples and He observed the people giving.

00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:16.559
There was a custom, it's an ugly custom, but people who wanted to be seen and wanted to

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:22.719
be appreciated and praised who were giving large amounts would actually hire people to

00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:29.159
run before them and even trumpeters to blow trumpets to gather a crowd so that they could

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:32.239
be observed in giving huge amounts.

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:35.919
And so, you know, like your pastor does.

00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:42.159
And so they heard the trumpets blowing, they saw the people coming, the oors and the aars,

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:49.079
and men would come by and they would drop great amounts into these boxes and ooh, aahs,

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:53.999
the coins would tinkle down into the box and then after they were properly appreciated

00:26:53.999 --> 00:27:00.239
they would pass off and all that was done and kind of in the trail of all this Jesus

00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:04.399
notices a little lady.

00:27:04.399 --> 00:27:09.319
And she's coming all by herself and there's no trumpets blowing and there's no oors and

00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:10.319
aars.

00:27:10.479 --> 00:27:16.559
As a matter of fact, nobody even cares that she's there because most people think, well,

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:22.999
she probably should be receiving from the box, not giving to the box, but she has two

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:31.519
mites and she drops those two mites into that box and Jesus says something to His disciples

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:34.999
that is absolutely shocking to Him.

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:44.479
He turns to them and He says, this little widow, she's given more than all the rest.

00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:50.799
And the disciples look at, Lord, you saw the coins go in, you heard the noise that they

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:56.639
made and her little two mites barely made a tinkling sound as they went down.

00:27:56.639 --> 00:27:58.399
There's no way she gave the most.

00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:03.599
And then He explained a principle that you and I need to understand.

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:07.199
You see, she gave the most in this sense.

00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:12.319
The men that came by gave out of their abundance.

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:14.039
What's that mean?

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:18.759
It means they gave what was comfortable to give.

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:21.359
They gave what they knew they could do without.

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:24.899
They gave what they knew they could replace.

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:27.999
They gave what was convenient to give.

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:36.679
And the difference between them and her was, Jesus says, she gave all she had.

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:42.079
Now the point is not the only way we please the Lord is to give all we have.

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.979
We can.

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:46.239
But the point is this.

00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:53.319
The Lord loves and respects when people will say to themselves there's a greater need.

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:55.599
There's a greater good.

00:28:55.599 --> 00:29:02.799
And even if it makes me a little bit uncomfortable, and even if it makes a little bit inconvenient,

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:10.719
to give to meet that need is greater in eternity and will be greater in my life than can be

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:12.859
imagined.

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:15.679
That's what I challenge you with this morning.

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:19.239
The Apostle Paul says go beyond.

00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:22.159
Go beyond your measure.

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:24.959
God can bless and use us.

00:29:24.959 --> 00:29:28.799
Have a vision for beyond your borders.

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.199
See that world.

00:29:30.199 --> 00:29:33.159
Be brokenhearted for that world.

00:29:33.159 --> 00:29:36.879
And then he says this, sacrifice.

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:39.519
Go beyond what is comfortable.

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:45.679
Go beyond what is convenient and you say, well, what will happen?

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.519
God will bless.

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.519
God will provide.

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:54.539
You see, too often I think we lead our lives timidly.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:59.859
We offer only out of our abundance or that which is convenient to offer.

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:02.399
We truly love the Lord.

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:03.919
I'm not suggesting we don't,

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:06.179
and I think we even see the need.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:10.619
It's just that bit too far.

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:13.939
One last, well, two last.

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:18.119
Never believe a preacher when he says finally.

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:21.699
There's seven more finales coming, but quickly.

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:25.659
My favorite story in the word of God

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:27.579
is Elijah and that widow.

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:32.699
And God says to Elijah, Elijah, I want you to leave,

00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:37.519
I want you to go up, and this widow is going to sustain thee.

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:40.059
Now, can I tell you, in a Baptist preacher's heart,

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:43.659
and I am alluding to Elijah as a Baptist preacher,

00:30:43.659 --> 00:30:46.939
we do not want to be sustained by widows.

00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:49.099
We want to sustain widows.

00:30:49.979 --> 00:30:53.839
And so this is a completely difficult situation,

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:57.019
but Elijah is told and Elijah obeys,

00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:00.819
and Elijah goes up and knocks on the widow's door

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:03.519
and says, hey, the Lord has sent me,

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:05.559
and you're to take care of me,

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:07.639
and what do you got to eat?

00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:09.759
That's the Edwards version.

00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:13.039
And she says, well, to be honest with you, Mr. Prophet,

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:16.179
all I have is enough barrel in the meal

00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:17.639
and enough oil in the cruise

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:20.279
to make my son and myself a little cake.

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:21.679
My plan was a good one.

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.699
We were going to eat those and die.

00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:29.699
And Elijah says this, make me a cake first.

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:37.919
Could you have said it?

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:40.619
I mean, the words would have choked in my throat,

00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:42.479
but it's what God told him to do.

00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:44.079
Sometimes people will say to me,

00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:47.419
you're preaching on giving, you're preaching on sacrifice.

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:51.199
I know, not because it's what I would choose to preach on,

00:31:51.199 --> 00:31:53.259
it's because God put it in here.

00:31:54.699 --> 00:31:57.699
And he says, make me a cake first.

00:31:57.699 --> 00:32:02.379
And here is the most amazing part of the entire story.

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:05.819
She has the faith to do it.

00:32:08.419 --> 00:32:11.939
And she makes that cake and sits down there,

00:32:11.939 --> 00:32:14.339
and the Prophet sits down at that table.

00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:15.939
And if you think it was hard for him

00:32:15.939 --> 00:32:17.459
to ask her to make the cake,

00:32:17.459 --> 00:32:20.919
now he eats it in front of them.

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.759
And then says, go make yourself a cake.

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:28.799
You just ate it.

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:31.799
She goes to that barrel.

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:34.439
And you know what's in it?

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.359
Enough.

00:32:37.439 --> 00:32:38.959
Enough for her and her son.

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:40.319
You know what's in the cruise?

00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:41.319
Enough oil.

00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:43.679
Hey, you know what's there tomorrow?

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:45.019
Enough.

00:32:45.019 --> 00:32:46.679
You know what's there the next day?

00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:47.679
Enough.

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:50.719
Now, if you knew my heart and how weak my faith was,

00:32:51.479 --> 00:32:54.399
I would say to the Lord, would you just fill it up?

00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:56.519
Every day I come back and there's enough.

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:59.519
I'm just saying to you that God loves

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:03.959
when people obey his word and are willing to sacrifice.

00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:06.639
And then God, beyond their measure,

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:10.479
can work in their lives and do great things.

00:33:10.479 --> 00:33:11.559
Great things.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:13.359
Thousands of years later,

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:15.439
we're still talking about a lady

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:20.079
who had the faith to give what God wanted her to give.

00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:21.419
And she never did without.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:23.359
One last.

00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:29.239
1904, a young man graduated from high school.

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:30.859
His name was William Borden.

00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:34.839
And Borden, if you recognize that name,

00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:37.839
if you're my age, you remember Elsie the cow.

00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:41.079
And that was Elsie the cow of the great Borden dairy,

00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:43.879
food, all that process and all that.

00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:47.199
And William Borden was going to be the heir

00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:49.239
to all of that business.

00:33:49.839 --> 00:33:52.159
He was gonna be a very wealthy man.

00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:55.159
As a graduation gift from high school,

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:58.439
his parents gave him a trip around the world.

00:33:58.439 --> 00:34:00.159
That's what you got, isn't it?

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:02.759
Yeah, a trip around the world.

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:06.639
And his dad wanted to broaden his business horizons,

00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:10.119
wanted him to really get a feel for what it would be

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:12.879
to be a tycoon of the world, you know.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:15.479
And just a part of the story,

00:34:15.479 --> 00:34:18.000
Mrs. Borden was a saved lady,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.119
had taught her son the word of God, he knew the Lord.

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.879
And on this world tour,

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:27.399
instead of getting his visions for business broadened,

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:30.079
God called him to be a missionary.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.199
And when he came home from the trip,

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.879
he told his dad, hey,

00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:36.599
God has called me to the mission field.

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:39.799
He had seen a certain people while he was in China,

00:34:39.799 --> 00:34:43.639
the Kanzu people, and God had laid a burden on his heart

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.679
to reach the Kanzu people.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.439
Oh, his dad was upset.

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:49.879
I sent you to learn how to be a businessman.

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.519
He finally came to the place where he thought,

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:52.879
well, we're gonna send you to college,

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:54.539
you'll lose this silliness.

00:34:54.539 --> 00:34:57.239
You'll understand that business is the way to go.

00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:00.039
They sent him to Yale University, don't advise that now,

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:03.439
but back then, when he got there, he became an evangelist.

00:35:03.439 --> 00:35:05.159
He started leading Bible studies,

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.919
led his roommates to the Lord,

00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:08.759
founded the mission in New Haven,

00:35:08.759 --> 00:35:10.519
leading people to the Lord.

00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:12.519
He just never lost the fervor.

00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:15.839
When he graduated, he followed through on his promise.

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:18.679
Now, one interesting thing, the Kanzu people,

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.079
though they lived in the Mongolia region,

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:23.719
were Arabic-speaking people.

00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:27.479
And so to reach them, he had to learn the Arabic language.

00:35:27.479 --> 00:35:32.239
And he, after graduation, went to Cairo to learn Arabic

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:35.519
so that he could go to Mongolia to reach these people

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:37.000
while in Cairo.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.079
25 days after he was in Cairo,

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:43.919
he contracted spinal meningitis.

00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:48.679
Today, it's a dangerous disease, but we can work with it.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.639
We have antibiotics.

00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:52.239
They didn't have antibiotics then that could do it,

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:54.239
or certainly not in Cairo.

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:59.239
30 days after he arrived in Cairo, he was dead.

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:04.239
Oh, the Chicago papers, what a waste!

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:05.759
Wasted life!

00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:08.879
They found his Bible.

00:36:08.879 --> 00:36:10.479
He was a journalist.

00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:14.279
And in his Bible, this young man had written these words,

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:20.359
no reserves, no retreats, no regrets.

00:36:23.439 --> 00:36:24.879
No regrets.

00:36:24.879 --> 00:36:29.079
He had purposed to live his life in God's hands.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:33.159
And though it did not pan out the way that he thought,

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:36.719
he gave his life for the cause of the Lord,

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:39.599
and he had no regrets.

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:41.599
With this, I'm done.

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:46.959
I lived 23 years without knowing the Lord.

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:53.079
I regret 23 years that were not given to the Lord

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:54.519
in my life.

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:58.679
I don't want to finish my life with regrets.

00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:03.759
I wanna make the choices that God wants me to make.

00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:06.439
I wanna do the work that God wants me to do.

00:37:06.439 --> 00:37:09.119
I wanna be the man that God wants me to be,

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:13.319
because I don't wanna stand before the Lord and say,

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:17.000
ah, I knew what you laid on my heart,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
but again, the songwriter would put it this way.

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:31.559
By and by, when I look on his face,

00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:37.719
beautiful face, thorn-shadowed face,

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:44.959
by and by, when I look on his face,

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:51.679
I'll wish I had given him more,

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:58.519
more, so much more,

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:04.599
more of my life than I ever gave before.

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:10.599
By and by, when I look on his face,

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:18.479
I'll wish I'd given him more.

00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:22.919
Nobody will stand there and say,

00:38:22.919 --> 00:38:26.139
boy, do I regret getting that burden for missions.

00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:28.759
Nobody will stand there and say,

00:38:28.759 --> 00:38:31.919
man, do I regret being in that conference

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:33.239
and having my heart to,

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:37.959
boy, do I regret not taking more of the money that I had

00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:40.440
and not giving it to the cause of missions,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.239
but we could have gone to Disney World.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:46.479
Nobody will say that.

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:52.959
All of us will wish we had given more,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.919
we had done more, we had surrendered more,

00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:01.359
we had lived for him more.

00:39:02.279 --> 00:39:04.679
That's why moments like this are important.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.119
When we make choices about who we will be,

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:12.479
how we will live, what we will give,

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:14.760
how will we allocate the resources

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.440
that he's so blessed us with,

00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:22.479
no reserves, no retreats, no regrets.

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:23.880
Would you pray with me?

00:39:25.719 --> 00:39:28.119
Father, we thank you for these few minutes you've given us

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:31.119
and we come to this moment of invitation

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.760
and we ask you to please make it clear to us

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.039
what you want us to do.

00:39:36.719 --> 00:39:41.719
Lord, you have so blessed us abundantly.

00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:48.279
And sometimes we turn our eyes away

00:39:48.279 --> 00:39:49.919
from the needs of the world

00:39:51.239 --> 00:39:53.519
when really you want us to look deeply.

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.679
God, would you touch our hearts

00:39:57.679 --> 00:40:00.079
and would you help us to.

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:09.039
purpose this year to be more willing to sacrifice, more generous in our giving

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:15.199
for the needs of others? Would you help us to see that it's the example that you

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:22.159
set? God, I pray for those who are here that you would have them to lift up

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:28.439
their eyes and see the need. Maybe you're calling their life to be one of those

00:40:28.439 --> 00:40:35.239
that go. Whatever it is, I pray that you would burden us to see beyond ourselves,

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:42.359
to go beyond ourselves, to be willing to be used of you in a great way, giving,

00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:48.919
praying, going. I pray for that one here that may not know Christ as their Savior.

00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:57.239
I pray, Lord, that you would help them to see that even today, if they will confess

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:03.239
their need—indeed, we are sinners, we know it—and that the provision of the

00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:09.479
cross is there if they will call upon Jesus to be saved. For whosoever shall

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:16.479
call upon his name shall be saved. Lord, I pray you'd burden their heart. Now work

00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:21.599
in us, change us, and help us to see it, I pray. Just before I conclude my prayer, I

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:24.959
wonder if there'd be one or two that would say, you know, Preacher, God has

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:27.359
spoken to my heart.
