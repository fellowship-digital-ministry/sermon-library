1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,239
And if you look at the back of the bulletin, the title for the message this morning,

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:08,619
in Horeb, God made His greatness known.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:14,279
God had worked miraculously and rewarded the faith of the parents of Moses.

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,540
We read that in Exodus chapter number 2.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,700
It will not be the content of our message this morning,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,280
but we understand that there were some difficult times

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,500
in which were taking place there in Egypt,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,420
and the leadership of Pharaoh as a wicked man, and all that was taking place.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,380
And God blessed and rewarded the faith of the parents of Moses,

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,000
and Moses was spared death, and Moses had the opportunity to be raised

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,880
there in the home of Pharaoh in just an amazing set of circumstances.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,299
And then as you continue reading through the book of Exodus,

13
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,540
you'll find that through a series of events,

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,759
as we come to chapter number 3, he's ended up in Midian.

15
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,419
In fact, as you begin reading chapter number 3,

16
00:00:56,419 --> 00:01:00,880
you'll note that the Bible tells us that he was at the backside of the mountain,

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,879
and he came to the mountain of God, even Horeb, the backside of the desert, excuse me.

18
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,419
Notice what it says there in verse number 1,

19
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:13,000
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,580
and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,839
and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

22
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,959
Maybe sometimes you feel like, not physically,

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,300
but you feel like, emotionally, that you're on the backside of the desert.

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,459
You feel like it's a lonely place, a deserted place,

25
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,300
and you might feel like you're in that situation,

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,459
but we find, as we've used for the title this morning,

27
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,839
that in Horeb, God made his greatness known.

28
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:46,160
Before we dive into the passage of Scripture in Exodus chapter number 3,

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,879
I want you to jot down a couple of references, and I want to read the verses to you.

30
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not going to even turn there myself,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,300
but in Psalm 106 and verse number 8,

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,160
listen to what the psalmist says.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,959
The psalmist says this in Psalm 106 and verse number 8,

34
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,339
Nevertheless, he saved them for his namesake.

35
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:07,620
We must always recognize it's for God's namesake, it's for his glory,

36
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,880
but notice the last phrase of Psalm 106 and verse number 8.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,800
It says this, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,639
I'm so thankful that he is all-powerful,

39
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,800
and I'm so thankful that he works,

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
and he has recorded for us in the pages of Scripture

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,639
his wonderful works, his acts,

42
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,059
and through those we find that he's made his mighty power to be known.

43
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,520
Then I want you to listen to the words of Moses

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,339
as they're found in Deuteronomy chapter 3 and verse number 24.

45
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:49,059
We find that as we're beginning to look here in Exodus chapter number 3,

46
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:52,979
that this is the beginning of really our introduction to Moses

47
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,679
and to the ministry that God would call him to.

48
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,179
Of course, we read of him in chapter 2 specifically.

49
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,720
The first time we begin reading of him is birth and all that takes place,

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,179
but really the interaction with God

51
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:08,259
and the work that God would have for Moses,

52
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,679
we begin here in chapter number 3.

53
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:13,800
But I want you to think about Moses at the end of his life.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,300
In Deuteronomy chapter number 3, in verse number 24,

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,979
here's the testimony of Moses.

56
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,399
Listen to what he says.

57
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:26,639
Oh, Lord God, thou hast begun

58
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,360
to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,139
I want you to think about those words just for a moment.

60
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,479
I'll read the rest of the verse here in just a second,

61
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,100
but think about what he says.

62
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

63
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,860
Now, this is the same Moses that saw God do amazing things.

64
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,940
I mean, we read through the pages of Scripture

65
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,940
and the record of the life and ministry of Moses,

66
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,059
and we read of some amazing miracles of the power and might

67
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:05,600
and greatness of God on full display,

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
but Moses says, you've just begun to show me, I'm your servant,

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,779
you've just begun to show me thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

70
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,059
Why? Well, because God's greatness is unsearchable.

71
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,480
We know that the Lord is great.

72
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,519
It's our theme this year.

73
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,820
We've been preaching on the greatness of God

74
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,059
and how his greatness is revealed to us.

75
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,239
But I want you to understand that this morning,

76
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:31,980
I hope that you have a greater view of who God is today

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,440
than you did last week and that you did last month

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,200
and that we continue to see that he's greater than I even imagined.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,119
And as we go through life and we draw closer to God,

80
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,079
we see that he's greater and he's greater.

81
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,079
But the reality is that his greatness is unsearchable.

82
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,480
He continues and says,

83
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,359
for what God is there in heaven or in earth

84
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:59,660
that can do according to thy works and according to thy might?

85
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,160
The answer is none.

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,540
All the false gods of the lands and all of those false deities that exist,

87
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,839
we find that there's none like our God, Jehovah God, the God of the Bible.

88
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,839
And I'm so thankful that God has revealed himself to us.

89
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,220
And as we think about the life of Moses

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,459
and we think about this place as he's in Horeb,

91
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:27,420
that God made his greatness known there in that place,

92
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,700
even as it's described as the backside of the desert.

93
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,660
I mean, he had fled.

94
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,079
You think about the circumstances that led to Moses being in this place.

95
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,839
But we find that God made his greatness known.

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,220
If you're taking notes this morning, notice with me, first of all, the great scene.

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,179
In verses 1 through 14, we see this great scene that God gives us insight to.

98
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,720
It tells us in verse number two,

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,059
And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.

100
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
And he looked.

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,320
Verse three,

103
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,399
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, notice what he says,

104
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:15,980
and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,859
We find that this great scene begins with this burning bush.

106
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:23,279
And Moses sees this bush is burning with fire.

107
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:30,100
And as it draws his attention, he notices that the bush, however, is not consumed.

108
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,399
No doubt he had seen a bush burn at some point in his life,

109
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,559
and no doubt he'd experienced that.

110
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:40,660
But he'd never experienced seeing a bush burn, but not being consumed.

111
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,980
And he says, I'm going to go figure out what's going on.

112
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:51,279
Let me, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.

113
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,399
And this great scene that we see here begins in verse number four with a great encounter.

114
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,399
It's a great encounter. Notice the Bible tells us in verse number four,

115
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,079
And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,

116
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,779
God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses.

117
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,779
Now, can you imagine?

118
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,579
I mean, I understand that for many of us, we're familiar with this passage of scripture.

119
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,779
But this morning, I want you to think about Moses.

120
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,779
He's on the backside of the desert. He's in Horeb.

121
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,079
He's taking care of this flock, and he's there, and he sees this burning bush.

122
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,779
And he says, well, that's kind of strange. It's kind of odd.

123
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,279
That bush is not consumed. I can tell that it's burning with fire, and fire consumes things.

124
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,279
Amen? That's what it does.

125
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,079
He says, I'm going to turn aside. I'm going to see what's going on here.

126
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,079
And as he comes over, God sees that he comes, and God calls him, Moses, out of the bush.

127
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,079
Can you imagine?

128
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,079
I mean, this is a great encounter.

129
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,380
And we find that the Bible says that Moses says, here am I.

130
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Verse 5, and he said,

131
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,380
Draw not nigh hither.

132
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.

133
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,380
For the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

134
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,880
What made it holy? The presence of God.

135
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Not Moses, not the bush, not even the place.

136
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,179
It was that God was there.

137
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:19,179
And God's presence in this place, that's why I call it a great encounter,

138
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,679
because Moses has this encounter with God.

139
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:26,179
No doubt he had heard from his mom as he was growing up,

140
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:32,179
and before she had to turn him back over to the daughter of Pharaoh to continue to raise,

141
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,179
she had heard, no doubt, about God and about the people of God.

142
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,179
And we find now, however, that he has this encounter with God,

143
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,479
and he's told to take his shoes off because the place was holy ground.

144
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:47,479
Moreover, verse 6, he says,

145
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:51,479
Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father,

146
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,479
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

147
00:08:55,479 --> 00:09:01,479
And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

148
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,479
He recognized in the presence of God.

149
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,479
What an encounter.

150
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,479
What an encounter.

151
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,780
You know, I'm so thankful that we can enter into his presence.

152
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,780
The Bible says that in his presence is fullness of joy.

153
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,780
The Bible tells us that we're to come boldly into the throne of grace.

154
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,780
In fact, in that last verse of End Can It Be,

155
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,780
it sings about that boldly I approach the throne.

156
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,780
But it's not on our own merit that we can come boldly into the presence of God.

157
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,780
It's not because of any good thing in us.

158
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,780
No, it's because of the Lord Jesus Christ made a way.

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

160
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
And he said, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
And we find that he made a way.

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
He's our great high priest.

163
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

164
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
And when he was crucified,

165
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,080
that veil that separated the holy place from the holy of holies

166
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
granting access.

168
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
What a blessing.

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,560
And we find that Moses is here, what a great encounter.

170
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,960
But we find that the great encounter carries with it

171
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,080
as we continue to read, there's a great task.

172
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm gonna skip down to verse number 10.

173
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
We'll come back to verse number seven

174
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
here in just a moment.

175
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,200
But I want you to note with me, in this great scene,

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,160
we see this great encounter, but we see a great task.

177
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
Notice in verse number 10, the Bible says,

178
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,580
"'Come now therefore,' notice what God says to Moses,

179
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,340
"'and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,820
"'that thou mayest bring forth my people,

181
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,060
"'the children of Israel, out of Egypt.'"

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,020
This is a great task.

183
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,860
I mean, it's overwhelming as to the task

184
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,260
that God is assigning to Moses.

185
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,500
In fact, as we continue through the message this morning,

186
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,980
we'll see that there are some excuses

187
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,340
that are offered by Moses as to why

188
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
he cannot fulfill the task.

189
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,520
And as we think about this great task,

190
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,880
this great task that God has given to us this morning

191
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
that is mentioned to us in verse number 10,

192
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
I want us to be mindful of the fact

193
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,960
that God has given each of us a great task.

194
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,920
He's given us a task, not the task

195
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,560
that Moses had to bring his people out of Egypt,

196
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
but we find that he's given us the task

197
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,320
of taking the glorious gospel to a lost and dying world,

198
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,640
to a people that are dead in their sins

199
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,400
and in their trespasses, to a people that are bound

200
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
in their sin, a people that many times have no idea.

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,440
Many have not heard the name of Jesus

202
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,640
in the context of the scriptural understanding

203
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,880
of who Jesus is.

204
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
So often as you read the book of Acts,

205
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,720
you find that the comment will be made

206
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,000
specifically with Paul, how he would speak.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Peter says it as well, that he presents Jesus as the Christ.

208
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,720
And what is the significance of that?

209
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,520
Well, they knew the man Jesus,

210
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,120
the people that they're writing to,

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
the people that they're ministering to,

212
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
they were aware.

213
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,040
Remember, he says these things were not done in a corner.

214
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
You're aware of this, you've seen this,

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,880
you're witnesses of these things.

216
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,760
Speaking of the miracles of Jesus

217
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,880
and the life and ministry of Jesus,

218
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,160
but he says this Jesus, this man that you know,

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,880
he's the Christ, he's the God man,

220
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,640
he's the Messiah, he is God in flesh.

221
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,400
There's some people that know about Jesus in our society,

222
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,320
but they don't know the Jesus of the Bible.

223
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,240
What a great task that God has given us

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
to be his ambassadors, his representatives,

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,360
to take that glorious message, Jesus saves.

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
What a blessed truth.

227
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
We find that as we look here,

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
there's not only a great encounter and a great task,

229
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,920
but there's a great promise.

230
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
In verse number eight, notice what the Bible says.

231
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,800
It says this, and I am come down to deliver them,

232
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
his children, out of the hand of the Egyptians,

233
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
and to bring them up out of that land

234
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,400
unto a good land and a large

235
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
and unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

236
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,520
Who's gonna continue unto the place of the Canaanites

237
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,640
and the Hittites and the Amorites,

238
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,000
the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
But notice with me in verse number eight,

240
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,000
God had given, we read in verse number 10,

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,680
I kind of have gone in a different sequence

242
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,320
for purpose of getting to the point this morning,

243
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
but we find that God has commissioned,

244
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,760
has given this great task to Moses in verse number 10,

245
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,800
but who is it that's going to actually do the work?

246
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,600
It's God.

247
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,520
God says in verse number eight,

248
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
when we think about this great promise, he says,

249
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,800
I am come down to deliver them

250
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,560
out of the hand of the Egyptians.

251
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,480
It is God that is going to do the delivering.

252
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
And I think about this truth

253
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
as we make some parallels this morning

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,520
in our own lives and our own responsibilities to God,

255
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,040
that he's given us a great task,

256
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,120
but he's not told us to save anyone.

257
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,000
You know why?

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
We can't.

259
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
I can't save anyone.

260
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,840
You can't save anyone.

261
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
You know who does the saving?

262
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,160
Jesus Christ, the savior of the world.

263
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,480
Paul says, this is a faithful saying

264
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
and worthy of all acceptation

265
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,520
that Christ Jesus came into the world

266
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,240
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

267
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
When he says that it's a faithful saying,

268
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,960
it's a true saying.

269
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
This is the purpose.

270
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Jesus says himself, I am come to seek and to save

271
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,840
that which is lost.

272
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm so thankful that, listen,

273
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm thankful we don't have to do the saving.

274
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,320
God says some plant, some water,

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,360
but God gives the increase.

276
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
It was not Moses that was gonna deliver

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,640
the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,520
and from the Egyptians.

279
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,720
It was God that was going to do that,

280
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,040
but God was going to use a man.

281
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
Isn't that interesting?

282
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
Let me ask you this.

283
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,600
Could God have delivered the children of Israel

284
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
from Egypt without Moses?

285
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,720
I mean, he could have just caused an earthquake

286
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,000
to take place and consume all of those Egyptians

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,960
and then, man, the people are free to go,

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,240
but he chose to use a man.

289
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
That's very similar today.

290
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
God chooses to use us.

291
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,760
I don't fully understand why he would use us,

292
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,440
but honestly, it's amazing that he would use us.

293
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,960
They would give us and trust to us the gospel

294
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,160
and then tell us, go and tell them.

295
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,400
It's not your job to save them.

296
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,360
It's just your job to tell them.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,440
What a joy, what a blessing, what a privilege.

298
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,160
Not only we think about the great promise

299
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,080
that God says I am come to deliver them,

300
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,920
but notice with me in verse number 12.

301
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,440
Notice the second aspect of this great promise.

302
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,440
God says this, certainly I will be with thee.

303
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Aren't you so thankful for the presence of God?

304
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
God says to Moses,

305
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm gonna deliver the children of Israel.

306
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,000
By the way, I'm sending you to do it,

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,640
to be the man that I'm going to use,

308
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
and I'm gonna send you to Pharaoh,

309
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
but I want you to know that I'm gonna be with you.

310
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
Wow.

311
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
Reminds me of the promise of Matthew 28,

312
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,880
verses 18 and 20.

313
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,360
He said that we're to go into all the world

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,760
and preach the gospel, right?

315
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,000
And he tells us there in that passage of scripture,

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,920
I am with thee, I am with thee.

317
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,240
What a joy and what a blessing to know

318
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,960
that as we go to seek to fulfill this great task

319
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,480
that God has given us,

320
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,840
that we have this promise that it's God

321
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,040
that does the saving,

322
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
and it's God that's promised to be with us.

323
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm not alone.

324
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
I have God with me.

325
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
What a blessing.

326
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,600
But I want you to notice in this great scene,

327
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
and probably what makes it such a great scene

328
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,000
is our great God.

329
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,960
Our great God.

330
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,640
Notice with me how God reveals himself to Moses

331
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,360
in this portion of scripture.

332
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,440
The Bible tells us initially in verse number six

333
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
that he says to him,

334
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,840
I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,

335
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,680
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

336
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,200
And Moses hit his face for he was afraid to look upon God.

337
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,160
And as God continues to reveal himself to Moses,

338
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,440
notice what he says to him in verse number seven.

339
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,160
The Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction

340
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,560
of my people, which are in Egypt

341
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,440
and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters,

342
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,920
for I know their sorrows.

343
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,240
I want you to notice from verse number seven

344
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,520
that God is speaking to Moses in the past tense.

345
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,360
In other words, he's speaking to Moses

346
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,880
about what he knew took place.

347
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
And we find that God in making it known to Moses

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,560
in this fashion, I believe,

349
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,400
that God is revealing to Moses that he's eternal.

350
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
He's the God of the past, he's the God of the present,

351
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
and he's the God of the future.

352
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,320
He has no beginning and no ending.

353
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,640
I am alpha and omega is what God says.

354
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,600
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture

355
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
that God says to Moses,

356
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,280
I have surely seen the affliction of my people,

357
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,720
which are in Egypt.

358
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,880
I have heard their cry.

359
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,040
Listen, I'm thankful that God knows.

360
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm thankful that God knows.

361
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm thankful that he's eternal.

362
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,160
Notice as we continue reading, he says,

363
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,840
and I am come down to deliver them.

364
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
He's heard what took place in days and in time before,

365
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,559
but he says, I am come down now.

366
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,119
He's the God of the present.

367
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,480
And then he says, to deliver them, future tense.

368
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,799
God can speak authoritatively about the future

369
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,040
because God holds the future in his hand.

370
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
He knows all things.

371
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,640
See, God is outside of time.

372
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,799
We are bound by time.

373
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,559
Everything is time, time, time, time, time.

374
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm running out of time this morning.

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,960
I'm gonna borrow from Brother Lennon from last week.

376
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I was joking with some people about that.

377
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,040
Man, he got done.

378
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,119
I said, I'm not even on my second point by now.

379
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,760
What's going on, you know?

380
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,200
And don't get used to it, amen?

381
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:28,520
But your roast wasn't even done last week when you got home.

382
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,360
You know what I'm saying?

383
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,760
I mean, it was so early.

384
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,840
But look, he's the God of the past,

385
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,440
the present, and the future.

386
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,760
God's revealing this to Moses.

387
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,799
See, Moses is having this encounter with God.

388
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,840
And what makes it such a great scene

389
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,480
is that God is revealing himself to Moses.

390
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,880
I said, I've titled in Horeb, God Made His Greatness Known.

391
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,880
And God is revealing to Moses that he is the eternal God.

392
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,640
He is the God of the past, the present, and the future.

393
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,320
I want you to notice that he says.

394
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,320
In verse number 14, let me back up in verse number 12 as he says,

395
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I will certainly be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee,

396
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,320
when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

397
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Notice in verse number 13, Moses said unto God,

398
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them,

399
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me,

400
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
What is his name?

401
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
What shall I say unto them?

402
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Oh, verse 14, what a precious verse.

403
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
And God said unto Moses,

404
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I am that I am.

405
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I am that I am.

406
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,320
And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

407
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,320
I am hath sent me unto you.

408
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,320
This is, we'd often refer to as God's proper name, if you will, Jehovah.

409
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Jehovah. He's Jehovah God.

410
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,320
And he reveals himself to Moses,

411
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,320
I am that I am.

412
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Tell them, I am hath sent thee unto them, or sent me unto you.

413
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,320
We find that this word, this proper name of God, Jehovah, the great I am,

414
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
it carries with it the idea, helps us understand,

415
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
that he is the self-existent one.

416
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,320
He has no beginning and no end.

417
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
He's the self-existent one.

418
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,320
I'm mindful of what Jesus said,

419
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,320
as he's interacting with the religious leaders in John chapter number 8.

420
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,320
And as he's interacting with those religious leaders,

421
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
and they're questioning him and saying,

422
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,320
We don't know who you are, but we know who Abraham,

423
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
and we know who Moses, and we'd be the followers of them, and so on and so forth.

424
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,320
And Jesus is graciously interacting with them.

425
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
At the end of the text of the scripture, he says,

426
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Before Abraham was, I am.

427
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Wow. What a powerful declaration.

428
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Understanding that Jesus is God.

429
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
And we find here that in verse number 14,

430
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,320
this truth of our great God and how he's revealed himself to Moses,

431
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,320
and we see this great scene.

432
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,320
As we continue studying here through this portion of scripture,

433
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
I want you to see not only the first thought here of this great scene,

434
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,320
but number two, if you're taking notes, three great signs.

435
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Three great signs.

436
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Notice in verse number 15, God said moreover unto Moses,

437
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

438
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,

439
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you.

440
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,320
This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

441
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,

442
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,

443
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you,

444
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,320
and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.

445
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,320
And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt,

446
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,320
unto the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,

447
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,320
the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

448
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou shalt come,

449
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt.

450
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,320
And ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us.

451
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
And now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,

452
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.

453
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Notice verse 19.

454
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,320
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go.

455
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,320
No, not by a mighty hand.

456
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,320
God, again, knows the future. He knows what's going to happen.

457
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
There's a difficulty, I think, about Moses

458
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,320
and some of the excuses that he offers in the next several,

459
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
in chapter number four as we begin to continue looking here.

460
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
We find that God said, Pharaoh's not going to let you go.

461
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
No, not by a mighty hand.

462
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
But notice what he says, and I will stretch out my hand

463
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,320
and smite Egypt with all my wonders,

464
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
which I will do in the midst thereof.

465
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,320
And after that, he will let you go.

466
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,320
God begins to show his greatness to Moses here in Horeb.

467
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:20,320
We find in Egypt, he's going to continue to demonstrate his great power.

468
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
In verse 21, it says,

469
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,

470
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
and it shall come to pass that when you go, you shall not go empty,

471
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,320
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and her that sojourneth in her house

472
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and raiment.

473
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,320
You shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters,

474
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
and you shall spoil the Egyptians.

475
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Notice the excuses begin, and think about this truth of these three great signs.

476
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Beginning in verse number one of chapter four,

477
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
the Bible says that Moses answered and said,

478
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice.

479
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,320
For they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.

480
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Moses was concerned that the people would not believe him.

481
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
The people would not believe that God had appeared to him.

482
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,320
The people would not believe that God had given him this message.

483
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
And we find that Moses begins this objection,

484
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,320
and we find that the Lord answers him in verse number two

485
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
and gives us this first of three great signs.

486
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Notice what it says, the Lord said unto him,

487
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,320
What is that in thine hand?

488
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
And he said, A rod.

489
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
I want you to think about this.

490
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,320
God will use us for his glory if we surrender.

491
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Somebody said this years ago, preacher of yesteryear,

492
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,320
God's not looking for ability but for availability.

493
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:46,320
God will equip those who are willing to be used for his honor, for his glory.

494
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,320
His strength is made perfect in weakness.

495
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
You know, the best place for us to be as the people of God is to say,

496
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm just not able.

497
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Because then we're most dependent.

498
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Without me you can do nothing is what Jesus said.

499
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
The danger comes in the life of a believer when we think,

500
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I got this, I can handle this.

501
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
God says, you need me.

502
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,320
The songwriter said, I need thee every hour.

503
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
I've often made the comment about that song,

504
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,320
and I don't seek to criticize the songwriter,

505
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,320
but the reality is I need him every second of every minute of every hour.

506
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Without him we can do nothing.

507
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,320
We're but dust. We're frail.

508
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,320
But he is mighty.

509
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,320
And God says to Moses, what's in your hand?

510
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
He said, a rod.

511
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Notice what God does this first sign, the rod of Moses.

512
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
In verse number three it says that he said,

513
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,320
And he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent.

514
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
And Moses did exactly what I would do.

515
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
And Moses fled from before it.

516
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,320
He had some wisdom, didn't he?

517
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Can you imagine taking that rod and throwing it on the ground and it becomes a serpent?

518
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
I mean, this is his rod.

519
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Right?

520
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
This isn't a rod that he went and picked up somewhere.

521
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,320
God didn't say, go over there and pick up that rod and then it became a serpent.

522
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
He said, what's in your hand is his rod.

523
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,320
By the way, you know what a shepherd had?

524
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
He had a staff, a rod.

525
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
It's what they carried with them.

526
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,320
So this is what he had.

527
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,320
And God said, take that and throw it on the ground and he does.

528
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank God for his obedience.

529
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I mean, just immediately obeyed.

530
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
And then he flees from it.

531
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
And again, I'm with Moses.

532
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
And I have a hard time with verse number four.

533
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm just honest with you.

534
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,320
The Bible says that the Lord said unto Moses, put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.

535
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Lord, you want me to do what?

536
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm just being transparent with you.

537
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
I would have had a really, really hard time with this.

538
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
I hate snakes.

539
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Terrible.

540
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,320
He says, go and take it by the tail.

541
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Again, what does Moses do?

542
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,320
The Bible says he put forth his hand and caught it.

543
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,320
And it became a rod in his hand.

544
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I know that we're familiar with this.

545
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Can you imagine?

546
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
I mean, God's making his greatness known.

547
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,320
He says to Moses, take that rod that's in your hand and throw it down.

548
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
And now it becomes a serpent.

549
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
And you pick it up again and it becomes a rod.

550
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
God's making his greatness known.

551
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,320
God says this in verse number five, that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers,

552
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,320
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

553
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
And then the Lord says this, furthermore unto him, put now thine hand into thy bosom.

554
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
This is the second of these great signs.

555
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
He says, put now thy hand into thy bosom.

556
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
And he put his hand into his bosom.

557
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Now again, Moses is obedient immediately.

558
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
God says, put your hand in.

559
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,320
And the Bible says that when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

560
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
You know what your hand looks like.

561
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
He put it in, it was fine.

562
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Brings it out and it's leprous as snow.

563
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Wow.

564
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Verse seven, he said, put thine hand into thy bosom again.

565
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,320
He put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom.

566
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,320
And behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

567
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Isn't that amazing?

568
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
It's amazing.

569
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,320
God's given him these three great signs.

570
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
The rod, his hand.

571
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Leprous, puts it in again, brings it out and it's whole.

572
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,760
number 8, the Bible says, and it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither

573
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,520
hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter

574
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
sign.

575
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,640
And then he gives them a future sign, then we look at these two that God gave him immediately

576
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,840
here in this objection when he said, the people aren't going to believe me or hearken unto

577
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
me.

578
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,480
And God gives them the sign of the rod and of his hand.

579
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,000
And then in verse number 9, he tells them this, and it shall come to pass if they will

580
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,880
not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take

581
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,600
of the water of the river.

582
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,560
So now he's talking about the water at the Nile when he'd go to Egypt, and he tells them

583
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,320
that you take the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land, and the water which

584
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,000
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

585
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,680
Wow.

586
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,000
We know the plagues, the water turned to blood, and we see that God's giving this third sign

587
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,520
that we see here.

588
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,240
And the Bible says that Moses, even after hearing these things, he said unto the Lord

589
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,160
in verse number 10, O my Lord, I am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken

590
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,240
unto thy servant, but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.

591
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:22,200
The Lord said unto him, what a great question, who hath made man's mouth?

592
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,920
Who hath made man's mouth?

593
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
What's the answer?

594
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
God.

595
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,540
He's the creator.

596
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,720
Or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind?

597
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,800
Have not I the Lord?

598
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,960
And he says, now therefore, go.

599
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,160
Now therefore, go, and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.

600
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:50,400
Moses, as he continues to have some struggles here, we find that there's these signs that

601
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,920
have been given, the rod in his hand, and then God promises them that if they don't

602
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,600
believe you for those things, you take some of that water from the river there, the Nile,

603
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,200
and you pour it out, and it will become blood on the land.

604
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,320
We find that though in the midst of some struggles, we find that Moses goes.

605
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,040
Notice in verse number 18, the Bible says that Moses went and returned to Jethro, his

606
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,160
father-in-law, and said unto him, let me go.

607
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,040
I pray thee and return unto my brethren, which are in Egypt, and see whether they be

608
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
yet alive.

609
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,840
And Jethro said unto Moses, go in peace.

610
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,440
That was the first step for Moses.

611
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,560
Before he would ever stand before Pharaoh and say, let my people go, he had to stand

612
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,240
before his father-in-law and say, let me go.

613
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,600
He stood before his father-in-law, Jethro, and he said, let me go.

614
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,520
He told him where he was going to go and why he was going to go, and we see that Moses

615
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,080
is given the answer from Jethro, go in peace.

616
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,000
I want you to notice at the end of verse number 20, the Bible tells us that Moses took the

617
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,680
rod of God in his hand.

618
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,920
God had given him that instruction in verse number 17.

619
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,640
He said, and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

620
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,200
Take the rod.

621
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,960
I love how verse number 20 refers to it as the rod of God in his hand.

622
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,560
We find that Moses, and we'll skip down just a few verses for sake of time, we find that

623
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,560
as you come to verse number 28, the Bible says that Moses told Aaron all the words of

624
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,360
the Lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him.

625
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,280
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel,

626
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,800
and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

627
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,600
Notice it says, and did the signs in the sight of the people, and the people believed.

628
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,360
Isn't that a precious four-word statement?

629
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,000
People believed.

630
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,240
Those signs that God gave, these three signs that we're speaking of, they were impactful

631
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
in the lives of the people.

632
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
They believed.

633
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,680
And notice it says, and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel

634
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:10,560
and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

635
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,960
What a great response to what they had understood.

636
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,839
Now for those of you that are familiar with the portion of the book of Exodus that we're

637
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,559
looking at here, you understand that things did not immediately just turn good and man,

638
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,200
they just were released and they went.

639
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,420
No, they faced some real difficulty.

640
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,960
In fact, Moses gives the testimony that since I've come to Pharaoh that you've not delivered

641
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
this people.

642
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,279
In fact, it's just become worse for the people.

643
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,160
There's a responsibility to obey.

644
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,040
See God began here in Horeb.

645
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,399
Moses made the statement at the end of his life, O Lord God, thou hast begun to show

646
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,160
thy servant thy greatness in thy mighty hand.

647
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,520
And we've got to think about Moses and his life and all the way back here in this first

648
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,279
encounter that he has with God in Horeb.

649
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:04,140
And how God in Horeb made his greatness known to his servant.

650
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,720
There's a burning bush, this encounter that God reveals to us where this great scene and

651
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,520
this burning bush and it's burning with fire but it's not consumed and through that series

652
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,160
of events as we've looked at, God makes himself known to Moses and he gives a task but he

653
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,279
promises to be with him.

654
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,160
God gives him these signs.

655
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,399
God begins to reveal his greatness to Moses.

656
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:39,320
Moses goes on as we would look at his life and its totality.

657
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,800
We see that Moses, many of us would say is a great hero of the faith.

658
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,960
Begin to think about Moses and you talk about people that have Bible characters that become

659
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,800
favorites and if there was one Bible character to be your favorite, for some Moses would

660
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,600
be on their list.

661
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:07,660
But it all started in Horeb when God made his greatness known.

662
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,080
This morning, God wants to make his greatness known to you.

663
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,839
He wants to reveal to you who he is through the pages of this book.

664
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:20,160
He wants you to know who he is.

665
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,399
He wants you to know that he is the great God, he is Jehovah God, the self-existent

666
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,000
one, the God of the past, the present and the future.

667
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,960
He wants you to know that he is the savior of the world.

668
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,240
He wants you to know that he's giving you a task and you begin to think about all of

669
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,920
these things and how God reveals his greatness to us and what's our response to that?

670
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,399
Our response to God revealing his greatness ought to be obedience.

671
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:48,940
We understand that Moses, just as we could relate to, he's got some difficulties there

672
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,440
but God, they're not going to listen but God, I'm not eloquent and so on and so forth and

673
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,800
certainly there are times in which we too offer excuses to God but at the end of the

674
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,320
day Moses was obedient.

675
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,800
Moses went to Jethro and said, let me go.

676
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,140
And Jethro says, go in peace.

677
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,200
And then Moses goes and he meets Aaron and they meet with the elders and they call the

678
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,399
people and they tell him.

679
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,960
Praise the Lord.

680
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:25,200
But what caused him to go was that God revealed his greatness to him in Horeb.

681
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,399
Because of this encounter with God that we read of in this portion of Scripture in Exodus

682
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:36,500
chapter number 3, it changed the course of Moses' life.

683
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,920
No longer would Moses be on the backside of the desert but Moses would now and over the

684
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,760
next several, I mean, pages of Scripture.

685
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Who is it that we look to over and over and over as the human leader that God would use?

686
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Moses.

687
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Moses.

688
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,720
Wow.

689
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:09,279
God revealed his greatness and Moses responded in obedience.

690
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:13,600
I thought of this as we were singing that song this morning, And Can It Be, I mentioned

691
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,240
this a little bit even yesterday during our men's prayer breakfast, you know, when we

692
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:27,839
truly understand all that our God has done for us, all that he is to us, our response

693
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,119
ought to be one of obedience.

694
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,160
And can it be?

695
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,119
Amazing love, how can it be?

696
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,440
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me.

697
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,679
But what's my response to that?

698
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:54,039
When he's revealed to me his greatness that I live for him, that I live for him in obedience.

699
00:38:54,039 --> 00:39:02,600
And we read in the life of Moses over chapters and chapters of God's Word all that God would

700
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,880
use him to do and how God would continue to reveal his greatness to him, but it started

701
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,679
in Horeb when God made his greatness known.

702
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:18,239
This morning, I hope you see God in all of his glory, hope you see God for who he is.

703
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:25,440
He's a great God, greatly to be praised, and he is deserving of my everything.

704
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,280
What's in your hand, God, you can have it, you can have it.

705
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,239
God just wants us to surrender to him.

706
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,359
If you've never been saved, if you've not trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

707
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,799
Savior, let me say as Paul said, today is the day of salvation.

708
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,239
Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.

709
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,119
We talked about the task that he's given to us as his people, those that have already

710
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,600
been saved.

711
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,200
We sang the first song, are you washed in the blood?

712
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,000
What does it mean to be washed in the blood?

713
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
It means to be saved.

714
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,320
I can't save myself, not by works of righteousness, which we have done.

715
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,120
According to His mercy He hath begotten us, for by grace we are saved through faith, and

716
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,200
that not of works is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast."

717
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

718
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,440
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

719
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:26,640
This morning, if you can say, I've been washed in the blood, and I hope you can, then let's

720
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,640
live for Jesus.

721
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,280
Be willing to do whatever He's called us to do.

722
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,040
Lord, I'm yours, because you've showed me your greatness.

723
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,680
If you've not been washed in the blood, you do not have 100% confidence.

724
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,600
If you deny today that heaven is your home, you say, Pastor, I'm trying to do the best

725
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,880
I can.

726
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,480
I have people tell me that all the time.

727
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,400
In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, I had somebody say, I'm doing good.

728
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,160
I said, what happens if your good isn't good enough?

729
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
He said, well, I'll do better.

730
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
That's what he said to me.

731
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,920
I said, what happens if better isn't good enough?

732
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,880
He said, well, I'll do whatever is better than better.

733
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,880
That's what he said.

734
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,840
I said, the reality is this.

735
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,160
We're not redeemed with corruptible things, but with the precious blood of Christ.

736
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,320
The only payment for your sin and for my sin is the blood of Christ, and it's sufficient.

737
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,960
It satisfies the demands of a holy God.

738
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,240
If you've not been saved today, today is the day of salvation.

739
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,720
If you've been saved, let's live for Jesus.

740
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,880
Let's see Him in His greatness, as Moses did, and say, Lord, I'll go.

741
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,240
I don't know how I'm going to do it, but you promised to be with me, and you actually promised

742
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,040
to do the work, and God, just use me.

743
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,060
I'm just yielded and surrendered.

744
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Let's pray together.

745
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,400
Father, we love you.

746
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,120
We thank you for loving us.

747
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,600
We thank you for your precious word.

748
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
We thank you for the life of Moses.

749
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:06,880
As we think about his life, we thank you, God, for this event, this encounter that is

750
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:14,560
recorded in Exodus chapter number 3, the record of where you in Horeb made your greatness

751
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,080
known to your servant.

752
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,300
God, we're thankful that you're a great God.

753
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,600
We thank you that you do all things well.

754
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,480
God, if there's one present this morning, one that's tuned in via live stream that's

755
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,240
never been saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal savior,

756
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,920
they do not have 100% confidence that heaven is their home, oh, God, I pray that you'd

757
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,240
move and work in their hearts and lives this morning.

758
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,320
I pray, God, that you would convict them of their own sin, of Christ's righteousness and

759
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,720
of judgment to come.

760
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,000
God, I pray for every believer that's here this morning.

761
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,880
I pray, Lord, that you would stir us up.

762
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,200
Lord, that we'd see you in all of your greatness.

763
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,320
Like Moses, we would be surrendered and yielded, that we'd go.

764
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,120
Lord, that we'd be willing.

765
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,640
I pray that you'd use us, God, for your glory.

766
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
Would you move and work in these few moments of invitation?

767
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,860
Have your way, Lord, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

768
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,720
Would you stand with me as our custom is at the end of our service, we have an opportunity

769
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
for you to respond.

770
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,840
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

771
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,400
for sure that heaven is your home.

772
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,280
Maybe the Lord just spoke to your heart in some particular way this morning through his

773
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,640
word and you just want to come and pray and ask God to help you.

774
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,480
There's a specific need, something specific that God dealt with.

775
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
As Kate plays, the altar is open.
