00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.239
And if you look at the back of the bulletin, the title for the message this morning,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:08.619
in Horeb, God made His greatness known.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:14.279
God had worked miraculously and rewarded the faith of the parents of Moses.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.540
We read that in Exodus chapter number 2.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.700
It will not be the content of our message this morning,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.280
but we understand that there were some difficult times

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.500
in which were taking place there in Egypt,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.420
and the leadership of Pharaoh as a wicked man, and all that was taking place.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.380
And God blessed and rewarded the faith of the parents of Moses,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.000
and Moses was spared death, and Moses had the opportunity to be raised

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880
there in the home of Pharaoh in just an amazing set of circumstances.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.299
And then as you continue reading through the book of Exodus,

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.540
you'll find that through a series of events,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.759
as we come to chapter number 3, he's ended up in Midian.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.419
In fact, as you begin reading chapter number 3,

00:00:56.419 --> 00:01:00.880
you'll note that the Bible tells us that he was at the backside of the mountain,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.879
and he came to the mountain of God, even Horeb, the backside of the desert, excuse me.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:07.419
Notice what it says there in verse number 1,

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:13.000
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.580
and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.839
and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:23.959
Maybe sometimes you feel like, not physically,

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:28.300
but you feel like, emotionally, that you're on the backside of the desert.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.459
You feel like it's a lonely place, a deserted place,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.300
and you might feel like you're in that situation,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.459
but we find, as we've used for the title this morning,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.839
that in Horeb, God made his greatness known.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:46.160
Before we dive into the passage of Scripture in Exodus chapter number 3,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.879
I want you to jot down a couple of references, and I want to read the verses to you.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm not going to even turn there myself,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.300
but in Psalm 106 and verse number 8,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.160
listen to what the psalmist says.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.959
The psalmist says this in Psalm 106 and verse number 8,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.339
Nevertheless, he saved them for his namesake.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:07.620
We must always recognize it's for God's namesake, it's for his glory,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.880
but notice the last phrase of Psalm 106 and verse number 8.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.800
It says this, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.639
I'm so thankful that he is all-powerful,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.800
and I'm so thankful that he works,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800
and he has recorded for us in the pages of Scripture

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.639
his wonderful works, his acts,

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:38.059
and through those we find that he's made his mighty power to be known.

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.520
Then I want you to listen to the words of Moses

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.339
as they're found in Deuteronomy chapter 3 and verse number 24.

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.059
We find that as we're beginning to look here in Exodus chapter number 3,

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.979
that this is the beginning of really our introduction to Moses

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.679
and to the ministry that God would call him to.

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.179
Of course, we read of him in chapter 2 specifically.

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.720
The first time we begin reading of him is birth and all that takes place,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.179
but really the interaction with God

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.259
and the work that God would have for Moses,

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.679
we begin here in chapter number 3.

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.800
But I want you to think about Moses at the end of his life.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.300
In Deuteronomy chapter number 3, in verse number 24,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.979
here's the testimony of Moses.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.399
Listen to what he says.

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:26.639
Oh, Lord God, thou hast begun

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.360
to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.139
I want you to think about those words just for a moment.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.479
I'll read the rest of the verse here in just a second,

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.100
but think about what he says.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.100
Thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.860
Now, this is the same Moses that saw God do amazing things.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.940
I mean, we read through the pages of Scripture

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.940
and the record of the life and ministry of Moses,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.059
and we read of some amazing miracles of the power and might

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.600
and greatness of God on full display,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600
but Moses says, you've just begun to show me, I'm your servant,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.779
you've just begun to show me thy greatness and thy mighty hand.

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.059
Why? Well, because God's greatness is unsearchable.

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:19.480
We know that the Lord is great.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.519
It's our theme this year.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.820
We've been preaching on the greatness of God

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.059
and how his greatness is revealed to us.

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.239
But I want you to understand that this morning,

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:31.980
I hope that you have a greater view of who God is today

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.440
than you did last week and that you did last month

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.200
and that we continue to see that he's greater than I even imagined.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.119
And as we go through life and we draw closer to God,

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:43.079
we see that he's greater and he's greater.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:47.079
But the reality is that his greatness is unsearchable.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.480
He continues and says,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.359
for what God is there in heaven or in earth

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:59.660
that can do according to thy works and according to thy might?

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.160
The answer is none.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.540
All the false gods of the lands and all of those false deities that exist,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.839
we find that there's none like our God, Jehovah God, the God of the Bible.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.839
And I'm so thankful that God has revealed himself to us.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.220
And as we think about the life of Moses

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.459
and we think about this place as he's in Horeb,

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:27.420
that God made his greatness known there in that place,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.700
even as it's described as the backside of the desert.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.660
I mean, he had fled.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.079
You think about the circumstances that led to Moses being in this place.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:38.839
But we find that God made his greatness known.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.220
If you're taking notes this morning, notice with me, first of all, the great scene.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.179
In verses 1 through 14, we see this great scene that God gives us insight to.

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:49.720
It tells us in verse number two,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.059
And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.100
And he looked.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.100
Behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.320
Verse three,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.399
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, notice what he says,

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:15.980
and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.859
We find that this great scene begins with this burning bush.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.279
And Moses sees this bush is burning with fire.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:30.100
And as it draws his attention, he notices that the bush, however, is not consumed.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.399
No doubt he had seen a bush burn at some point in his life,

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.559
and no doubt he'd experienced that.

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:40.660
But he'd never experienced seeing a bush burn, but not being consumed.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.980
And he says, I'm going to go figure out what's going on.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:51.279
Let me, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:57.399
And this great scene that we see here begins in verse number four with a great encounter.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.399
It's a great encounter. Notice the Bible tells us in verse number four,

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.079
And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:07.779
God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses.

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:09.779
Now, can you imagine?

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:13.579
I mean, I understand that for many of us, we're familiar with this passage of scripture.

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.779
But this morning, I want you to think about Moses.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.779
He's on the backside of the desert. He's in Horeb.

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:22.079
He's taking care of this flock, and he's there, and he sees this burning bush.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:24.779
And he says, well, that's kind of strange. It's kind of odd.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:30.279
That bush is not consumed. I can tell that it's burning with fire, and fire consumes things.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.279
Amen? That's what it does.

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:35.079
He says, I'm going to turn aside. I'm going to see what's going on here.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:41.079
And as he comes over, God sees that he comes, and God calls him, Moses, out of the bush.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:43.079
Can you imagine?

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:45.079
I mean, this is a great encounter.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.380
And we find that the Bible says that Moses says, here am I.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.380
Verse 5, and he said,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.380
Draw not nigh hither.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.380
Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.380
For the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.880
What made it holy? The presence of God.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.880
Not Moses, not the bush, not even the place.

00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:15.179
It was that God was there.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:19.179
And God's presence in this place, that's why I call it a great encounter,

00:08:19.179 --> 00:08:22.679
because Moses has this encounter with God.

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:26.179
No doubt he had heard from his mom as he was growing up,

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:32.179
and before she had to turn him back over to the daughter of Pharaoh to continue to raise,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.179
she had heard, no doubt, about God and about the people of God.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:40.179
And we find now, however, that he has this encounter with God,

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:44.479
and he's told to take his shoes off because the place was holy ground.

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:47.479
Moreover, verse 6, he says,

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:51.479
Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father,

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.479
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

00:08:55.479 --> 00:09:01.479
And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.479
He recognized in the presence of God.

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:05.479
What an encounter.

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:07.479
What an encounter.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.780
You know, I'm so thankful that we can enter into his presence.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.780
The Bible says that in his presence is fullness of joy.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.780
The Bible tells us that we're to come boldly into the throne of grace.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.780
In fact, in that last verse of End Can It Be,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.780
it sings about that boldly I approach the throne.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.780
But it's not on our own merit that we can come boldly into the presence of God.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.780
It's not because of any good thing in us.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.780
No, it's because of the Lord Jesus Christ made a way.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.080
And he said, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.080
And we find that he made a way.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.080
He's our great high priest.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.080
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.080
And when he was crucified,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.080
that veil that separated the holy place from the holy of holies

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.080
was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.080
granting access.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.080
What a blessing.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.560
And we find that Moses is here, what a great encounter.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.960
But we find that the great encounter carries with it

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.080
as we continue to read, there's a great task.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.520
I'm gonna skip down to verse number 10.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.040
We'll come back to verse number seven

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.080
here in just a moment.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.200
But I want you to note with me, in this great scene,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.160
we see this great encounter, but we see a great task.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.240
Notice in verse number 10, the Bible says,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.580
"'Come now therefore,' notice what God says to Moses,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.340
"'and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.820
"'that thou mayest bring forth my people,

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.060
"'the children of Israel, out of Egypt.'"

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.020
This is a great task.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.860
I mean, it's overwhelming as to the task

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.260
that God is assigning to Moses.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.500
In fact, as we continue through the message this morning,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.980
we'll see that there are some excuses

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.340
that are offered by Moses as to why

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.340
he cannot fulfill the task.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.520
And as we think about this great task,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.880
this great task that God has given to us this morning

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720
that is mentioned to us in verse number 10,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.400
I want us to be mindful of the fact

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.960
that God has given each of us a great task.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.920
He's given us a task, not the task

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.560
that Moses had to bring his people out of Egypt,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.560
but we find that he's given us the task

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.320
of taking the glorious gospel to a lost and dying world,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.640
to a people that are dead in their sins

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.400
and in their trespasses, to a people that are bound

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.440
in their sin, a people that many times have no idea.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.440
Many have not heard the name of Jesus

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.640
in the context of the scriptural understanding

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.880
of who Jesus is.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.560
So often as you read the book of Acts,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.720
you find that the comment will be made

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.000
specifically with Paul, how he would speak.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Peter says it as well, that he presents Jesus as the Christ.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.720
And what is the significance of that?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.520
Well, they knew the man Jesus,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.120
the people that they're writing to,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.040
the people that they're ministering to,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.120
they were aware.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.040
Remember, he says these things were not done in a corner.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.000
You're aware of this, you've seen this,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.880
you're witnesses of these things.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.760
Speaking of the miracles of Jesus

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.880
and the life and ministry of Jesus,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.160
but he says this Jesus, this man that you know,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.880
he's the Christ, he's the God man,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.640
he's the Messiah, he is God in flesh.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.400
There's some people that know about Jesus in our society,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.320
but they don't know the Jesus of the Bible.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.240
What a great task that God has given us

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.000
to be his ambassadors, his representatives,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.360
to take that glorious message, Jesus saves.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.160
What a blessed truth.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.000
We find that as we look here,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.480
there's not only a great encounter and a great task,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.920
but there's a great promise.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.320
In verse number eight, notice what the Bible says.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.800
It says this, and I am come down to deliver them,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.240
his children, out of the hand of the Egyptians,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.640
and to bring them up out of that land

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.400
unto a good land and a large

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.800
and unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.520
Who's gonna continue unto the place of the Canaanites

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.640
and the Hittites and the Amorites,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.000
the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.400
But notice with me in verse number eight,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.000
God had given, we read in verse number 10,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.680
I kind of have gone in a different sequence

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.320
for purpose of getting to the point this morning,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.720
but we find that God has commissioned,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.760
has given this great task to Moses in verse number 10,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.800
but who is it that's going to actually do the work?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.600
It's God.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.520
God says in verse number eight,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320
when we think about this great promise, he says,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.800
I am come down to deliver them

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.560
out of the hand of the Egyptians.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.480
It is God that is going to do the delivering.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.080
And I think about this truth

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.080
as we make some parallels this morning

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.520
in our own lives and our own responsibilities to God,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.040
that he's given us a great task,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.120
but he's not told us to save anyone.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.000
You know why?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.440
We can't.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.120
I can't save anyone.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.840
You can't save anyone.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.440
You know who does the saving?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.160
Jesus Christ, the savior of the world.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.480
Paul says, this is a faithful saying

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.960
and worthy of all acceptation

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.520
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.240
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.320
When he says that it's a faithful saying,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.960
it's a true saying.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.120
This is the purpose.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.120
Jesus says himself, I am come to seek and to save

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.840
that which is lost.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.120
I'm so thankful that, listen,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.320
I'm thankful we don't have to do the saving.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.320
God says some plant, some water,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.360
but God gives the increase.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.440
It was not Moses that was gonna deliver

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.640
the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.520
and from the Egyptians.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.720
It was God that was going to do that,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.040
but God was going to use a man.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.520
Isn't that interesting?

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.240
Let me ask you this.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.600
Could God have delivered the children of Israel

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.360
from Egypt without Moses?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.720
I mean, he could have just caused an earthquake

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.000
to take place and consume all of those Egyptians

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.960
and then, man, the people are free to go,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.240
but he chose to use a man.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320
That's very similar today.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.080
God chooses to use us.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.760
I don't fully understand why he would use us,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.440
but honestly, it's amazing that he would use us.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.960
They would give us and trust to us the gospel

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
and then tell us, go and tell them.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.400
It's not your job to save them.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.360
It's just your job to tell them.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.440
What a joy, what a blessing, what a privilege.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.160
Not only we think about the great promise

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.080
that God says I am come to deliver them,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.920
but notice with me in verse number 12.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.440
Notice the second aspect of this great promise.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.440
God says this, certainly I will be with thee.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.400
Aren't you so thankful for the presence of God?

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.080
God says to Moses,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.800
I'm gonna deliver the children of Israel.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.000
By the way, I'm sending you to do it,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.640
to be the man that I'm going to use,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.600
and I'm gonna send you to Pharaoh,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.680
but I want you to know that I'm gonna be with you.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.760
Wow.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.680
Reminds me of the promise of Matthew 28,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.880
verses 18 and 20.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.360
He said that we're to go into all the world

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.760
and preach the gospel, right?

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.000
And he tells us there in that passage of scripture,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.920
I am with thee, I am with thee.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.240
What a joy and what a blessing to know

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.960
that as we go to seek to fulfill this great task

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.480
that God has given us,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.840
that we have this promise that it's God

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.040
that does the saving,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.040
and it's God that's promised to be with us.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.720
I'm not alone.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.160
I have God with me.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.640
What a blessing.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.600
But I want you to notice in this great scene,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.800
and probably what makes it such a great scene

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.000
is our great God.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.960
Our great God.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.640
Notice with me how God reveals himself to Moses

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.360
in this portion of scripture.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.440
The Bible tells us initially in verse number six

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.560
that he says to him,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.840
I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.680
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.200
And Moses hit his face for he was afraid to look upon God.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.160
And as God continues to reveal himself to Moses,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.440
notice what he says to him in verse number seven.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.160
The Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.560
of my people, which are in Egypt

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.440
and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.920
for I know their sorrows.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.240
I want you to notice from verse number seven

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.520
that God is speaking to Moses in the past tense.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.360
In other words, he's speaking to Moses

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.880
about what he knew took place.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.960
And we find that God in making it known to Moses

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.560
in this fashion, I believe,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.400
that God is revealing to Moses that he's eternal.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.440
He's the God of the past, he's the God of the present,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.240
and he's the God of the future.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.320
He has no beginning and no ending.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.640
I am alpha and omega is what God says.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.600
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.360
that God says to Moses,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.280
I have surely seen the affliction of my people,

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.720
which are in Egypt.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.880
I have heard their cry.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.040
Listen, I'm thankful that God knows.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.200
I'm thankful that God knows.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.280
I'm thankful that he's eternal.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.160
Notice as we continue reading, he says,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.840
and I am come down to deliver them.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.440
He's heard what took place in days and in time before,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.559
but he says, I am come down now.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.119
He's the God of the present.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.480
And then he says, to deliver them, future tense.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.799
God can speak authoritatively about the future

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:58.040
because God holds the future in his hand.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.040
He knows all things.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.640
See, God is outside of time.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.799
We are bound by time.

00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:08.559
Everything is time, time, time, time, time.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.880
I'm running out of time this morning.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.960
I'm gonna borrow from Brother Lennon from last week.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200
I was joking with some people about that.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.040
Man, he got done.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.119
I said, I'm not even on my second point by now.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.760
What's going on, you know?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.200
And don't get used to it, amen?

00:19:25.239 --> 00:19:28.520
But your roast wasn't even done last week when you got home.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.360
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.760
I mean, it was so early.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.840
But look, he's the God of the past,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.440
the present, and the future.

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:39.760
God's revealing this to Moses.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.799
See, Moses is having this encounter with God.

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:44.840
And what makes it such a great scene

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.480
is that God is revealing himself to Moses.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.880
I said, I've titled in Horeb, God Made His Greatness Known.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.880
And God is revealing to Moses that he is the eternal God.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.640
He is the God of the past, the present, and the future.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.320
I want you to notice that he says.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.320
In verse number 14, let me back up in verse number 12 as he says,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.320
I will certainly be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.320
when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.320
Notice in verse number 13, Moses said unto God,

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.320
Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.320
The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320
What is his name?

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320
What shall I say unto them?

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.320
Oh, verse 14, what a precious verse.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.320
And God said unto Moses,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.320
I am that I am.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.320
I am that I am.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.320
And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.320
I am hath sent me unto you.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:00.320
This is, we'd often refer to as God's proper name, if you will, Jehovah.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.320
Jehovah. He's Jehovah God.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.320
And he reveals himself to Moses,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.320
I am that I am.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.320
Tell them, I am hath sent thee unto them, or sent me unto you.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:22.320
We find that this word, this proper name of God, Jehovah, the great I am,

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320
it carries with it the idea, helps us understand,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.320
that he is the self-existent one.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.320
He has no beginning and no end.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.320
He's the self-existent one.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.320
I'm mindful of what Jesus said,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.320
as he's interacting with the religious leaders in John chapter number 8.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.320
And as he's interacting with those religious leaders,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.320
and they're questioning him and saying,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.320
We don't know who you are, but we know who Abraham,

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.320
and we know who Moses, and we'd be the followers of them, and so on and so forth.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.320
And Jesus is graciously interacting with them.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.320
At the end of the text of the scripture, he says,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Before Abraham was, I am.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.320
Wow. What a powerful declaration.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.320
Understanding that Jesus is God.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.320
And we find here that in verse number 14,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.320
this truth of our great God and how he's revealed himself to Moses,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.320
and we see this great scene.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.320
As we continue studying here through this portion of scripture,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.320
I want you to see not only the first thought here of this great scene,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.320
but number two, if you're taking notes, three great signs.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.320
Three great signs.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.320
Notice in verse number 15, God said moreover unto Moses,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.320
The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.320
and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.320
This is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.320
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.320
The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.320
appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you,

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.320
and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.320
And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.320
unto the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.320
the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.320
And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou shalt come,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.320
thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.320
And ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.320
And now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.320
that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.320
Notice verse 19.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.320
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.320
No, not by a mighty hand.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.320
God, again, knows the future. He knows what's going to happen.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.320
There's a difficulty, I think, about Moses

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.320
and some of the excuses that he offers in the next several,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.320
in chapter number four as we begin to continue looking here.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.320
We find that God said, Pharaoh's not going to let you go.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.320
No, not by a mighty hand.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.320
But notice what he says, and I will stretch out my hand

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.320
and smite Egypt with all my wonders,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.320
which I will do in the midst thereof.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.320
And after that, he will let you go.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.320
God begins to show his greatness to Moses here in Horeb.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:20.320
We find in Egypt, he's going to continue to demonstrate his great power.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320
In verse 21, it says,

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.320
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.320
and it shall come to pass that when you go, you shall not go empty,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.320
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and her that sojourneth in her house

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.320
jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and raiment.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.320
You shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.320
and you shall spoil the Egyptians.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.320
Notice the excuses begin, and think about this truth of these three great signs.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.320
Beginning in verse number one of chapter four,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
the Bible says that Moses answered and said,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.320
But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.320
For they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.320
Moses was concerned that the people would not believe him.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.320
The people would not believe that God had appeared to him.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.320
The people would not believe that God had given him this message.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.320
And we find that Moses begins this objection,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.320
and we find that the Lord answers him in verse number two

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.320
and gives us this first of three great signs.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.320
Notice what it says, the Lord said unto him,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.320
What is that in thine hand?

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.320
And he said, A rod.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.320
I want you to think about this.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.320
God will use us for his glory if we surrender.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.320
Somebody said this years ago, preacher of yesteryear,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.320
God's not looking for ability but for availability.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:46.320
God will equip those who are willing to be used for his honor, for his glory.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.320
His strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.320
You know, the best place for us to be as the people of God is to say,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.320
I'm just not able.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.320
Because then we're most dependent.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.320
Without me you can do nothing is what Jesus said.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.320
The danger comes in the life of a believer when we think,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.320
I got this, I can handle this.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.320
God says, you need me.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.320
The songwriter said, I need thee every hour.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.320
I've often made the comment about that song,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.320
and I don't seek to criticize the songwriter,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.320
but the reality is I need him every second of every minute of every hour.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.320
Without him we can do nothing.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.320
We're but dust. We're frail.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.320
But he is mighty.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.320
And God says to Moses, what's in your hand?

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.320
He said, a rod.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.320
Notice what God does this first sign, the rod of Moses.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.320
In verse number three it says that he said,

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.320
And he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.320
And Moses did exactly what I would do.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.320
And Moses fled from before it.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.320
He had some wisdom, didn't he?

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.320
Can you imagine taking that rod and throwing it on the ground and it becomes a serpent?

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.320
I mean, this is his rod.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.320
Right?

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.320
This isn't a rod that he went and picked up somewhere.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.320
God didn't say, go over there and pick up that rod and then it became a serpent.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.320
He said, what's in your hand is his rod.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.320
By the way, you know what a shepherd had?

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.320
He had a staff, a rod.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.320
It's what they carried with them.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.320
So this is what he had.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.320
And God said, take that and throw it on the ground and he does.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.320
Thank God for his obedience.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.320
I mean, just immediately obeyed.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.320
And then he flees from it.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.320
And again, I'm with Moses.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320
And I have a hard time with verse number four.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.320
I'm just honest with you.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:53.320
The Bible says that the Lord said unto Moses, put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.320
Lord, you want me to do what?

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.320
I'm just being transparent with you.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.320
I would have had a really, really hard time with this.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320
I hate snakes.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.320
Terrible.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.320
He says, go and take it by the tail.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.320
Again, what does Moses do?

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.320
The Bible says he put forth his hand and caught it.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320
And it became a rod in his hand.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.320
I know that we're familiar with this.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.320
Can you imagine?

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320
I mean, God's making his greatness known.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.320
He says to Moses, take that rod that's in your hand and throw it down.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.320
And now it becomes a serpent.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.320
And you pick it up again and it becomes a rod.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.320
God's making his greatness known.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.320
God says this in verse number five, that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers,

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.320
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.320
And then the Lord says this, furthermore unto him, put now thine hand into thy bosom.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.320
This is the second of these great signs.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.320
He says, put now thy hand into thy bosom.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.320
And he put his hand into his bosom.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320
Now again, Moses is obedient immediately.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.320
God says, put your hand in.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.320
And the Bible says that when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.320
You know what your hand looks like.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.320
He put it in, it was fine.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.320
Brings it out and it's leprous as snow.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.320
Wow.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.320
Verse seven, he said, put thine hand into thy bosom again.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.320
He put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.320
And behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.320
Isn't that amazing?

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.320
It's amazing.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.320
God's given him these three great signs.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.320
The rod, his hand.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:01.320
Leprous, puts it in again, brings it out and it's whole.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.760
number 8, the Bible says, and it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.520
hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520
sign.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.640
And then he gives them a future sign, then we look at these two that God gave him immediately

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.840
here in this objection when he said, the people aren't going to believe me or hearken unto

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840
me.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.480
And God gives them the sign of the rod and of his hand.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.000
And then in verse number 9, he tells them this, and it shall come to pass if they will

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.880
not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.600
of the water of the river.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.560
So now he's talking about the water at the Nile when he'd go to Egypt, and he tells them

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.320
that you take the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land, and the water which

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.000
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.680
Wow.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:57.000
We know the plagues, the water turned to blood, and we see that God's giving this third sign

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.520
that we see here.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.240
And the Bible says that Moses, even after hearing these things, he said unto the Lord

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:09.160
in verse number 10, O my Lord, I am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.240
unto thy servant, but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:22.200
The Lord said unto him, what a great question, who hath made man's mouth?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.920
Who hath made man's mouth?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920
What's the answer?

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920
God.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.540
He's the creator.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.720
Or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind?

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.800
Have not I the Lord?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.960
And he says, now therefore, go.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.160
Now therefore, go, and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:50.400
Moses, as he continues to have some struggles here, we find that there's these signs that

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.920
have been given, the rod in his hand, and then God promises them that if they don't

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.600
believe you for those things, you take some of that water from the river there, the Nile,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.200
and you pour it out, and it will become blood on the land.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:10.320
We find that though in the midst of some struggles, we find that Moses goes.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.040
Notice in verse number 18, the Bible says that Moses went and returned to Jethro, his

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.160
father-in-law, and said unto him, let me go.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.040
I pray thee and return unto my brethren, which are in Egypt, and see whether they be

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.040
yet alive.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.840
And Jethro said unto Moses, go in peace.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.440
That was the first step for Moses.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.560
Before he would ever stand before Pharaoh and say, let my people go, he had to stand

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.240
before his father-in-law and say, let me go.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.600
He stood before his father-in-law, Jethro, and he said, let me go.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.520
He told him where he was going to go and why he was going to go, and we see that Moses

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.080
is given the answer from Jethro, go in peace.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.000
I want you to notice at the end of verse number 20, the Bible tells us that Moses took the

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.680
rod of God in his hand.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.920
God had given him that instruction in verse number 17.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.640
He said, and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.200
Take the rod.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.960
I love how verse number 20 refers to it as the rod of God in his hand.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:24.560
We find that Moses, and we'll skip down just a few verses for sake of time, we find that

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.560
as you come to verse number 28, the Bible says that Moses told Aaron all the words of

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.360
the Lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.280
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel,

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.800
and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:47.600
Notice it says, and did the signs in the sight of the people, and the people believed.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.360
Isn't that a precious four-word statement?

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.000
People believed.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.240
Those signs that God gave, these three signs that we're speaking of, they were impactful

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.840
in the lives of the people.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
They believed.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.680
And notice it says, and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:10.560
and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.960
What a great response to what they had understood.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.839
Now for those of you that are familiar with the portion of the book of Exodus that we're

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:23.559
looking at here, you understand that things did not immediately just turn good and man,

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:25.200
they just were released and they went.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.420
No, they faced some real difficulty.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.960
In fact, Moses gives the testimony that since I've come to Pharaoh that you've not delivered

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960
this people.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.279
In fact, it's just become worse for the people.

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:40.160
There's a responsibility to obey.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.040
See God began here in Horeb.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.399
Moses made the statement at the end of his life, O Lord God, thou hast begun to show

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:50.160
thy servant thy greatness in thy mighty hand.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.520
And we've got to think about Moses and his life and all the way back here in this first

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.279
encounter that he has with God in Horeb.

00:34:58.279 --> 00:35:04.140
And how God in Horeb made his greatness known to his servant.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:09.720
There's a burning bush, this encounter that God reveals to us where this great scene and

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.520
this burning bush and it's burning with fire but it's not consumed and through that series

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:21.160
of events as we've looked at, God makes himself known to Moses and he gives a task but he

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:26.279
promises to be with him.

00:35:26.279 --> 00:35:29.160
God gives him these signs.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.399
God begins to reveal his greatness to Moses.

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:39.320
Moses goes on as we would look at his life and its totality.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.800
We see that Moses, many of us would say is a great hero of the faith.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.960
Begin to think about Moses and you talk about people that have Bible characters that become

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.800
favorites and if there was one Bible character to be your favorite, for some Moses would

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.600
be on their list.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:07.660
But it all started in Horeb when God made his greatness known.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.080
This morning, God wants to make his greatness known to you.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.839
He wants to reveal to you who he is through the pages of this book.

00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:20.160
He wants you to know who he is.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.399
He wants you to know that he is the great God, he is Jehovah God, the self-existent

00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.000
one, the God of the past, the present and the future.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.960
He wants you to know that he is the savior of the world.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.240
He wants you to know that he's giving you a task and you begin to think about all of

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.920
these things and how God reveals his greatness to us and what's our response to that?

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:44.399
Our response to God revealing his greatness ought to be obedience.

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:48.940
We understand that Moses, just as we could relate to, he's got some difficulties there

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.440
but God, they're not going to listen but God, I'm not eloquent and so on and so forth and

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.800
certainly there are times in which we too offer excuses to God but at the end of the

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.320
day Moses was obedient.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.800
Moses went to Jethro and said, let me go.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.140
And Jethro says, go in peace.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.200
And then Moses goes and he meets Aaron and they meet with the elders and they call the

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.399
people and they tell him.

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.960
Praise the Lord.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:25.200
But what caused him to go was that God revealed his greatness to him in Horeb.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.399
Because of this encounter with God that we read of in this portion of Scripture in Exodus

00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:36.500
chapter number 3, it changed the course of Moses' life.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:42.920
No longer would Moses be on the backside of the desert but Moses would now and over the

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.760
next several, I mean, pages of Scripture.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:55.760
Who is it that we look to over and over and over as the human leader that God would use?

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.760
Moses.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.760
Moses.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.720
Wow.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:09.279
God revealed his greatness and Moses responded in obedience.

00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:13.600
I thought of this as we were singing that song this morning, And Can It Be, I mentioned

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.240
this a little bit even yesterday during our men's prayer breakfast, you know, when we

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:27.839
truly understand all that our God has done for us, all that he is to us, our response

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:31.119
ought to be one of obedience.

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:34.160
And can it be?

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.119
Amazing love, how can it be?

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:44.440
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.679
But what's my response to that?

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:54.039
When he's revealed to me his greatness that I live for him, that I live for him in obedience.

00:38:54.039 --> 00:39:02.600
And we read in the life of Moses over chapters and chapters of God's Word all that God would

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.880
use him to do and how God would continue to reveal his greatness to him, but it started

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.679
in Horeb when God made his greatness known.

00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:18.239
This morning, I hope you see God in all of his glory, hope you see God for who he is.

00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:25.440
He's a great God, greatly to be praised, and he is deserving of my everything.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.280
What's in your hand, God, you can have it, you can have it.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.239
God just wants us to surrender to him.

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:38.359
If you've never been saved, if you've not trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:43.799
Savior, let me say as Paul said, today is the day of salvation.

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:46.239
Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:50.119
We talked about the task that he's given to us as his people, those that have already

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.600
been saved.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.200
We sang the first song, are you washed in the blood?

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.000
What does it mean to be washed in the blood?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.760
It means to be saved.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.320
I can't save myself, not by works of righteousness, which we have done.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.120
According to His mercy He hath begotten us, for by grace we are saved through faith, and

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:12.200
that not of works is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast."

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.160
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.440
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:26.640
This morning, if you can say, I've been washed in the blood, and I hope you can, then let's

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.640
live for Jesus.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.280
Be willing to do whatever He's called us to do.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:38.040
Lord, I'm yours, because you've showed me your greatness.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.680
If you've not been washed in the blood, you do not have 100% confidence.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.600
If you deny today that heaven is your home, you say, Pastor, I'm trying to do the best

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.880
I can.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.480
I have people tell me that all the time.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.400
In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, I had somebody say, I'm doing good.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.160
I said, what happens if your good isn't good enough?

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160
He said, well, I'll do better.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680
That's what he said to me.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.920
I said, what happens if better isn't good enough?

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.880
He said, well, I'll do whatever is better than better.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.880
That's what he said.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.840
I said, the reality is this.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:17.160
We're not redeemed with corruptible things, but with the precious blood of Christ.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.320
The only payment for your sin and for my sin is the blood of Christ, and it's sufficient.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.960
It satisfies the demands of a holy God.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.240
If you've not been saved today, today is the day of salvation.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.720
If you've been saved, let's live for Jesus.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.880
Let's see Him in His greatness, as Moses did, and say, Lord, I'll go.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.240
I don't know how I'm going to do it, but you promised to be with me, and you actually promised

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.040
to do the work, and God, just use me.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.060
I'm just yielded and surrendered.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.060
Let's pray together.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.400
Father, we love you.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.120
We thank you for loving us.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.600
We thank you for your precious word.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240
We thank you for the life of Moses.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:06.880
As we think about his life, we thank you, God, for this event, this encounter that is

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:14.560
recorded in Exodus chapter number 3, the record of where you in Horeb made your greatness

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.080
known to your servant.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.300
God, we're thankful that you're a great God.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.600
We thank you that you do all things well.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.480
God, if there's one present this morning, one that's tuned in via live stream that's

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.240
never been saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal savior,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.920
they do not have 100% confidence that heaven is their home, oh, God, I pray that you'd

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.240
move and work in their hearts and lives this morning.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.320
I pray, God, that you would convict them of their own sin, of Christ's righteousness and

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.720
of judgment to come.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.000
God, I pray for every believer that's here this morning.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.880
I pray, Lord, that you would stir us up.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.200
Lord, that we'd see you in all of your greatness.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.320
Like Moses, we would be surrendered and yielded, that we'd go.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.120
Lord, that we'd be willing.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.640
I pray that you'd use us, God, for your glory.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.000
Would you move and work in these few moments of invitation?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.860
Have your way, Lord, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.720
Would you stand with me as our custom is at the end of our service, we have an opportunity

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720
for you to respond.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.840
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.400
for sure that heaven is your home.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.280
Maybe the Lord just spoke to your heart in some particular way this morning through his

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.640
word and you just want to come and pray and ask God to help you.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.480
There's a specific need, something specific that God dealt with.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.240
As Kate plays, the altar is open.
