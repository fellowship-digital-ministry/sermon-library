1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
number 21, John chapter number 21 this evening, and we'll use this passage of Scripture as

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,760
a springboard into our message this evening.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,840
I said 21, sorry, John chapter number 20, John chapter number 20, and look with me,

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:26,159
if you will, at verses 28 and 29, John chapter number 20 and verses 28 and 29, and the context

5
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,260
in which we're dealing with in this particular portion of Scripture is after the resurrection

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,000
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and He, of course, made Himself known, He appeared to many, and

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,560
the Bible tells us in verse number 19 of John chapter number 20 that the same day evening,

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,959
being the first day of the week when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled

9
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,840
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them, Peace be

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,119
unto you.

11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,159
We find that Thomas was not there, according to verse number 24, the Bible says, but Thomas,

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,880
one of the 12, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,959
And they told them, they told Thomas about seeing the Lord, and he said that he would

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,760
not believe, and so on and so forth, but you find that in verse number 26, it says, and

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,959
after eight days again, His disciples were within, and Thomas with them, then came Jesus,

16
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,019
the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you.

17
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:28,000
Then saith He to Thomas, Reach thither thy finger, and behold My hands, and reach hither

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,959
thy hand, and thrust it into My side, and be not faithless, but believing.

19
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,639
The text that I wanted to use this evening is our springboard here in verses 28 and 29.

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,260
Notice what Thomas says in verse number 28, and Thomas answered and said unto Him, My

21
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,400
Lord and my God.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,239
Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

24
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:04,680
Last week, we examined Matthew chapter number 16, and we looked at that question that Jesus

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,460
asked the disciples, Whom do men say that I am?

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,880
And of course, we looked at that passage of Scripture, and I mentioned this last week,

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,839
that the question that was asked by Jesus to the disciples is just as important today

28
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,080
as it's ever been.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,839
The confusion of the people that we find in Matthew chapter number 16, remember the disciples

30
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:30,720
say, well, some think that you're John the Baptist, or Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or one of

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
the prophets, and there was confusion amongst the people with regard to who Jesus is, who

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,779
He was, and we find that that confusion still exists today.

33
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:45,179
We understand that Paul said to the believers there in Corinth in 2 Corinthians chapter

34
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:50,259
number 4 that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, and we

35
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:56,259
have the responsibility of preaching the gospel and giving the gospel, and we understand that

36
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:03,639
we must know who Christ is, but we must be able to speak to those that we come into contact

37
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,820
with with regard to who is Jesus.

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,500
We understood that though there was confusion amongst the people, that Peter answered with

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,139
great confidence, and he proclaimed, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

40
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,100
And what a powerful declaration that we see by Peter in that text of Scripture.

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,619
And I think about this as I see Thomas' response in verse number 28, when Thomas says, my Lord

42
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,660
and my God.

43
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,300
And when we understand who Jesus is, when we study the doctrine of Christ as we've entered

44
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,899
into as of last Wednesday evening, and we think about the person of Christ and who He

45
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:46,179
is, God in flesh, if I were to title the message this evening, and I'm sure it's going to be

46
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:53,820
a two-part message, I would simply entitle it this, Jesus is all the world to me.

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,740
And there's a song with that title, Jesus is all the world to me, and the songwriter

48
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,860
said this, Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all.

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,179
He is my strength from day to day, without Him I would fall.

50
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:14,779
When I am sad, to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so.

51
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,179
When I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my friend.

52
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:22,179
Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trial sore.

53
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:27,380
I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er.

54
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,179
He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest, golden grain.

55
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:35,339
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, He's my friend.

56
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,179
Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be.

57
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:44,619
Oh, how could I this friend deny, when He's so true to me.

58
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:48,739
Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night.

59
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,820
Following Him by day and night, He's my friend.

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,339
Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend.

61
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,540
I trust Him now, I trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end.

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,660
Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end.

63
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,100
Eternal life, eternal joy, He's my friend.

64
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,260
And I would echo what the songwriter said in that song that I just read.

65
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,940
Jesus is all the world to me, I'm so thankful.

66
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,579
The word of God reveals to us who Jesus is, and

67
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,820
that we have been privileged as believers to be in a place where

68
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,220
someone at some point brought the gospel to us.

69
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,140
Whether you're the first believer in your family or

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,660
whether your parents were introduced to the gospel or your grandparents or

71
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,179
however far you dig down, someone brought the gospel to your family.

72
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:49,019
And you have the privilege of knowing through this precious book who Jesus is.

73
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,260
And what a blessing because there are countless numbers of people around

74
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,140
the globe that are blinded with regard to the question, who is Jesus, who is He?

75
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,739
Not only are those that are blinded, but we find that in a world where there are

76
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:09,059
over 7 billion people, a percentage of them have never

77
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:14,220
even heard the name of Jesus, yet even hearing the gospel.

78
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,140
And how privileged we are, and we find that Thomas is my Lord and my God.

79
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,820
Jesus says, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.

80
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,700
And then think of this, the latter part of verse number 29.

81
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,420
Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,339
I've not seen him, but I believe the record that he has given us, and

83
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,739
I am so thankful for the word of God.

84
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:39,059
Why is it that Jesus is all the world to me?

85
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:42,220
Well, I'm sure there's plenty of answers that we could give to that question, but

86
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,459
I've tried to categorize it into five particular areas this evening.

87
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,899
And I know that I won't get through all of them, so

88
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,339
this will be a multi-part series, but let's look at this.

89
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,940
Number one, why is Jesus all the world to me?

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,179
Because of who he is, because of who he is.

91
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:01,500
He's God, he's God in the flesh.

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,140
We think about this, look over in John chapter number one, and

93
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,660
we'll be all over the scriptures this evening.

94
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,420
And looking at a number of portions, and seeing what the word of God tells us.

95
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,899
Notice in John chapter number one, a very familiar portion of scripture.

96
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,500
In verse number one, the Bible says, in the beginning was the word, and

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,179
the word was with God, and the word was God.

98
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,260
The same was in the beginning with God.

99
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,619
All things were made by him, and

100
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:29,019
without him was not anything made that was made.

101
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:31,059
You notice in verse number 14, the Bible says, and

102
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:35,540
the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

103
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,980
And we beheld his glory.

104
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,299
The glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

105
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:46,179
Look at the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number two.

106
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,019
Philippians chapter number two, and

107
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,980
look at verses five through 11 of this portion of scripture.

108
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,859
Philippians chapter number two, beginning in verse number five.

109
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:01,540
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,

110
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,299
who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but

111
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:09,579
made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,

112
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,619
was made in the likeness of men.

113
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:15,179
Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and

114
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,260
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

115
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,100
Wherefore, God also hath highly exalted him, and

116
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,940
given him a name which is above every name.

117
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,140
The name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven, and

118
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,179
things in earth, and things under the earth.

119
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,020
And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,

120
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,299
to the glory of God the Father.

121
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,020
In the book of Hebrews, and of course,

122
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,580
we studied through the book of Hebrews this calendar year.

123
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,940
But we find that in Hebrews chapter number two,

124
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,940
that the Bible tells us how that the Lord Jesus Christ,

125
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,260
he came in the seed of Abraham.

126
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,859
It says in verse number 16 of Hebrews 2, for

127
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,940
verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,460
he took on him the seed of Abraham.

129
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,739
And so we begin to understand this evening who he is.

130
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:08,900
We understand the answer that Peter gave to that question that was asked last week.

131
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Whom do men say that I am?

132
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,780
And we find that there were some that said John the Baptist, and

133
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,460
others that were given as answers.

134
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,979
And Peter says, thou art the Christ, after Jesus then says, but

135
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,539
whom say ye that I am?

136
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,140
Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

137
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,979
And we find the word of God teaches us we could read about, study the incarnation,

138
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:30,460
and understanding even the portions of scripture that we've just read.

139
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,659
But when we consider who he is, we must consider his humanity.

140
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,460
The humanity, he took upon himself the form of a man.

141
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,580
He came in the likeness of men, put upon himself the form of a servant,

142
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,219
came in the likeness of men.

143
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:46,020
And so we think about his humanity, we could ask this question,

144
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,500
how do we know what evidence do we have with regard to the humanity of Christ?

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,859
In Matthew chapter number four, in verse number two,

146
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,260
the Bible tells us that he was hungry.

147
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,020
We find that, of course, it was after the

148
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,840
the time of fasting and the Bible says and when he had fasted 40 days and 40

149
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,360
nights he was afterward and hungered the Bible tells us in the book of John in

150
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
the fourth chapter you remember the situation where he said that he must

151
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,200
needs go through Samaria and he meets the woman at the well and in John

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,840
chapter 4 verses 6 & 7 the Bible tells us that he was thirsty we find that

153
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Jesus in Mark chapter number 4 he's in the ship and the Bible says that he was

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,700
asleep in the in the hinder part the the back part of the ship why he was

155
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,380
tired and so we see those revelations to us in the Gospels with regard to the

156
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,740
humanity of Christ that he was a man and he had to come in the likeness of men so

157
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,620
that he could die in our place so that he could provide the sacrifice that

158
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,100
would be acceptable for our redemption so we see his humanity but we also see

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,200
his deity and just as we'd say that he was tired remember when he woke up as

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,160
they came and they were the disciples were just concerned and I see them kind

161
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,000
of rushing in and saying master carest thou not that we perish what does he do

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,880
he goes out and he rebukes the wind and the waves and says peace be still and

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,600
there's a calm and he demonstrates his power we think about the truth if you

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,860
would turn to the book of Mark chapter number two and notice with me I don't

165
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,240
have time to read the entirety of the portion of Scripture but in this passage

166
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,600
of Scripture we find that Jesus in thinking about considering not only his

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,360
humanity but his deity that he is God that he forgave sin we referenced this

168
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,560
portion briefly a few weeks ago but you'll understand that Jesus was there

169
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,480
and he told this man that thy sins be forgiven in verse number five this was

170
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,980
the man that his friends were concerned about his condition he was one that was

171
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,140
sick of the palsy and they brought him in through the roof because there were

172
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,100
so many people they couldn't get in and Jesus saw them and saw this man and said

173
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,100
thy sins be forgiven thee and those that were sitting around those religious

174
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,780
leaders the scribes in particular in verse number seven they say this who can

175
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,300
forgive sins but God only who can forgive sins but God only you know I

176
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
can't forgive you of your sins you can't forgive me of my sin but God is

177
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,400
the one that forgives we find that throughout the Old Testament we find the

178
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,100
reference that our God is ready to pardon ready to forgive with thee there

179
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,400
is forgiveness and what a blessing to understand that we find in first John

180
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,780
chapter number one that if we confess our sins that he is faithful and just to

181
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,740
forgive right to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and what a blessing to

182
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,940
understand they say who can forgive sins but God only and so Jesus says at the

183
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,120
end of verse number eight why reason you these things in your hearts and then

184
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,260
as he's there talking in verse number ten he says that you may know that the

185
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,480
Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins he sayeth to the sick of

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
the palsy I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine

187
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,000
house and immediately in verse number twelve that man arose took up his bed

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and went forth the Bible says that they were all amazed and glorified God saying

189
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,540
we never saw it on this fashion and so he forgave sins why because he's God we

190
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,340
see his deity we see that he raised the dead of course we could look at a few

191
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,180
examples in the Gospels my mind races to the one that's probably the most

192
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,620
familiar to us in John the the Gospel of John in chapter 3 11 you remember that

193
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,340
Lazarus was sick and we look at the passage of Scripture we find that he

194
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,920
Jesus was made aware of the sickness of Lazarus and he comes and they were

195
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,000
saying things such as this if you would been here if you would have been here my

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,600
brother wouldn't have died they believed that Jesus was able to heal Lazarus of

197
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,920
his sickness why well there were many that were healed throughout the life and

198
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,520
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ the disciples had witnessed those things and

199
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,220
Jesus here did not go he tarried his departure there was a delay in his

200
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,140
leaving why for the glory of God for the work for the fact that he says to the

201
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,580
disciples early in the passage that they would would be just encouraged that they

202
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,580
would grow in their faith he says that he was glad for their sakes that they

203
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,740
were that he was not there to the intent that you may believe and not only did

204
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,280
Mary and Martha understand that if Jesus had been there he could have

205
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,340
healed Lazarus but there were some that were gathered there that were Jews that

206
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,840
were lamenting the death of Lazarus and after Jesus wept these Jews say it's

207
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,360
recorded in verse number 37 they say amongst themselves could not this man

208
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,540
which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not

209
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:06,280
have died the miracle that had taken place back in John chapter number nine

210
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,580
with regard to the healing of the man that was born blind was fresh on the

211
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,240
minds of these Jewish people and they say after Jesus wept they said well if

212
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,120
he had been here I mean he healed the man that was born blind certainly he had

213
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,320
the power to have healed this man so that he did not die but Jesus purposed

214
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,220
and he did not go to heal him why because he was gonna raise him from the

215
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,340
dead he'd been dead for four days you remember the response the pushback if

216
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,340
you will that was received when he said that they should move the stone and you

217
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,640
find that he says take away the stone in verse number 39 and there's just a level

218
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,860
of objection if you will for Martha when she says by this time he stinketh he had

219
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,620
been dead four days but Jesus will proclaim in verse number 43 with a loud

220
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,800
voice Lazarus come forth the Bible tells us that he that was dead came forth

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,160
bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a

222
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,080
napkin Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go Wow what an amazing truth

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,120
of the Word of God we find that there were many that responded in believing

224
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,220
because of what they had seen and we think about this why is Jesus all the

225
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,740
world to me because of who he is he's God we see his humanity throughout the

226
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,040
Gospels we see his deity that he is God in flesh notice with me not only because

227
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,580
of who he is but because of his mighty power think about the power of Christ we

228
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,920
understand as we read the Word of God and we've mentioned about the attributes

229
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,000
of God that our God is omnipotent that he has all power the Lord God omnipotent

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,560
reigneth and what a blessing to read through the Word of God and to see the

231
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,420
power of God demonstrated and of course it's declared for us many times we see

232
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,460
during the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ of his great power his

233
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,020
mighty power I'll list a number of things we see number one his power over

234
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,460
demons look in the book of Luke if you will and chapter number eight and I'll

235
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,260
give you the entire portion of which you could go back and read I won't have time

236
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,620
to read the entirety of these portions of Scripture but in Luke chapter number

237
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,000
eight in verses 26 through 39 you'll read about the account in which Jesus

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
had crossed over the lake and they'd gone over the sea there and they went to

239
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,120
the country of the Gadarenes and as they're there they meet this man that is

240
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,400
possessed with a demon and the Bible tells us in verse number 27 that he had

241
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,040
devils a long time and wear no clothes neither a boat in any house but in the

242
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,900
tombs and Jesus will ask him in verse number 30 what is thy name and he said

243
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,040
legion because many devils were entered into him we find that Jesus demonstrated

244
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,480
his power over the demons in fact the demons they know who Jesus is James says

245
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,240
that the devils believe in tremble in verse number 28 we say that we see that

246
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
it says when he saw Jesus he cried out fell down before him and with a loud

247
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,600
voice said what have I to do with the Jesus thou son of God most high I

248
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,260
beseech thee torment me not and Jesus will rebuke these demons and heal this

249
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,180
man and of course we find that he's then clothed in his right mind sitting at the

250
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,420
feet of Jesus being instructed the people that were there in the city they

251
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,380
besought him to depart from them they wanted him to leave because of all that

252
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,300
had taken place and this man was begging the Lord to be able to go with him it

253
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,059
says in verse number 38 that he besought him that he might be with him

254
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,559
but Jesus sent him and said that he was to be a testimony in his own community

255
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,000
there and to show them how great things God hath done unto thee and the Bible

256
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,080
tells us that he went his way and published throughout the whole city how

257
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,160
great things Jesus had done unto him and so when we think about the mighty power

258
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,140
of God we see the power of Christ over demons over disease we've mentioned

259
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,720
already some reference with regard to the way in which our God is able to heal

260
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,619
we mentioned John chapter 9 with the man that was born blind you think about

261
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:19,600
John chapter number 5 I've often looked at John chapter number 5 and in

262
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,920
reference that portion of Scripture is when the impotent man meets the

263
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,160
omnipotent God and that man was lame and Jesus asks him a question in John

264
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,040
chapter number 5 and it's a he'd been there for 38 years he had this

265
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,840
infirmity for 38 years and Jesus says in verse number 6 wilt thou be made whole

266
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,400
now we understand that if you had an infirmity for that period of time and

267
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040
someone came and asked you if you wanted to be made whole you would answer

268
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,400
absolutely notice in verse number 7 it says the impotent man answered him sir I

269
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,040
have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am

270
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,000
coming another step at that

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,519
down before me, Jesus saith unto him,

272
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,679
rise, take up thy bed, and walk."

273
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,060
Can you imagine?

274
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,640
38 years, impotent.

275
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,119
He's there at the pool of Siloam,

276
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,100
the Bible talks about in the first several verses,

277
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,239
again, we don't have time to look at all of it,

278
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,360
but we find that he had desired to be healed

279
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,959
and yet had no hope or no expectation,

280
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,280
and Jesus comes and says,

281
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,719
will thou be made whole?

282
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,600
And he says, I have no one to let me in,

283
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,799
and Jesus says, rise, take up thy bed, and walk,

284
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,880
and immediately the man was made whole

285
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,040
and took up his bed and walked.

286
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,680
On the same day was the Sabbath,

287
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,520
of course he received some just negative response

288
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,880
from the Jews because of that,

289
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,799
but this is a miraculous demonstration

290
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,319
of God's power over disease.

291
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,080
I think about the woman with the issue of blood.

292
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,279
She spent all of her living with going to the physicians

293
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,680
and trying to find some way to be healed

294
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,400
of this problem that she had,

295
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,400
and she spent all of her substance and yet was no better.

296
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,879
She said this, and she knew that Jesus was coming that way,

297
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:17,160
she said, if I could just touch the hem of his garment,

298
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,680
and the people were thronging him

299
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,800
and all the things that are going on,

300
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,319
and she touches the hem of his garment,

301
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,419
and of course Jesus says, who touched me?

302
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:26,900
The disciples kind of look around,

303
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,459
and what do you mean who touched you?

304
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,459
And he knew that virtue had been departed,

305
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:34,620
and she came and he said, thy faith hath made thee whole,

306
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,379
and she was immediately healed.

307
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,339
The power of our God, the power of Christ

308
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,620
demonstrated over demons, over disease, over death.

309
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,220
We mentioned it already in John chapter 11,

310
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,220
and you see his ability to raise them from the dead.

311
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:54,739
We find that he, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ,

312
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:57,660
he conquered sin, death, and the grave,

313
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,379
and we understand this thing of death.

314
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:04,940
In fact, I believe that even as we've gone through 2020,

315
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,419
I know that I've mentioned a number of times

316
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:09,339
that there are a number of people in our world

317
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:12,259
that are more aware of their mortality

318
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,539
than perhaps had been the case prior

319
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:17,259
to what we've been dealing with here in 2020.

320
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,639
In fact, it's given some very unique opportunities

321
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,839
of witness for a number of years.

322
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,320
I was at the pastor's conference yesterday,

323
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
and for a number of years,

324
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,520
and I was talking to some people

325
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,300
about the fact that we've always said,

326
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,460
hey, if you were to die today,

327
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,279
are you 100% sure that you'd go to heaven?

328
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,160
We understand the certainty of death,

329
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,919
but what a joy to know the reality,

330
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,639
the certainty of heaven,

331
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,940
and as was pointed out, man wants to die,

332
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,559
but we find that Jesus,

333
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,960
not only did he raise people from the dead,

334
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,440
but we understand that he conquered sin,

335
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,320
death, and the grave,

336
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
and someone said this,

337
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,559
when we think about death for a believer,

338
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,679
it's simply a doorway to enter,

339
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,279
to leave this life and enter that life,

340
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,240
and what a blessing to think about the reality of heaven

341
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,279
and being with our Savior for all of eternity.

342
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,039
Over nature, number four, over nature,

343
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
because of his mighty power,

344
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,759
in Mark chapter number four,

345
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,960
turn over and look at that passage, if you will, with me,

346
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,880
and this is just a powerful passage of scripture.

347
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,119
I referenced it a moment ago

348
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,039
when I spoke about the fact that he was asleep

349
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,119
on a pillow in the ship,

350
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,839
but notice with me in verse number 35,

351
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,679
the Bible says,

352
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,000
the same day when the evening was come,

353
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,119
he saith unto them,

354
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,220
let us pass over unto the other side,

355
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
and when they had sent away the multitude,

356
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
they took him even as he was in the ship,

357
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,199
there were also with him other little ships,

358
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,039
and there arose a great storm of wind,

359
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,800
and the waves beat into the ship

360
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:46,559
so that it was now full,

361
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,119
and he was in the hinder part of the ship,

362
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,919
asleep on a pillow,

363
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,440
and they awake him and say unto him,

364
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,479
master, carest thou not that we perish?

365
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,919
And he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea,

366
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,960
peace, be still,

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,619
and the wind ceased,

368
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,699
and there was a great calm,

369
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:07,600
and he said unto them,

370
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
why are you so fearful?

371
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,759
How is it that you have no faith?

372
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,639
And they feared exceedingly and said one to another,

373
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,039
what manner of man is this,

374
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,959
that even the wind and the sea obey him?

375
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,279
He's God.

376
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,839
He's God.

377
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,600
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

378
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
again, it's a familiar portion of scripture.

379
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,320
In fact, if you've been in church for any length of time,

380
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,239
I'm sure if you were in Sunday school as a child,

381
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,859
you probably heard a Bible account,

382
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:41,579
a teacher that taught about Jesus calming the sea.

383
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:44,200
And it's a familiar Bible account,

384
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,540
but I hope this evening that maybe we could put ourselves

385
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,100
with the disciples just for a moment into that ship

386
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,940
and see how fearful they were with regard

387
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,380
to the certainty of tragedy

388
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,980
because of the storm that had raised up,

389
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,579
and they were fearful,

390
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,380
and they said, master, carest thou not that we perish?

391
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,140
And I mean, to see the Lord Jesus Christ walk out

392
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,100
and to say, peace, be still,

393
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,700
and immediately there was a calm.

394
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
That's amazing.

395
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,579
And sometimes I believe that one of the dangers for us

396
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:22,540
as the people of God and the longer that we walk

397
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,100
with the Lord is sometimes these things

398
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,540
can just become commonplace.

399
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,579
Oh yeah, we know about that.

400
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,420
We know that he calmed this.

401
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,660
But we think about the power of our Lord.

402
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,339
Why is it that I would say Jesus is all the world to me?

403
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,760
Number one, because of who he is.

404
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,459
He's God.

405
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:40,100
Number two, because of his mighty power.

406
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,459
And I think about the power of God.

407
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:43,339
Listen, it is unlimited.

408
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,660
He can calm the storm in your life.

409
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,899
He can calm the seas that are raging in your life.

410
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,500
And we think about the power of God over disease

411
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,299
and sickness and all of those things.

412
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,899
And we understand this evening that when we live here

413
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,100
in this 21st century and we're dealing

414
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,339
with all of the difficulties and adversities

415
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:06,619
that we deal with, that we must be mindful

416
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,420
of the mighty power of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

417
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,540
He says this before he would ascend to heaven

418
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,899
in Matthew chapter 28.

419
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:15,859
Look over there with me.

420
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,980
We'll finish with this portion of scripture

421
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,299
as we think about the mighty power of the Lord.

422
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:23,299
And we think about this.

423
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,339
Of course, we often reference the Great Commission

424
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:28,980
and we should because it is the responsibility

425
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,299
of the child of God to proclaim the gospel

426
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,260
to a lost and dying world.

427
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,779
Jesus came in verse number 18 of Matthew 28

428
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:38,980
and he spake unto them.

429
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,779
And notice what he says.

430
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:45,779
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

431
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:47,100
He didn't say some power.

432
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,980
He didn't say most power.

433
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,980
He said, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

434
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,700
Notice in verse number 19, it says,

435
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,700
go ye therefore and teach all nations,

436
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,140
baptizing them in the name of the Father

437
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,299
and the Son of the Holy Ghost,

438
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,980
teaching them to observe all things

439
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,380
whatsoever I have commanded you.

440
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,779
And lo, I am with you all way,

441
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,420
even unto the end of the world, amen.

442
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,940
I mean, this passage of scripture

443
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,260
has so much great truth in it.

444
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,140
But as we focus upon the mighty power of the Lord,

445
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,820
we see that he says to these disciples,

446
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,299
he will soon be, if you look at the timeline

447
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,619
and you look at Matthew 28

448
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,339
and you couple it with Acts chapter number one

449
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,299
and giving the last of the Great Commission,

450
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,779
then the Ascension, you can read Luke 22 as well

451
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,380
and kind of see what's going on there with this record,

452
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,140
excuse me, Luke 24, and see the Ascension of the Lord.

453
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,619
And these disciples would hear the Lord Jesus Christ say,

454
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,660
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

455
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,299
Go ye therefore and teach all nations.

456
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,380
And he gives that Great Commission.

457
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,100
And so he kind of, the book ends, if you will,

458
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,339
of the Great Commission.

459
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:05,339
On the front end of it is the fact that he says,

460
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,579
all power is given unto me.

461
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:12,059
On the back of the commission, he says,

462
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,100
I am with you all way, even unto the end of the world.

463
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,940
Now think about that.

464
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,980
We have this responsibility, this commission to go,

465
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,339
but the Lord in his declaration and giving this commission,

466
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:29,619
he says, I have all power and I'll be with you.

467
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:30,899
Isn't that precious?

468
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:33,019
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

469
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,320
I hope that you would say, as the songwriter said,

470
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,700
Jesus is all the world to me.

471
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,820
And I have three more reasons that I'll give you next week

472
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,700
as to why he is all the world to me,

473
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,799
but when we start this and evaluate the scriptures,

474
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,719
I would say number one, because of who he is,

475
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,179
and number two, because of his mighty power.

476
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,020
Let's pray.

477
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,840
Father, we love you.

478
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,700
We thank you for loving us.

479
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,580
Thank you for the word of God.

480
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,659
Thank you for the truth that is given to us in thy word

481
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,700
with regard to the life and ministry

482
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,940
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

483
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,940
I thank you for the truth of the incarnation,

484
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,619
for the truth of your word with regard

485
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,780
to the purpose of Christ's birth,

486
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,539
that it was prophesied and it was fulfilled.

487
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:24,440
And we find that the purpose was to go to that cruel cross,

488
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,599
to suffer and bleed and die.

489
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,239
We thank you for the opportunity to look

490
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,840
at these portions of scripture this evening

491
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,919
with regard to the person of Jesus Christ,

492
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,039
with regard to the power of Jesus Christ.

493
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,200
God, I pray that our hearts have been encouraged

494
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,140
in these few moments of studying thy word,

495
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,359
to understand that you indeed are God

496
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,520
and that you do possess all power

497
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,359
and that you've promised to be with us.

498
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,960
I pray that we would go in the power

499
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,159
of the Holy Spirit of God.

500
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,039
And I pray that we would walk with thee.

501
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,000
Lord, even as we sang these wonderful songs this evening,

502
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
as you're all on the...

503
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,160
an altar living for Jesus.

504
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,920
Oh, when we understand who You are,

505
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,340
when we can answer that question

506
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,860
that we examined from Matthew 16 last week,

507
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,240
and when we can understand

508
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,840
that You're all the world to us

509
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,460
because of who You are,

510
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,260
because of the things that You've done,

511
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,000
because of what You continue to do

512
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,440
and how You continue to work,

513
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,420
that we would live for You.

514
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,460
That we would seek to please You and honor You

515
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,560
through all that we say and do.

516
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
Lord, we ask that You'd bless our time of prayer.

517
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,680
We thank You for the privilege of prayer.

518
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,240
We thank You that You're a God

519
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,960
who hears and answers prayer.

520
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,640
We pray that You'd meet with us

521
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
and bless our time.

522
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,680
For it's in Christ's name we pray, Amen.
