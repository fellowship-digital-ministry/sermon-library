WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
number 21, John chapter number 21 this evening, and we'll use this passage of Scripture as

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.760
a springboard into our message this evening.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.840
I said 21, sorry, John chapter number 20, John chapter number 20, and look with me,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:26.159
if you will, at verses 28 and 29, John chapter number 20 and verses 28 and 29, and the context

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.260
in which we're dealing with in this particular portion of Scripture is after the resurrection

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.000
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and He, of course, made Himself known, He appeared to many, and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.560
the Bible tells us in verse number 19 of John chapter number 20 that the same day evening,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.959
being the first day of the week when the doors were shut, where the disciples were assembled

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:51.840
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them, Peace be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.119
unto you.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.159
We find that Thomas was not there, according to verse number 24, the Bible says, but Thomas,

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.880
one of the 12, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.959
And they told them, they told Thomas about seeing the Lord, and he said that he would

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.760
not believe, and so on and so forth, but you find that in verse number 26, it says, and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.959
after eight days again, His disciples were within, and Thomas with them, then came Jesus,

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.019
the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:28.000
Then saith He to Thomas, Reach thither thy finger, and behold My hands, and reach hither

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.959
thy hand, and thrust it into My side, and be not faithless, but believing.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.639
The text that I wanted to use this evening is our springboard here in verses 28 and 29.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:42.260
Notice what Thomas says in verse number 28, and Thomas answered and said unto Him, My

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.400
Lord and my God.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.480
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.239
Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.680
Last week, we examined Matthew chapter number 16, and we looked at that question that Jesus

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.460
asked the disciples, Whom do men say that I am?

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.880
And of course, we looked at that passage of Scripture, and I mentioned this last week,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.839
that the question that was asked by Jesus to the disciples is just as important today

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.080
as it's ever been.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.839
The confusion of the people that we find in Matthew chapter number 16, remember the disciples

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.720
say, well, some think that you're John the Baptist, or Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or one of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.000
the prophets, and there was confusion amongst the people with regard to who Jesus is, who

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.779
He was, and we find that that confusion still exists today.

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.179
We understand that Paul said to the believers there in Corinth in 2 Corinthians chapter

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:50.259
number 4 that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, and we

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:56.259
have the responsibility of preaching the gospel and giving the gospel, and we understand that

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:03.639
we must know who Christ is, but we must be able to speak to those that we come into contact

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.820
with with regard to who is Jesus.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.500
We understood that though there was confusion amongst the people, that Peter answered with

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.139
great confidence, and he proclaimed, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.100
And what a powerful declaration that we see by Peter in that text of Scripture.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.619
And I think about this as I see Thomas' response in verse number 28, when Thomas says, my Lord

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:30.660
and my God.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.300
And when we understand who Jesus is, when we study the doctrine of Christ as we've entered

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.899
into as of last Wednesday evening, and we think about the person of Christ and who He

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:46.179
is, God in flesh, if I were to title the message this evening, and I'm sure it's going to be

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:53.820
a two-part message, I would simply entitle it this, Jesus is all the world to me.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.740
And there's a song with that title, Jesus is all the world to me, and the songwriter

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.860
said this, Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.179
He is my strength from day to day, without Him I would fall.

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.779
When I am sad, to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so.

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.179
When I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my friend.

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:22.179
Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trial sore.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:27.380
I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.179
He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest, golden grain.

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:35.339
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, He's my friend.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:39.179
Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be.

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:44.619
Oh, how could I this friend deny, when He's so true to me.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:48.739
Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night.

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:51.820
Following Him by day and night, He's my friend.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.339
Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.540
I trust Him now, I trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.660
Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.100
Eternal life, eternal joy, He's my friend.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.260
And I would echo what the songwriter said in that song that I just read.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.940
Jesus is all the world to me, I'm so thankful.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.579
The word of God reveals to us who Jesus is, and

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:28.820
that we have been privileged as believers to be in a place where

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.220
someone at some point brought the gospel to us.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.140
Whether you're the first believer in your family or

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.660
whether your parents were introduced to the gospel or your grandparents or

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.179
however far you dig down, someone brought the gospel to your family.

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:49.019
And you have the privilege of knowing through this precious book who Jesus is.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:52.260
And what a blessing because there are countless numbers of people around

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.140
the globe that are blinded with regard to the question, who is Jesus, who is He?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.739
Not only are those that are blinded, but we find that in a world where there are

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:09.059
over 7 billion people, a percentage of them have never

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.220
even heard the name of Jesus, yet even hearing the gospel.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.140
And how privileged we are, and we find that Thomas is my Lord and my God.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.820
Jesus says, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.700
And then think of this, the latter part of verse number 29.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.420
Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.339
I've not seen him, but I believe the record that he has given us, and

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.739
I am so thankful for the word of God.

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:39.059
Why is it that Jesus is all the world to me?

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.220
Well, I'm sure there's plenty of answers that we could give to that question, but

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.459
I've tried to categorize it into five particular areas this evening.

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:49.899
And I know that I won't get through all of them, so

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.339
this will be a multi-part series, but let's look at this.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.940
Number one, why is Jesus all the world to me?

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.179
Because of who he is, because of who he is.

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.500
He's God, he's God in the flesh.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.140
We think about this, look over in John chapter number one, and

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.660
we'll be all over the scriptures this evening.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.420
And looking at a number of portions, and seeing what the word of God tells us.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.899
Notice in John chapter number one, a very familiar portion of scripture.

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:18.500
In verse number one, the Bible says, in the beginning was the word, and

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.179
the word was with God, and the word was God.

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:23.260
The same was in the beginning with God.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.619
All things were made by him, and

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:29.019
without him was not anything made that was made.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.059
You notice in verse number 14, the Bible says, and

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:35.540
the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.980
And we beheld his glory.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.299
The glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:46.179
Look at the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number two.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.019
Philippians chapter number two, and

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:52.980
look at verses five through 11 of this portion of scripture.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:57.859
Philippians chapter number two, beginning in verse number five.

00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:01.540
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.299
who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:09.579
made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.619
was made in the likeness of men.

00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:15.179
Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.260
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.100
Wherefore, God also hath highly exalted him, and

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.940
given him a name which is above every name.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.140
The name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven, and

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.179
things in earth, and things under the earth.

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:33.020
And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.299
to the glory of God the Father.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.020
In the book of Hebrews, and of course,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.580
we studied through the book of Hebrews this calendar year.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.940
But we find that in Hebrews chapter number two,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.940
that the Bible tells us how that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.260
he came in the seed of Abraham.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.859
It says in verse number 16 of Hebrews 2, for

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:56.940
verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.460
he took on him the seed of Abraham.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.739
And so we begin to understand this evening who he is.

00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:08.900
We understand the answer that Peter gave to that question that was asked last week.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.900
Whom do men say that I am?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.780
And we find that there were some that said John the Baptist, and

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.460
others that were given as answers.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.979
And Peter says, thou art the Christ, after Jesus then says, but

00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:20.539
whom say ye that I am?

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.140
Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.979
And we find the word of God teaches us we could read about, study the incarnation,

00:09:26.979 --> 00:09:30.460
and understanding even the portions of scripture that we've just read.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.659
But when we consider who he is, we must consider his humanity.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:37.460
The humanity, he took upon himself the form of a man.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.580
He came in the likeness of men, put upon himself the form of a servant,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.219
came in the likeness of men.

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:46.020
And so we think about his humanity, we could ask this question,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:51.500
how do we know what evidence do we have with regard to the humanity of Christ?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.859
In Matthew chapter number four, in verse number two,

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:57.260
the Bible tells us that he was hungry.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.020
We find that, of course, it was after the

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.840
the time of fasting and the Bible says and when he had fasted 40 days and 40

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.360
nights he was afterward and hungered the Bible tells us in the book of John in

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.560
the fourth chapter you remember the situation where he said that he must

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.200
needs go through Samaria and he meets the woman at the well and in John

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.840
chapter 4 verses 6 & 7 the Bible tells us that he was thirsty we find that

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.440
Jesus in Mark chapter number 4 he's in the ship and the Bible says that he was

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.700
asleep in the in the hinder part the the back part of the ship why he was

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.380
tired and so we see those revelations to us in the Gospels with regard to the

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:41.740
humanity of Christ that he was a man and he had to come in the likeness of men so

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.620
that he could die in our place so that he could provide the sacrifice that

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:52.100
would be acceptable for our redemption so we see his humanity but we also see

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:58.200
his deity and just as we'd say that he was tired remember when he woke up as

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.160
they came and they were the disciples were just concerned and I see them kind

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.000
of rushing in and saying master carest thou not that we perish what does he do

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.880
he goes out and he rebukes the wind and the waves and says peace be still and

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.600
there's a calm and he demonstrates his power we think about the truth if you

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.860
would turn to the book of Mark chapter number two and notice with me I don't

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.240
have time to read the entirety of the portion of Scripture but in this passage

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.600
of Scripture we find that Jesus in thinking about considering not only his

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.360
humanity but his deity that he is God that he forgave sin we referenced this

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.560
portion briefly a few weeks ago but you'll understand that Jesus was there

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.480
and he told this man that thy sins be forgiven in verse number five this was

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.980
the man that his friends were concerned about his condition he was one that was

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.140
sick of the palsy and they brought him in through the roof because there were

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.100
so many people they couldn't get in and Jesus saw them and saw this man and said

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.100
thy sins be forgiven thee and those that were sitting around those religious

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.780
leaders the scribes in particular in verse number seven they say this who can

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:16.300
forgive sins but God only who can forgive sins but God only you know I

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.680
can't forgive you of your sins you can't forgive me of my sin but God is

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.400
the one that forgives we find that throughout the Old Testament we find the

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.100
reference that our God is ready to pardon ready to forgive with thee there

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.400
is forgiveness and what a blessing to understand that we find in first John

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.780
chapter number one that if we confess our sins that he is faithful and just to

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.740
forgive right to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and what a blessing to

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.940
understand they say who can forgive sins but God only and so Jesus says at the

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.120
end of verse number eight why reason you these things in your hearts and then

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.260
as he's there talking in verse number ten he says that you may know that the

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.480
Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins he sayeth to the sick of

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.040
the palsy I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.000
house and immediately in verse number twelve that man arose took up his bed

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and went forth the Bible says that they were all amazed and glorified God saying

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.540
we never saw it on this fashion and so he forgave sins why because he's God we

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.340
see his deity we see that he raised the dead of course we could look at a few

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.180
examples in the Gospels my mind races to the one that's probably the most

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:35.620
familiar to us in John the the Gospel of John in chapter 3 11 you remember that

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.340
Lazarus was sick and we look at the passage of Scripture we find that he

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.920
Jesus was made aware of the sickness of Lazarus and he comes and they were

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.000
saying things such as this if you would been here if you would have been here my

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.600
brother wouldn't have died they believed that Jesus was able to heal Lazarus of

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.920
his sickness why well there were many that were healed throughout the life and

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.520
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ the disciples had witnessed those things and

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:13.220
Jesus here did not go he tarried his departure there was a delay in his

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:18.140
leaving why for the glory of God for the work for the fact that he says to the

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:24.580
disciples early in the passage that they would would be just encouraged that they

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.580
would grow in their faith he says that he was glad for their sakes that they

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:33.740
were that he was not there to the intent that you may believe and not only did

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.280
Mary and Martha understand that if Jesus had been there he could have

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.340
healed Lazarus but there were some that were gathered there that were Jews that

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.840
were lamenting the death of Lazarus and after Jesus wept these Jews say it's

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.360
recorded in verse number 37 they say amongst themselves could not this man

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.540
which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.280
have died the miracle that had taken place back in John chapter number nine

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.580
with regard to the healing of the man that was born blind was fresh on the

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.240
minds of these Jewish people and they say after Jesus wept they said well if

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.120
he had been here I mean he healed the man that was born blind certainly he had

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.320
the power to have healed this man so that he did not die but Jesus purposed

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.220
and he did not go to heal him why because he was gonna raise him from the

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.340
dead he'd been dead for four days you remember the response the pushback if

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.340
you will that was received when he said that they should move the stone and you

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.640
find that he says take away the stone in verse number 39 and there's just a level

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.860
of objection if you will for Martha when she says by this time he stinketh he had

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.620
been dead four days but Jesus will proclaim in verse number 43 with a loud

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.800
voice Lazarus come forth the Bible tells us that he that was dead came forth

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.160
bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.080
napkin Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go Wow what an amazing truth

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.120
of the Word of God we find that there were many that responded in believing

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.220
because of what they had seen and we think about this why is Jesus all the

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.740
world to me because of who he is he's God we see his humanity throughout the

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:34.040
Gospels we see his deity that he is God in flesh notice with me not only because

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.580
of who he is but because of his mighty power think about the power of Christ we

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.920
understand as we read the Word of God and we've mentioned about the attributes

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.000
of God that our God is omnipotent that he has all power the Lord God omnipotent

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.560
reigneth and what a blessing to read through the Word of God and to see the

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.420
power of God demonstrated and of course it's declared for us many times we see

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.460
during the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ of his great power his

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.020
mighty power I'll list a number of things we see number one his power over

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.460
demons look in the book of Luke if you will and chapter number eight and I'll

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.260
give you the entire portion of which you could go back and read I won't have time

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.620
to read the entirety of these portions of Scripture but in Luke chapter number

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:28.000
eight in verses 26 through 39 you'll read about the account in which Jesus

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.240
had crossed over the lake and they'd gone over the sea there and they went to

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.120
the country of the Gadarenes and as they're there they meet this man that is

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.400
possessed with a demon and the Bible tells us in verse number 27 that he had

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.040
devils a long time and wear no clothes neither a boat in any house but in the

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.900
tombs and Jesus will ask him in verse number 30 what is thy name and he said

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:57.040
legion because many devils were entered into him we find that Jesus demonstrated

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:03.480
his power over the demons in fact the demons they know who Jesus is James says

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.240
that the devils believe in tremble in verse number 28 we say that we see that

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.600
it says when he saw Jesus he cried out fell down before him and with a loud

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.600
voice said what have I to do with the Jesus thou son of God most high I

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.260
beseech thee torment me not and Jesus will rebuke these demons and heal this

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.180
man and of course we find that he's then clothed in his right mind sitting at the

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.420
feet of Jesus being instructed the people that were there in the city they

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.380
besought him to depart from them they wanted him to leave because of all that

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.300
had taken place and this man was begging the Lord to be able to go with him it

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.059
says in verse number 38 that he besought him that he might be with him

00:18:44.059 --> 00:18:48.559
but Jesus sent him and said that he was to be a testimony in his own community

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:54.000
there and to show them how great things God hath done unto thee and the Bible

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.080
tells us that he went his way and published throughout the whole city how

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.160
great things Jesus had done unto him and so when we think about the mighty power

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.140
of God we see the power of Christ over demons over disease we've mentioned

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.720
already some reference with regard to the way in which our God is able to heal

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.619
we mentioned John chapter 9 with the man that was born blind you think about

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:19.600
John chapter number 5 I've often looked at John chapter number 5 and in

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.920
reference that portion of Scripture is when the impotent man meets the

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:30.160
omnipotent God and that man was lame and Jesus asks him a question in John

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.040
chapter number 5 and it's a he'd been there for 38 years he had this

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.840
infirmity for 38 years and Jesus says in verse number 6 wilt thou be made whole

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:46.400
now we understand that if you had an infirmity for that period of time and

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.040
someone came and asked you if you wanted to be made whole you would answer

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.400
absolutely notice in verse number 7 it says the impotent man answered him sir I

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.040
have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.000
coming another step at that

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.519
down before me, Jesus saith unto him,

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:08.679
rise, take up thy bed, and walk."

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:10.060
Can you imagine?

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.640
38 years, impotent.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.119
He's there at the pool of Siloam,

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:18.100
the Bible talks about in the first several verses,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.239
again, we don't have time to look at all of it,

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:23.360
but we find that he had desired to be healed

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.959
and yet had no hope or no expectation,

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:29.280
and Jesus comes and says,

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:30.719
will thou be made whole?

00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:32.600
And he says, I have no one to let me in,

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.799
and Jesus says, rise, take up thy bed, and walk,

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.880
and immediately the man was made whole

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.040
and took up his bed and walked.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.680
On the same day was the Sabbath,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.520
of course he received some just negative response

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.880
from the Jews because of that,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.799
but this is a miraculous demonstration

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:53.319
of God's power over disease.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:56.080
I think about the woman with the issue of blood.

00:20:56.119 --> 00:21:00.279
She spent all of her living with going to the physicians

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:02.680
and trying to find some way to be healed

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.400
of this problem that she had,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.400
and she spent all of her substance and yet was no better.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.879
She said this, and she knew that Jesus was coming that way,

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:17.160
she said, if I could just touch the hem of his garment,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.680
and the people were thronging him

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.800
and all the things that are going on,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.319
and she touches the hem of his garment,

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:24.419
and of course Jesus says, who touched me?

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:26.900
The disciples kind of look around,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.459
and what do you mean who touched you?

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:31.459
And he knew that virtue had been departed,

00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:34.620
and she came and he said, thy faith hath made thee whole,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.379
and she was immediately healed.

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:40.339
The power of our God, the power of Christ

00:21:40.339 --> 00:21:43.620
demonstrated over demons, over disease, over death.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.220
We mentioned it already in John chapter 11,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.220
and you see his ability to raise them from the dead.

00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:54.739
We find that he, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:57.660
he conquered sin, death, and the grave,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.379
and we understand this thing of death.

00:22:00.379 --> 00:22:04.940
In fact, I believe that even as we've gone through 2020,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.419
I know that I've mentioned a number of times

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:09.339
that there are a number of people in our world

00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:12.259
that are more aware of their mortality

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:14.539
than perhaps had been the case prior

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:17.259
to what we've been dealing with here in 2020.

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:19.639
In fact, it's given some very unique opportunities

00:22:19.639 --> 00:22:21.839
of witness for a number of years.

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:23.320
I was at the pastor's conference yesterday,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320
and for a number of years,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.520
and I was talking to some people

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.300
about the fact that we've always said,

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.460
hey, if you were to die today,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.279
are you 100% sure that you'd go to heaven?

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:34.160
We understand the certainty of death,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.919
but what a joy to know the reality,

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.639
the certainty of heaven,

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:39.940
and as was pointed out, man wants to die,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.559
but we find that Jesus,

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:43.960
not only did he raise people from the dead,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.440
but we understand that he conquered sin,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.320
death, and the grave,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.240
and someone said this,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.559
when we think about death for a believer,

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:55.679
it's simply a doorway to enter,

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:59.279
to leave this life and enter that life,

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:03.240
and what a blessing to think about the reality of heaven

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.279
and being with our Savior for all of eternity.

00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:09.039
Over nature, number four, over nature,

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.559
because of his mighty power,

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:11.759
in Mark chapter number four,

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:14.960
turn over and look at that passage, if you will, with me,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.880
and this is just a powerful passage of scripture.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.119
I referenced it a moment ago

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:24.039
when I spoke about the fact that he was asleep

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:26.119
on a pillow in the ship,

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:27.839
but notice with me in verse number 35,

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:28.679
the Bible says,

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:30.000
the same day when the evening was come,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.119
he saith unto them,

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.220
let us pass over unto the other side,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.600
and when they had sent away the multitude,

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.000
they took him even as he was in the ship,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.199
there were also with him other little ships,

00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:43.039
and there arose a great storm of wind,

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.800
and the waves beat into the ship

00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:46.559
so that it was now full,

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.119
and he was in the hinder part of the ship,

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:49.919
asleep on a pillow,

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.440
and they awake him and say unto him,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.479
master, carest thou not that we perish?

00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:59.919
And he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea,

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.960
peace, be still,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.619
and the wind ceased,

00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:06.699
and there was a great calm,

00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:07.600
and he said unto them,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.440
why are you so fearful?

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.759
How is it that you have no faith?

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.639
And they feared exceedingly and said one to another,

00:24:13.639 --> 00:24:16.039
what manner of man is this,

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:19.959
that even the wind and the sea obey him?

00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:21.279
He's God.

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.839
He's God.

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:25.600
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.440
again, it's a familiar portion of scripture.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.320
In fact, if you've been in church for any length of time,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.239
I'm sure if you were in Sunday school as a child,

00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:36.859
you probably heard a Bible account,

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:41.579
a teacher that taught about Jesus calming the sea.

00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:44.200
And it's a familiar Bible account,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.540
but I hope this evening that maybe we could put ourselves

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.100
with the disciples just for a moment into that ship

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.940
and see how fearful they were with regard

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.380
to the certainty of tragedy

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.980
because of the storm that had raised up,

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.579
and they were fearful,

00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:03.380
and they said, master, carest thou not that we perish?

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.140
And I mean, to see the Lord Jesus Christ walk out

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.100
and to say, peace, be still,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.700
and immediately there was a calm.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.700
That's amazing.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.579
And sometimes I believe that one of the dangers for us

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:22.540
as the people of God and the longer that we walk

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.100
with the Lord is sometimes these things

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.540
can just become commonplace.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.579
Oh yeah, we know about that.

00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:28.420
We know that he calmed this.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.660
But we think about the power of our Lord.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.339
Why is it that I would say Jesus is all the world to me?

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:35.760
Number one, because of who he is.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.459
He's God.

00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:40.100
Number two, because of his mighty power.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.459
And I think about the power of God.

00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:43.339
Listen, it is unlimited.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.660
He can calm the storm in your life.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.899
He can calm the seas that are raging in your life.

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:54.500
And we think about the power of God over disease

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.299
and sickness and all of those things.

00:25:56.299 --> 00:25:59.899
And we understand this evening that when we live here

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:02.100
in this 21st century and we're dealing

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.339
with all of the difficulties and adversities

00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:06.619
that we deal with, that we must be mindful

00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:10.420
of the mighty power of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.540
He says this before he would ascend to heaven

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.899
in Matthew chapter 28.

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:15.859
Look over there with me.

00:26:15.859 --> 00:26:17.980
We'll finish with this portion of scripture

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.299
as we think about the mighty power of the Lord.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:23.299
And we think about this.

00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:26.339
Of course, we often reference the Great Commission

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:28.980
and we should because it is the responsibility

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.299
of the child of God to proclaim the gospel

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:34.260
to a lost and dying world.

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:37.779
Jesus came in verse number 18 of Matthew 28

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:38.980
and he spake unto them.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.779
And notice what he says.

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:45.779
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:47.100
He didn't say some power.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.980
He didn't say most power.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.980
He said, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.700
Notice in verse number 19, it says,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.700
go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.140
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.299
and the Son of the Holy Ghost,

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:08.980
teaching them to observe all things

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.380
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.779
And lo, I am with you all way,

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:17.420
even unto the end of the world, amen.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.940
I mean, this passage of scripture

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.260
has so much great truth in it.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.140
But as we focus upon the mighty power of the Lord,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.820
we see that he says to these disciples,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.299
he will soon be, if you look at the timeline

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:31.619
and you look at Matthew 28

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:34.339
and you couple it with Acts chapter number one

00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:36.299
and giving the last of the Great Commission,

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:38.779
then the Ascension, you can read Luke 22 as well

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:42.380
and kind of see what's going on there with this record,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.140
excuse me, Luke 24, and see the Ascension of the Lord.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.619
And these disciples would hear the Lord Jesus Christ say,

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:51.660
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.299
Go ye therefore and teach all nations.

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.380
And he gives that Great Commission.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.100
And so he kind of, the book ends, if you will,

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.339
of the Great Commission.

00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:05.339
On the front end of it is the fact that he says,

00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:07.579
all power is given unto me.

00:28:07.579 --> 00:28:12.059
On the back of the commission, he says,

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:16.100
I am with you all way, even unto the end of the world.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.940
Now think about that.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.980
We have this responsibility, this commission to go,

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.339
but the Lord in his declaration and giving this commission,

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:29.619
he says, I have all power and I'll be with you.

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:30.899
Isn't that precious?

00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:33.019
Why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:35.320
I hope that you would say, as the songwriter said,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.700
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.820
And I have three more reasons that I'll give you next week

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.700
as to why he is all the world to me,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.799
but when we start this and evaluate the scriptures,

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.719
I would say number one, because of who he is,

00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:50.179
and number two, because of his mighty power.

00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:51.020
Let's pray.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.840
Father, we love you.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.700
We thank you for loving us.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.580
Thank you for the word of God.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.659
Thank you for the truth that is given to us in thy word

00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:01.700
with regard to the life and ministry

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.940
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.940
I thank you for the truth of the incarnation,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.619
for the truth of your word with regard

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:14.780
to the purpose of Christ's birth,

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.539
that it was prophesied and it was fulfilled.

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:24.440
And we find that the purpose was to go to that cruel cross,

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.599
to suffer and bleed and die.

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:28.239
We thank you for the opportunity to look

00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:30.840
at these portions of scripture this evening

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.919
with regard to the person of Jesus Christ,

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:37.039
with regard to the power of Jesus Christ.

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:39.200
God, I pray that our hearts have been encouraged

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.140
in these few moments of studying thy word,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.359
to understand that you indeed are God

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:47.520
and that you do possess all power

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.359
and that you've promised to be with us.

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:52.960
I pray that we would go in the power

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.159
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.039
And I pray that we would walk with thee.

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:01.000
Lord, even as we sang these wonderful songs this evening,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.200
as you're all on the...

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.160
an altar living for Jesus.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.920
Oh, when we understand who You are,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.340
when we can answer that question

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.860
that we examined from Matthew 16 last week,

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.240
and when we can understand

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.840
that You're all the world to us

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.460
because of who You are,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.260
because of the things that You've done,

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.000
because of what You continue to do

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.440
and how You continue to work,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.420
that we would live for You.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.460
That we would seek to please You and honor You

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.560
through all that we say and do.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.600
Lord, we ask that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.680
We thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.240
We thank You that You're a God

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.960
who hears and answers prayer.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.640
We pray that You'd meet with us

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.880
and bless our time.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.680
For it's in Christ's name we pray, Amen.
