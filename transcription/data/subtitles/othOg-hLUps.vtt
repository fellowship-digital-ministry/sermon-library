00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.799
Corinthians, chapter number one.

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:03.599
As you know, our theme for this year,

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:05.239
you see the banners behind me,

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:08.439
God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.920
And I am thankful for the grace of God.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.840
And I'm thankful that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.200
And the first message from this theme

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.799
was simply that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:21.399
And then we're gonna study through the book

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.840
of second Corinthians here on Sunday mornings.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.020
And last week we started chapter number one,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.920
made it through verse number 11.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.100
As we dealt with this subject,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.639
with suffering comes comfort.

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.599
With suffering comes comfort.

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:40.080
And I'm thankful that our God is the God of all comfort.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.680
The reality is that we all face times in life

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.599
with suffering and heartache and troubles and trials.

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:49.919
But to know that our God is the God of all comfort,

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.840
he comes alongside us, he encourages us,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.319
he strengthens us and he enables us.

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:57.720
And what a blessing that is.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.200
And I mentioned last week that in chapter one

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.439
in verse number one, that Paul begins by saying,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.919
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:10.599
And I made this statement and it's just a,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.239
it was part of the introduction and it really kind of flows

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.279
with the message this morning.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:18.440
There were some troubles in Corinth with regard

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.440
to the authority and the apostleship of the apostle Paul.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.800
And we find that he begins dealing with in verse number one

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120
that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.900
This was not something that he,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.319
a title that he placed upon himself.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.160
It was God's will for his life.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.720
God called him, God equipped him and God was using him.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480
And we find that as we begin reading in verse number 12

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.559
and look at the subject matter for this morning,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:49.000
we'll actually go through the second chapter,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.680
the fourth verse, and we'll find that as we look

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.000
through this text of scripture,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.379
that the apostle Paul continues to really address

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:00.019
the situation that was kind of an undercurrent issue

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.779
in Corinth, if you will.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.019
And I've titled the message this,

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.500
when you are misunderstood.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.100
I believe this morning that each of us

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.259
have experienced a misunderstanding.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.539
There's been a time in your life,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.860
there's been a time in my life,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.779
as we have relationships one with another,

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.580
that we will experience the situation

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.259
of being misunderstood.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.740
Maybe at some point you can think of in your mind,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.460
even at this moment, that you were the one

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.979
that was misunderstood.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.740
Or maybe you can think of a time in your life

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.580
where you were the one that misunderstood the other person.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.979
And we find that the specific reason

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.639
for being misunderstood may be discovered.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.100
It may be able for us to figure out

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.339
what led to the misunderstanding,

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.380
but the real goal is that the misunderstanding

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.419
can be cleared up.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.860
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.580
the Apostle Paul had given plans, he had plans,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.100
and he had really communicated those plans

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.899
to the church in Corinth, to the believers there in Corinth,

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.740
with regard to his plans to come and visit them,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.339
him go to visit them, and those plans changed.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.539
You ever have plans change?

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.339
I mean, change of plans that are outside of your control.

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.300
Change of plans at the direction of the Lord.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.199
Change of plans take place, and we find

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.600
that this change of plans of the Apostle Paul not going,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.759
though he said he would go, this resulted

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.059
in Paul suffering attack and being criticized.

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.139
In fact, as we study through the portion of scripture,

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.000
you'll find that they were saying

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.119
that he was dealing with fleshly wisdom,

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.080
that he was really a double-minded man,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.259
that he said yes, but he really meant no,

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.080
and he said no, but he really meant yes.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.479
And I mean, this attack and criticism

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.000
was all as a result of this simple misunderstanding,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.339
but we find as we look at the text of scripture

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.759
that Paul handled the situation,

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.679
number one, with humility, number two, with grace,

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.880
and number three, with maturity.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000
As I begin to look at this passage of scripture

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.559
and labor over the passage of scripture

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.839
of dealing with this on a Sunday morning

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.240
and preaching through the text,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.039
I find that in this text that the Lord records for us

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:19.399
Paul addressing the matter, and notice this, head-on.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.679
He deals with the matter head-on.

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:22.359
By the way, it's always good for us

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.440
when there's a misunderstanding to address it head-on,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.959
to deal with the situation.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:30.480
No doubt, the desire that Paul has

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.519
as you study through the passage of scripture

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.079
is to clear up the misunderstanding

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:38.000
and to restore unity amongst the brethren,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.959
ultimately for the purpose of God being glorified.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.799
We understand that the church in Corinth,

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:45.519
as we read the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.480
is already a church that is known or prone

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.920
to division, to carnality,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.279
and we read those things in the first book

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.640
of 1 Corinthians, and we find that

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.480
through those particular aspects,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.600
the Lord is not receiving the glory

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.959
that he ought to receive.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:04.799
Why?

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:06.640
Because there's so much stuff that's going on

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.799
inside of the church with regard to internal conflict

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:13.040
that they're not really accomplishing

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.920
the goal that God has for the church externally.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.880
And we find that ultimately,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.559
the desire of the apostle Paul

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.359
is that the Lord Jesus Christ be magnified,

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:26.200
not only in his life,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.119
but also in the lives of the believers there in Corinth.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.559
And so I asked this question on the onset

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.399
of the message this morning,

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.000
how do you respond?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.679
How do I respond when I'm misunderstood?

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.679
How do you respond when you're misunderstood?

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:42.959
Look at the passage with me.

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:44.640
We'll read just a few verses.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.519
We'll go through all of it

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.320
as we dig through the passage this morning,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.000
but look in verse number 12.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.480
The Bible says this,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.559
for our rejoicing is this,

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.640
the testimony of our conscience

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.600
that in simplicity and godly sincerity,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.359
not with fleshly wisdom,

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:03.200
but by the grace of God,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.880
we have had our conversation in the world

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.200
and more abundantly to you word.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.619
For we write none other things unto you

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.940
than what you read or acknowledge,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.980
and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.540
as also you have acknowledged us in part

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.059
that we are your rejoicing,

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.059
even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.940
And in this confidence,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.779
I was minded to come unto you before

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.820
that you might have a second benefit

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.059
and to pass by you into Macedonia

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.940
and to come again out of Macedonia unto you

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.019
and of you to be brought on my way toward Judea.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:47.619
That's where Paul's referencing again,

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.260
those travel plans.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.660
And he mentioned in verse 16,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.839
when I therefore verse 17 was thus minded,

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.339
did I use lightness or the things that I purposed,

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.579
do I purpose according to the flesh

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:03.380
that with me there should be yea, yea and nay, nay.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.559
But as God is true,

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:08.220
our word toward you was not yea and nay.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.899
For the son of God, Jesus Christ,

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.940
who was preached among you by us,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.019
even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus,

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.220
was not yea and nay,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.619
but in him was yea.

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:22.019
Notice verse 20,

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.500
for all the promises of God in him are yea,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.339
and in him, amen,

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.980
unto the glory of God by us.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.140
Now he would establish us with you in Christ

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.859
and hath anointed us is God,

00:07:36.859 --> 00:07:38.260
who hath also sealed us

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:41.420
and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.820
Moreover, notice in verse 22,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.859
verse 23, excuse me,

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:49.420
moreover, I call God for a record upon my soul

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.339
that to spare you,

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:54.500
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Not for that we have dominion over your faith,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.779
but our helpers of your joy,

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.899
for by faith ye stand.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.140
We'll look at the first four verses of chapter two

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.859
in just a moment.

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:07.100
I read this portion of scripture

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.380
so we'd kind of get the context of it.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.299
But as we look at this and answer the question,

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:16.019
when you are misunderstood and how do we handle,

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:17.820
how do we respond?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.260
I noticed, first of all,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.420
as I study this passage of scripture,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.980
first, if you're taking notes,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.500
number one, Paul examines himself.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.940
Paul examines himself.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.559
I mentioned a moment ago by way of introduction

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:33.219
that the apostle Paul handled the situation

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:36.619
with humility, with grace, and with maturity.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.179
And I believe that to be the case

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.380
because we see first that Paul examines himself.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.039
It's absolutely imperative that we understand

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.739
not only what Paul did and how Paul dealt with this,

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:49.640
but that we understand the importance

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.280
of incorporating this principle in our lives.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.619
Why do I say that?

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:57.059
Well, when you're misunderstood and when I'm misunderstood,

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:59.380
when we deal with misunderstandings in life,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.619
your flesh desires to respond in a certain way.

00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:04.460
Amen.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.739
There are times in which your flesh desires

00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:09.020
to defend yourself,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.280
to defend against the misunderstanding.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.440
There are times in which you may have the desire

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.419
to attack because of the misunderstanding

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:18.380
because guess what?

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.859
These people in Corinth,

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.940
they start attacking the apostle Paul.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.380
They start criticizing the apostle Paul.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.700
You said you were gonna come, but you didn't come.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.159
And you're not a man that's trustworthy.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:32.780
Your integrity is under question and your yea is nay

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.099
and your nay is yay and all of these things

00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:39.340
and your flesh doesn't always want to respond properly

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.859
to that type of situation.

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:44.140
And so we begin to look at this text of scripture.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.679
I believe that here,

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.539
the apostle Paul first examines himself

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:51.119
and it's an exemplary passage of scripture

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:53.419
for us to understand the importance

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:55.940
of incorporating that in our lives as well.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.820
So what do we do when we're misunderstood?

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.679
Well, we should get alone with God,

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:00.520
get alone with God,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.960
with the Lord and examine ourselves.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.660
Examine the situation, examine ourselves.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.880
Is there something that led to the misunderstanding, something that I did not do, something that

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.040
I am guilty of, the humility that is required?

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:23.360
I've often said, as we deal with the subject of the Lord's Supper, let a man examine himself.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.700
The subject matter of self-examination is so important and it's one that often is neglected

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.580
by the people of God because it's not always exciting to examine yourself.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.460
It requires humility, it requires honesty.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.900
And we find here that Paul evidently went through this process of self-examination as

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.340
he understood what was coming, what was being communicated from Corinth and the stir that

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.660
was going on there.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.620
He begins to examine himself and I find some conclusions that he reached as he went through

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.580
that process of self-examination.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:03.820
This first one, as we mentioned in verse 12, we also see it in verse 23, I believe that

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.500
Paul concluded, number one, that his conscience was clear.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.940
His conscience was clear, not only before the Lord, but also before the people of Corinth.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.420
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 12, for our rejoicing is this.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:26.220
Notice what he says, the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.980
not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.920
world and more abundantly to you word.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.980
We find that the apostle Paul, as he went through this process after being misunderstood

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.060
in all the stir and all the criticism and all that was taking place, he examines himself

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.660
and he concludes that he had a conscience that was clear.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.740
There was no conviction that he had as he got along with God that there was something

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.820
that he should have done or could have changed or had to make right.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.260
No, he had a clear conscience.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:07.580
In fact, in verse 23, he said, moreover, I call God for a record upon my soul that to

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.860
spare you, I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.140
Hold your place here in the book of 2 Corinthians and turn to the book of Acts, if you will,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.140
just for a moment.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.020
I want you to look at Acts 23 and 24.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.100
I want to note two verses of scripture that are so important as we begin to consider the

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.740
apostle Paul and how he lived his life and how he desired to have a conscience that was

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.340
a pure conscience.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:39.180
We find that in Acts 23 and verse number one, notice what Paul says as he's standing here

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:45.060
and giving account here before the religious leaders, the Sanhedrin, the Bible says in

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:53.380
verse one of Acts 23, and Paul earnestly beholding the council said, men and brethren, I have

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.720
lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.500
That's a powerful statement that the apostle Paul is able to make as he stands before this

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.140
religious body and begins to give an account.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.760
And he says that, that he's lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.380
But I want you to look forward in chapter 24 and verse number 16 of the book of Acts.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.820
And I want you to see how Paul kind of expounds upon this thought with regard to his conscience.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.340
And we see it in second Corinthians chapter one.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.500
Now Paul is standing before Felix and he's giving a testimony before Felix and in Acts

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.620
24 and verse 16, notice what the Bible says.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.260
And here in, do I exercise myself?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.940
Then notice what he says.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.700
To have, what's your Bible say, always.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:57.580
To have always a conscience, notice, void of offense toward God and toward men.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:05.900
He says that he's exercising, he's laboring, he's striving for this purpose to have always,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:12.740
not occasionally, not most of the time, but to always have a conscience that is void of

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.940
offense.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:20.180
But not only toward God, but notice toward men.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.180
Toward men.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:27.460
Well, it's okay that I'm not right with those people because I'm right with God.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.780
Paul says that he exercised himself to have always a conscience void of offense toward

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.300
God and toward men.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.300
By the way, if we're not right with one another, it's really a hard thing to be right with

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.880
God when we're holding offense in our hearts.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.500
We need to get those things right so that we can be right with God.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.420
And the reality this morning is that Paul says this was his desire.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.100
This is what he was laboring and striving for.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.020
And he mentions this to us in the book of Acts as he's giving his testimony before the

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:06.940
Sanhedrin and then before Felix and he's expressing that desire that he has.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.340
And now as we come to 2 Corinthians chapter number one and we see, and I mentioned last

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:17.580
week that the Bible is not just a book of principle, it's a book of practice.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.220
The Bible is not just a book of theory, it's a book of practice.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.900
And we take the principles and we see them practically lived out in our lives.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.980
And that's what Paul dealt with dealing with the comfort to begin the book of 2 Corinthians.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.580
And now Paul deals with this, this issue between the believers in Corinth and his change

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.900
of plans causing this, this conflict.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.780
And now how is he going to handle it?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.380
How is he going to address it?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.020
Well, he first examines himself.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.660
And after going through that process, he says, I have a, a conscience that is clear.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.140
Not only that, but I understand that as I look at the passage of scripture, according

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.460
to verse number 14, that Paul understood and he knew that he was accountable to the

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.460
Lord.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.740
And 2 Corinthians chapter number one in verse number 14, notice what Paul says, as he also

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:14.320
have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing, even as he also are ours.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.540
Notice what he says in the day of the Lord Jesus, there's coming a day that Jesus is

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540
coming back.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.540
Amen.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.620
Aren't you excited about that?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:30.900
What a day it will be when my Jesus, I shall see hallelujah for the truth that Jesus is

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.180
coming back.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:38.060
And the reality is that that truth, the biblical understanding of seeing my savior face to

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.040
face brings me great comfort and excitement and joy.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.700
But the reality is that the Bible teaches that every child of God, every believer is

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.940
accountable to God.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.260
And there is a Bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ, where we will stand before the

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Lord.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.620
And the reality is that the apostle Paul, as he goes through this process of examination,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.700
he is reminded in his own heart and his own life, and he'll deal with this in other aspects

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.220
and other portions of scripture.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.820
But he's understanding the very truth that every man must give an account.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.660
And Paul's accountable.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.500
And because of that, guess what Paul desires to be right with people.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.540
He wants to be right with God, but he wants to be right with people.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.340
And through this process of examination, Paul has in view eternity.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.500
He's not simply thinking about the temporal issue.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.180
He's understanding the eternal view, the long view, if you will.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.700
See sometimes when we're misunderstood, we only consider the temporal thing.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.940
We just, this isn't very comfortable having this misunderstanding.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.240
It's not very comfortable when my spouse isn't happy with me or, or my parents not happy

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240
with me.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.320
Or I just want this thing to be resolved and whatever.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.840
But Paul had this long view.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.840
I'm accountable to God.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.840
I'm going to stand before God.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.400
And it's important for us to understand.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.680
I find that Paul also, as he begins to share this truth with these believers, I believe

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.400
that he acknowledged the third thought here with regard to him examining himself, was

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.920
that he knew the character of God, amen, aren't you thankful that God has revealed to us in

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.560
his word, his character in his nature, but he also experienced that the character of

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.680
God impacted his own character.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.400
So what is God's character?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.360
Well verse 20, that all the promises of God in him are, are yay.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.700
And in him, amen, under the glory of God by us.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.820
By the way, someone noted that verse number 20, what a wonderful verse it is and how thankful

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.420
we are for the verse.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.260
Had it not been for a misunderstanding in Corinth, we may not have this verse in our

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.260
Bibles.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.619
And what a great truth that God reveals to us with regard to his character.

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:57.940
Listen, we stand on the promises of God, understanding that everything that God has promised will

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.980
come to fruition.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:06.000
That God is a God who is faithful and God makes promises and God has the ability to

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.140
fulfill every promise that he makes.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.340
To God be the glory.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.260
And as the apostle Paul understood the character and the nature of God as a child of God, as

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:24.300
a Christian, Paul understood that God's character in nature was influencing and impacting his

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.980
character in nature.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.860
In fact, as the apostle Paul would write, even in this book, if any man be in Christ,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.780
he is a new creature.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.660
Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:43.140
In 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 17, the things I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.619
We sing that song with the kids and we say this, there's been a great change since I've

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.619
been born again.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:54.780
And the reality is that as a believer, I should handle a misunderstanding different than I

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.500
did as an unbeliever.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.540
Amen.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.540
We find that Paul

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.440
Paul was a man who had operated with integrity.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.120
He was a man that understood the importance

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.280
of communicating effectively.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.280
He said this in verse number 19,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.480
well in verse 18,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.640
but as God is true,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.680
our word toward you was not yea and nay.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.580
See, Paul says I was the minister of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.920
And when I came to you,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.280
I wasn't coming to you

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.180
as some of these false teachers would come

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.760
and I'm not coming to rule over

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.880
to have dominion over you as he mentions in verse 24.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.020
No, I'm coming to impart truth to you.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.780
I'm coming to point you to Jesus.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.380
I'm coming so that you might be complete in Christ

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.780
so that you might have your joy complete and be full.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.220
He says in verse 24,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.540
that we're helpers of your joy.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.300
So as Paul is coming to these believers in Corinth

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.540
and as Paul would communicate

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.940
with these believers in Corinth,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.500
he understands that he was communicating

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.720
on the behalf of God.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.140
Notice in verse 19,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
for the son of God, Jesus Christ,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
and then notice this parenthetical,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.360
who was preached among you by us.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.100
Paul was preaching the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.940
I mean, listen,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.760
if he's preaching about the truth of the gospel

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.000
and he's preaching about salvation by grace

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.360
through faith alone,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.560
and that the only way to be saved is by the blood of Christ,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.520
he understands that he must operate with integrity.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.240
Because if he's not a man of integrity and character,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.240
then his message behind a pulpit is also under question.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.440
Does that make sense?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.020
And we find that the apostle Paul,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.500
he's examined himself.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.140
Let me very briefly look over at 1 Corinthians 16.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.300
It might just be a page or two over for you in your Bibles,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.540
but I wanna mention what Paul said

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.100
and really understanding the importance of what Paul said,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.300
even as he concluded the first letter

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.060
to the church in Corinth.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.720
In 1 Corinthians 16, in verse number five,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.560
notice the Bible says this.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.380
Now, I will come unto you

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.680
when I shall pass through Macedonia,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.820
for I do pass through Macedonia.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.020
And it may be that I will abide, yea,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.680
and winter with you,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.420
that you may bring me on my journey withersoever I go.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.840
Verse seven, for I will not see you now by the way,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.000
but I trust to tarry a while with you.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.840
What are those next words?

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.380
If the Lord permit.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.860
Is that what your Bible says?

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.100
If the Lord permit.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.320
By the way, I'm pretty confident that Paul was happy

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.340
that he said, if the Lord permit,

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.940
because there are times in our lives

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.620
and we can learn a great lesson from this

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.820
and we'll circle back to it

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.180
at the end of the message this morning,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.380
coupled with a truth from the book of James.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.620
But the reality is that I must live my life,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.020
yes, with integrity,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.720
but understanding if the Lord permit.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.900
And so Paul examines himself.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.860
I believe it's a crucial step in the whole process

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.260
of how we deal with, how we respond

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.300
when we are misunderstood.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.420
If you're sitting here this morning and say,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.780
I've never been misunderstood,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.860
we need to have you teach a lesson, amen.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.340
Because the reality is I believe this morning

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.900
that each of us could stand and say,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.580
yes, there've been times that I've been misunderstood.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.120
Maybe right now you're in the midst

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.780
of I'm misunderstood at the moment,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.480
like I'm dealing with something.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.240
But how do we respond to it?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.380
What do we do?

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.580
Because it's not as important for us to come to

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.880
and to find out the specific reason

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.760
for the misunderstanding, though that is an objective.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.840
The most important thing is that the misunderstanding

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.760
can be cleared up so that God might be glorified.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.980
So that there could be unity once again.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.980
So we find first of all that Paul, he examines himself.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.620
Number two, Paul explains himself.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.180
Paul explains himself.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.420
Let me say this,

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.700
explanation without examination can cause you trouble.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.380
Did you get it?

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.500
Explanation without examination can cause you trouble.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.340
Why?

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.440
Because you just start explaining yourself

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.940
and you start attacking and you start defending

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.340
and you've not examined yourself.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.860
I believe that it's absolutely important

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.780
that we understand this process

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.780
and that the examination precedes the explanation.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.740
Paul is able to say that he has,

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.420
as he speaks about this testimony of his conscience

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.900
to begin the whole section in verse number 12,

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.900
it's because he stepped back and he's examined himself,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.180
but now he's gonna explain himself.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.360
Now understand this, the truth with me this morning,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.020
you will never convince everyone.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.480
There may be a misunderstanding

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.320
that you will never be able to fully reconcile with someone

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.080
simply because they don't want to

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.080
or whatever circumstances that are outside of your control.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.480
And so we understand that.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.980
However, the apostle Paul provides an explanation

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.540
so that the believers here in Corinth

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.800
would understand the way that the plans change

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.020
and they would understand that he was not a man

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.520
that was lacking integrity.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.720
He was not a man who was saying one thing

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.120
while he meant something else.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.900
He's writing one thing while he really means something else.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.880
He's not a double-minded man.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.600
And so he seeks to provide explanation.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.280
Notice with me, I find first of all,

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.640
that he gives explanation with regard to his character,

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.080
to his character.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.820
We mentioned already in verse 12

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.180
where he talks about this pure conscience,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.480
a testimony of our conscience,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.980
that in simplicity and godly sincerity.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.820
Notice where he says, not with fleshly wisdom,

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.060
but by the grace of God,

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.460
we have had our conversation in the world.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.740
Notice where he says, and more abundantly to you, word.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.300
You know that Paul was under the microscope, so to speak,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.380
when he ministered in Corinth for a lengthy period of time.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.720
And so what does Paul appeal to?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.580
Paul appeals to his testimony, his character.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.100
Paul appeals to his time

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.900
in which he ministered there in Corinth.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.300
And he says, look, you know, yes, I've lived in the world.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.940
I've lived in various places,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.300
and God's led me to minister in a variety of places,

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.220
but understand that I was with you.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.980
You saw my character.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.460
Remember what he said to Timothy.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.500
We've finished in 2 Timothy last year

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.540
as we studied through 1 and 2 Timothy,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.220
but I'm reminded of what Paul says

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.360
in 2 Timothy chapter three in verse number 10,

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.000
when he says to Timothy,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.720
he's speaking about the apostasy and the false teachers

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.480
and all the things that are going on

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.840
and the perilous times in the last days

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.120
and all the characteristics of those false teachers

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120
and what have you.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.080
And he says in verse 10 of 2 Timothy chapter three,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.000
but thou has fully known my doctrine,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.520
manner of life, purpose, faith,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.300
long suffering, charity, patience,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.980
persecutions, afflictions,

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.940
which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.540
what persecutions I endured,

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.400
but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.240
What does Paul say?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.940
You fully know.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.500
I've been ministering.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.740
I've been serving.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.460
You've known my life.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.380
We find that as Paul is writing to the church in Philippi,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.700
he says to them in Philippians chapter number four

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.540
in verse number nine,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.340
as you note that verse of scripture,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.760
he says to these believers in Philippi,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.320
those things which you have both learned

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.160
and received and heard and seen in me do.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.120
The God of peace shall be with you.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.760
So what's Paul saying?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.920
These people that God allowed the apostle Paul

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.760
to minister to, they saw his life.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.720
They saw his character.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.440
And so now there's this misunderstanding.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.800
And if you've ever been misunderstood,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.680
you understand how it can hurt

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.580
when you're misunderstood.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.460
You can be attacked because of being misunderstood.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.280
And Paul says, my character is being questioned,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.280
but you've known my character.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.580
Notice what he says in verse 17.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.780
He says, when I therefore was thus minded,

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.880
notice what he says, did I use lightness?

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.700
In other words, was I being fickle?

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.620
Did I say, I'm just gonna come visit you

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.300
because that's what you wanted to hear?

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.720
Because you wanted me to come.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.660
So therefore, I just used this lightness

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.360
and said, oh yeah, I'm gonna come and visit with you.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.300
The reality is that Paul wasn't using lightness.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.680
He was being sincere in his communication.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.420
You ever have somebody say to you,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.180
hey, if you need anything, call me.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.500
But you really know they don't want you to call them?

00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.980
They're just saying it because they think

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.700
it's the right thing to say.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.860
Have you ever felt that way?

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.120
I mean, honestly, I felt that way at times.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.080
But the reality is that I know I've said to some people,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.200
even this week, because of some circumstances

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.040
that they faced, I've said to them,

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.840
hey listen, if you need anything, please give me a call.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.320
Please let me know.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.720
You know what the responses have been

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.560
from those three individuals that I can think of

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.560
right off the top of my head

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.160
that I've said that to this week?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.900
They said, pastor, you'll be the first person I call

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.860
if I need anything.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920
And I appreciate that.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.600
I thank the Lord for that, why?

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.800
Because I truly mean, if you need anything, let me know.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.480
How can I help you?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.740
We had some snow last week.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.500
We have some widows in our church.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.020
They don't need to be shoveling snow, amen?

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.980
Hallelujah, they don't need to be shoveling snow.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.100
I'm old too, I shouldn't, I'm just teasing.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.780
But the reality is that we wanna be able

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.780
to help folks if we need to.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.340
Paul's saying, I didn't use lightness.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.020
I didn't just say this to make you feel good.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.340
I was being sincere.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.180
Notice.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.340
Notice in verse 17, he continues or says this,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.180
or the things that I purpose,

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.740
do I purpose according to the flesh?

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.700
That with me there should be yay, yay, and nay, nay.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.380
So in other words, he's saying, listen,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.220
you're attacking me and you're criticizing me and saying,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.820
you know, he doesn't pray about anything.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.540
He's just operating in the flesh.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.060
No, Paul says that's not the case.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.320
It's not the case.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.940
The change was not a result of negligence.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.900
The change in plans was not a result of laziness.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.460
We find that the Apostle Paul,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.260
his yes was yes and his no was no.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.500
He was a man of integrity, but his plans changed.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.820
By the way, he said, if the Lord permit.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.820
There was some change of plans.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.800
So he first in his explanation mentions his character,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.300
but number two, he mentions his concern.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.900
Notice with me in verse 23,

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.660
he says, moreover, I call God for a record upon my soul.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.740
Notice where he says that to spare you,

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.900
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.020
What does Paul mean when he says to spare you?

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.780
I came not as yet to Corinth.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.140
Well, Paul understood as we get into the second chapter,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.920
we'll mention it, we'll see it clearly.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.100
Paul understood that he had this concern

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.820
for the believers in Corinth,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.100
but there were some really weighty things

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.860
that had to be dealt with in the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.220
There was open sin that was not even mentioned

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.620
amongst the Gentiles that was taking place

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.220
that Paul deals with in 1 Corinthians chapter number five,

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.380
and it was a heavy, heavy situation.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.700
And so Paul, he has this concern

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.580
for the believers in Corinth,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.060
and he didn't wanna come to them with heaviness

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.760
and cause them more sorrow.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.060
In other words, I believe that he wanted them

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.500
as we see in verse number 24.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.500
Notice where he says,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.660
not for that we have dominion over your faith.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.700
He's not coming in as a dictator

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.440
and having this dominion over them.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.940
No, he says that even though I'm an apostle,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.540
that's not my position.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.640
I am a helper of your joy, for by faith ye stand.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.260
By the way, I'm thankful that the Bible teaches

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.700
that every child of God is a priest before the Lord.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.100
You can go to God, you have direct access

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.540
to the throne room of heaven,

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.260
and what a joy to understand

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.300
that if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.460
if you have assurance this morning

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.420
that your sin has been forgiven

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.020
and that heaven is your home,

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.580
and the only way to have that done

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.020
is through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.900
then you have direct access with God.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.000
And Paul says that I'm a helper of your joy,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.040
but we find that he says that to spare you,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.820
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.220
It wasn't that he had no plan to go to Corinth,

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.020
even in the future, but he says as yet.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.340
The timing wasn't right.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.020
There needed to be some more time, some more space.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.200
There needed to be some more response.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.480
He needed to understand, and we mentioned in verse number one

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.660
how that he mentions about Timothy, our brother,

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.260
and it's understood or believed

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.260
that he had sent Timothy to find out,

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.020
even as he did in Thessalonica,

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.420
how things were going, and he finds this report,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.420
and so Paul was giving some space, if you will.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.020
Notice as we enter into the first verses

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.680
of chapter number two, he says in verse number one,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.620
as he continues the thought of that to spare you,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.780
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.860
In verse number one, he says,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.580
but I determined this with myself,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.360
that I would not come again to you in heaviness.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.780
That I would not come to you again in heaviness.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.860
Notice, for if I make you sorry,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.020
who is he then that maketh me glad,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.500
but the same which is made sorry by me?

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.700
And I wrote this same unto you,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.500
lest when I came, I should have sorrow from them

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.220
of whom I ought to rejoice,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.880
having confidence in you all,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.500
that my joy is the joy of you all.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.660
What is he saying?

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.020
He's saying, well, if I come to you,

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.240
and we're supposed to be rejoicing together

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.660
as brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.220
and yet I come with more heaviness

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.500
than I've made you sorrowful,

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.580
and we're not going to be rejoicing as we ought to rejoice,

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.220
so therefore, I did not come,

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.420
to spare you, I came not as yet unto Corinth.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.260
Why?

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.580
So that you could respond the way

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.380
that you should respond appropriately,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.460
and then I would be able to come,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.540
and we could rejoice together.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.060
And so Paul, as he provides this explanation

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.940
to these believers in Corinth,

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.580
he first mentions his character.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.780
He then mentions his concern

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.220
for these believers here in Corinth,

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.380
and his concern that they would grow,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.840
that they would not become more sorrowful

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.780
because of a heavy visit.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.660
But then we find this,

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.220
in verse number four of chapter two,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.240
as Paul provides explanation,

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.340
not only does he reference his character, his concern,

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.580
but number three, he mentions his charity.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.620
Notice what he says in verse number four.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.260
"'For out of much affliction and anguish of heart,

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.360
"'I wrote unto you with many tears,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.280
"'not that you should be grieved,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.060
"'but that you might know the love

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.740
"'which I have more abundantly unto you.'"

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.660
You know, Paul loved the people

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.540
that God called him to minister to.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.300
Paul taught the various churches

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.620
and the believers about the importance of love,

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.100
and loving one another,

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.140
and growing in their love one toward another.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.060
We find that he taught that because of the influence

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.820
of the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.940
where Jesus taught in John 13,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.980
a new commandment,

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.720
"'Give I unto you that you love one another

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.240
"'as I have loved you.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.360
"'By this, by your love one for another,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.580
"'shall all men know that ye are my disciples.'"

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.340
And we find that the apostle Paul,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.580
he loved these people in Corinth,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.260
and he expresses his charity to them.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.780
He expresses, notice,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.060
he says, "'Out of much affliction

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.460
"'and anguish of heart I wrote to you,'

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.900
but then he says this,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.460
"'with many tears.'"

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.840
The matter by which Paul was addressing

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.500
with this church in Corinth was a heavy matter.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.740
It was a difficult thing,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.740
and Paul was not using lightness.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.300
Paul was not just firing off a letter to them

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.140
and condemning.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.260
No, he wrote this with many tears.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.020
He was broken over the situation.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.500
He desired that they would receive the truth

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.880
and respond appropriately.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.720
Why?

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.380
Because Paul knew that not only would he stand before Christ

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.740
but they too would stand before Christ.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.260
So Paul, as he's referring to these

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.980
or responding to these accusations

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.660
and as he's explaining himself,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.400
he says that, "'I wrote this with much affliction

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.360
"'and anguish of heart,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.940
"'and I wrote with many tears.'"

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.420
And then notice the end of verse number four,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.960
"'Not that ye should be grieved,

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.400
"'but that ye might know the love

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.160
"'which I have more abundantly unto you.'"

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.640
Why do we, why did Paul make the decisions that he made?

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.440
Why did he write what he wrote?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.600
Why did he change his plans

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.920
the way that he changed his plans?

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.960
Because he had concern,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.040
but he also had charity,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.080
had love for these people in Corinth.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.960
He loved them.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.720
And because he loved them,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.560
he wanted to see them complete in Christ.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.960
He wanted to see them respond appropriately.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.360
Notice, if you will, in the book of Colossians

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.520
in chapter number one,

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.260
I want you to notice what Paul says here.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.400
There's a great important truth to understand

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.600
between Paul writing to the believers in 2 Corinthians

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.880
and Paul writing to the believers in Colossae.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.080
When Paul is writing to the believers in 2 Corinthians,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.020
Paul is writing to people that he knew personally.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.700
Paul is writing to people that he ministered to personally.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.700
Paul is writing to people that he knew their names.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.740
He was acquainted with them.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.820
He knew their families.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.900
He knew some of the things they struggled with.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.000
He ministered there for a decent amount of time.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.540
But now as he's writing to the believers in Colossae,

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.220
Paul didn't know these people personally.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.260
Paul simply heard about their faith.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.260
He heard, he'd received report.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.820
As you look in the first part of chapter number one,

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.420
you find that Epaphras had brought this report

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.460
and told them, the Apostle Paul,

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.140
about the faith of these people in Colossae

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.300
and it caused Paul to rejoice greatly.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.340
There's some people that got saved over there in Colossae.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.820
They were lost. They were sinners as we all were.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.220
At one point in our lives, we're lost and undone,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.460
but the gospel came forth and they received the gospel.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.900
They received the truth that Jesus is the only savior,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.380
that yes, I'm a sinner and he's the only savior

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.820
and I need to trust him.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.980
His finished work at Calvary, his death, his burial

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.580
and his resurrection so that I can be saved

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.380
and Paul's rejoicing in that.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.660
He's thankful that these people are saved.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.500
But he says to them at the end of the chapter,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.700
chapter one of Colossians one here,

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.300
notice in verse 28, notice what he says.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.700
Whom we preach, warning every man

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.260
and teaching every man in all wisdom

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.980
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.460
To be complete in Christ.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.980
He speaks about in the second chapter

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.580
about the fact that you're complete in him.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.540
And Paul says, spiritually speaking, my goal,

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.340
my desire for you, these people in Colossae,

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.420
why do I do the things that I do?

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.700
Because I want you to be able to stand complete before Christ.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.300
I want you to be established.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.460
and I want you to be able to stand and give a good

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.740
testimony before the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.580
So as we go back to 2 Corinthians chapter two,

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.820
and we begin to understand the Apostle Paul writing

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.820
to these believers in Corinth and helping to deal with

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.540
and address this misunderstanding,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.200
he's explaining himself and he says,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.080
I want you to know how much I love you.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.840
It's very interesting because it's in this same book

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.640
in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 15,

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.320
where Paul says, and I will very gladly spend

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.100
and be spent for you, though the more abundantly

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.720
I love you, the less I be loved.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.760
And here we find that the Apostle Paul,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.680
as he's writing to these believers in Corinth,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.440
he says, as he explains himself, remember my character,

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.240
but I want you to know how concerned I was for you.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.040
I wasn't concerned about me as much as I was concerned

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.640
about you and my charity, my love for you.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.440
As we looked earlier in 1 Corinthians chapter 16,

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.440
we find that Paul originally said, if the Lord permit.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.040
I believe that those few words, those four simple words,

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.840
if the Lord permit, that that should have helped

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.660
to prevent a misunderstanding.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.180
But you know, as much as you might try to do

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.260
to prevent a misunderstanding, you can't keep

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.560
a misunderstanding from taking place.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.100
As adequately as you think you've communicated,

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.260
as effective as a communicator as you think you might be,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.700
there are times that you will still be misunderstood.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.500
So what do we do?

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.120
How do we respond when we're misunderstood?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.120
This is practical Christian living right here.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.640
This is Paul sharing with us a testimony,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.000
a personal testimony of him being misunderstood

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.800
and how he responded.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.920
And I'm thankful that God put it in the Bible.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.720
Because we have an example this morning before us

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.520
of an individual that responded with humility

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.160
and grace and maturity.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.760
And when you're misunderstood and when I'm misunderstood

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.640
and when that next time comes, and it may be today,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.360
it may be tomorrow, I don't know, you don't know,

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.640
but when you're misunderstood,

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.440
how are you gonna respond to it?

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.520
And I would say that as we look at this portion

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.080
of Scripture that it first must begin with examination.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.000
Examine yourself.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.160
Take that step back.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.600
Helps to diffuse the whole situation anyway.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.920
And examine yourself and ensure that you have

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.600
that same level of a pure conscience

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.920
that Paul was able to write about,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.800
that he's able to say,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.360
I call God for a record upon my soul.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.440
That's powerful.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.320
Paul says, I operate with integrity.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.960
I'm examining myself.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.720
I'm gonna stand before Christ.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.340
I'm accountable to him and he's impacted the way

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.120
that I live and as I examine myself,

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.040
I come to the conclusion that I have this testimony

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.520
of our conscience, I can rejoice, as Paul says.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.920
And then, and maybe I should say only then,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.880
after the examination, then the explanation.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.920
Can I explain myself?

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.780
I'm sorry we had this misunderstanding

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.120
and I really wanna clear this up

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.720
and I think it'd be good for us to be able

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.780
to have this conversation as Paul begins to explain himself.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.280
I find that as you look and it doesn't end,

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.640
there's several more issues that Paul will deal with

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.880
with regard to the ministry throughout the next couple

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.560
of chapters here in the book of 2 Corinthians.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.440
But Paul, he loves these people in Corinth

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.600
and he knows that they're gonna stand before Christ

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.840
and he says, I wanna clear this up.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.160
Why?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.640
Because I want God to be glorified.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.760
I want God to be glorified because if there's division

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.600
and there's contention because of a misunderstanding

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.300
and all of this internal focus,

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.160
then we're not doing what God's called us to do

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.520
and God's not being glorified.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.560
So this morning, when you're misunderstood,

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.960
how do you respond?

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.240
What do you do?

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.240
Start with examination and then explanation.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.080
Let's pray together.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.360
Father, we love you.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.580
We thank you for loving us.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.440
We thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.980
Lord, I thank you for the portion of scripture

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:33.980
though it's important for us to understand

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.980
the historical context we gain from it,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.560
application for our own lives.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.800
Everyone with the sound of my voice today

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.220
has experienced a misunderstanding.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:58.860
God, I pray that you would help us to act and think,

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.200
respond biblically.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.880
Father, I pray that if there's one present

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.840
that's not sure of heaven,

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.160
though the message this morning

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.000
wasn't specifically on the gospel,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.440
we understand that all have sinned

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.200
and come short of the glory of God.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.720
The wages of sin is death,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.300
but the gift of God is eternal life

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.520
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.320
But God commendeth his love toward us

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.640
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.600
As it is appointed unto man once to die,

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.400
but after this, the judgment for whosoever

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.360
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.920
Lord, if there's one here this morning

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.360
that's not sure of heaven,

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.840
if they were to die today,

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.720
they do not have 100% confidence that heaven is their home.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.500
I pray the Holy Spirit of God would work

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.200
and move in their hearts and lives.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.680
They'd come to this old fashioned altar

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.780
and allow us to take a Bible

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.080
and show them how they could know for sure

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.540
that heaven is their home.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.900
I pray for every child of God.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.380
Would you help us as new creatures,

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.380
as saved individuals to deal with misunderstandings

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.180
godly and appropriately,

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.580
with humility and with grace and with maturity.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.080
We pray that you'd move and work as only you can

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.060
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:21.900
Would you stand?
