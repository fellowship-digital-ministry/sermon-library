1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
And last week, we had the opportunity to study

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,719
in the Old Testament, we're in the book of Isaiah,

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,720
and we noted how Hezekiah trusted the Lord

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,359
in the midst of great adversity.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,560
And if you were here last week,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,399
we looked at that situation,

7
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,600
and Hezekiah believed the record of creation

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,120
that God had given.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,879
He knew that God was the creator God,

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,200
and he knew that the creator God was his helper.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,040
And we mentioned last week,

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,600
as we studied the passage of Scripture there in Isaiah

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,439
with regard to the time of Hezekiah's reign there

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,439
and the attack or the threat of the Assyrians,

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,680
we find that he responded to that great adversity

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
with fear, excuse me, with faith,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,720
and with dependence on God alone to help.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,479
Faith conquered his fear.

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,919
No doubt, there were opportunities

20
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,799
for the people of God, Judah,

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,119
to have fear with regard to the threats

22
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,520
and all that had taken place.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,360
The Assyrians were the world power

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,000
and had conquered many a people group,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but Hezekiah was a man of faith.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
Hezekiah was a man that believed God,

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,720
that trusted God, and he knew that God alone

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,599
was able to help.

29
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,480
He knew that there was nothing that he could do

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,519
and of himself.

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,199
It was all through the power of God the creator

32
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,519
that was his helper.

33
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,720
Judah, of course, as we finished up last week,

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,559
was miraculously delivered,

35
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,080
and the Assyrians were defeated.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,959
This morning, as we look here in Acts chapter number four,

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,599
I wanna look at what takes place here with the disciples.

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,879
We understand that at this particular time in history,

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,800
as we look at this account in Acts chapter number four,

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,080
that the Lord Jesus Christ had lived

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,959
his perfect, sinless life.

42
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,959
The record of the life of Christ

43
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,160
is provided through the gospels.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,319
We find that he, of course, had gone

45
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,080
to the cross of Calvary.

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,160
He had bled and died.

47
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,919
He had been buried in a borrowed tomb,

48
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:58,879
and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

49
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,080
We find that the book of Acts records for us

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,839
in the first chapter his ascension to heaven,

51
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,160
and before he ascended to heaven,

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,680
he gave instruction to his disciples,

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,679
to those that would carry on the work of the Lord

54
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:17,039
with regard to what we refer to as the Great Commission.

55
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,160
That work, as the disciples were seeking to fulfill

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
the work that God had given them to do,

57
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:28,199
was met with serious, I would say intense, opposition.

58
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,000
We find that many times we begin to read

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,080
through the book of Acts, and as you continue

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,199
through the first several chapters of the book of Acts,

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,800
you read of that opposition to the work of God.

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
We've mentioned many times over the years

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,759
that God's work is continuously met

64
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,800
with opposition, with adversity.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Just because we're doing what God's called us to do

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,880
doesn't mean that it will be void of any interference

67
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,559
or any opposition.

68
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,960
In fact, often we find that that opposition comes greatly

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,000
as we're seeking to follow the Lord.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,320
The fourth chapter of the book of Acts,

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,039
we're looking this morning, beginning in verse number 23,

72
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,440
but the beginning of this chapter begins

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,839
by revealing to us how Peter and John were held in prison.

74
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,559
They were held in prison overnight

75
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,399
because of what had taken place in Acts chapter number three.

76
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,639
There was a great miracle that took place

77
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,440
with that man that was lame,

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,199
that laid at the gate beautiful, and he was healed,

79
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,199
and that gave opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel,

80
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,080
and many people trust that Christ is their savior.

81
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,520
5,000 besides the women, and you look

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
at what's taking place there,

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,240
and you look at the growth of the early church,

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,679
and you find that the religious leaders were not happy

85
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,720
with what was going on, and we find that those

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,320
that believed according to verse number four

87
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,399
the number of the men was 5,000,

88
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,479
and as we begin Acts chapter number four,

89
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,960
they were held in prison overnight,

90
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,039
they're released, and then they're interrogated,

91
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,800
and there's all sorts of questions that are asked

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,440
as to what's going on, and we find that Peter stands,

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,679
and he preaches the gospel once again,

94
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,059
and the religious leaders are not happy

95
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:12,320
with what's taking place.

96
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,360
The religious leaders, they cannot deny the miracle

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,799
of Acts chapter number three, but they desire

98
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,640
that this would spread no further.

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
So what do they do?

100
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,760
They begin to threaten the disciples.

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,040
We find that the threat is recorded for us.

102
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Look, if you will, in verse number 17 of Acts four,

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,179
as we make the, set the scene, if you will,

104
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:36,679
for the passage that we're going to look at this morning.

105
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,660
In verse 17, it says, but that it spread no further

106
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,660
among the people, let us straightly threaten them.

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,980
They speak henceforth to no man in this name,

108
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,359
and so this was this conference that they had

109
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,980
as they conferred amongst themselves,

110
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,500
according to verse number 15,

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,920
and they come up with their plan,

112
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,940
and their plan is to threaten the disciples,

113
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,339
and they call the disciples to them in verse number 18.

114
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,459
It says that they called them and commanded them

115
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,059
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

116
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,619
So this is a major problem because Jesus told them

117
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:16,179
to go and preach the gospel to every creature,

118
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:20,140
and the religious leaders are threatening the disciples,

119
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,980
and they're saying, listen, we're commanding you

120
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,940
not to teach or to even speak in the name of Jesus.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,339
It tells us that Peter responds in verse 20 and says,

122
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,959
for we cannot but speak the things

123
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,779
which we have seen and heard.

124
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,339
I'm thankful for his boldness.

125
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,859
It says in verse 21, so when they had further threatened

126
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:44,880
them, they let them go, finding nothing

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,940
how they might punish them because of the people,

128
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,179
for all men glorified God for that which was done.

129
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,940
It tells us that the man in Acts chapter number three

130
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,459
was about 40 years old on whom this miracle

131
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,140
of healing was showed.

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,820
So we find that they commanded them in verse number 18,

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,339
and Peter responds in verse 20,

134
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,100
and then they threatened them again

135
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,459
before they released them, and we come to verse number 23

136
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,260
as our passage for our study this morning.

137
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,100
The Bible says, and being let go,

138
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,420
and so these disciples are released

139
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,679
from the religious leaders.

140
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,200
They've just heard the threat.

141
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,440
They've just been commanded with regard to not speaking

142
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,320
or teaching in the name of Jesus.

143
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,839
They've already spent one night in prison,

144
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,880
according to Acts four at the beginning of the chapter

145
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,279
in verse number three.

146
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,859
We find that now they're released and being let go.

147
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,459
They went to their own company and reported all

148
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,459
that the chief priest and elders had said unto them.

149
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,600
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,600
with one accord and said, Lord, thou art God,

151
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,899
which has made heaven and earth and the sea

152
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:01,220
and all that in them is.

153
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,540
Who by the mouth of thy servant David has said,

154
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,500
why did the heathen rage?

155
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,059
And the people imagined vain things.

156
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,820
The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers

157
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,980
were gathered together against the Lord

158
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,579
and against his Christ for of a truth

159
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,660
against the holy child, Jesus, whom thou hast anointed,

160
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,140
both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles

161
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,420
and the people of Israel were gathered together

162
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,019
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel

163
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,899
determined before to be done.

164
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,899
And now, verse 29, and now, Lord, behold their threatenings.

165
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,500
And grant unto thy servants that with all boldness,

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,019
they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand

167
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,380
to heal that signs and wonders may be done

168
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,260
by the name of thy holy child, Jesus.

169
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,859
When they had prayed, place was shaken

170
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,899
where they were assembled together.

171
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,380
They were all filled with the Holy Ghost

172
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,380
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

173
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,459
Last week, the title for our message was

174
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,579
The Creator God Is My Helper, part one.

175
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,619
This morning is part two.

176
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,700
The Creator God Is My Helper.

177
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,339
The religious leaders let the disciples go as we've read

178
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,980
and we see that they come and they give this report

179
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,660
to their own company.

180
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,700
It tells us in verse 23 that they being let go,

181
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,940
they went to their own company.

182
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,820
And you can think about this reunion

183
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,540
and this gathering that took place

184
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,899
and the disciples after Acts chapter number three,

185
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,660
these Peter and John, they're imprisoned overnight

186
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,500
and they're before the religious leaders

187
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,979
and they're hearing those threats

188
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,900
and these of their own company are in a different location

189
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,820
and now Peter and John reunite with them.

190
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,919
And the Bible tells us in verse 23

191
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,239
that they reported all that the chief priests and elders

192
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,059
had said unto them.

193
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,400
So we find that as Peter and John would leave the place

194
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,940
of standing before these religious leaders

195
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,820
and hearing the threat and the command

196
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,059
and all that was contained within that conversation,

197
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,780
we find that they come and they give a report,

198
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,580
they debrief the others,

199
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,179
they let them know what the circumstances are

200
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,940
and what has transpired.

201
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,440
And we find that as we're looking at our text of scripture

202
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,900
this morning and we see this opposition,

203
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,140
we see this adversity,

204
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,260
I want you to notice first of all this morning,

205
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,859
if you are taking notes, notice how they respond.

206
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,700
Notice how they respond.

207
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,979
I believe this morning that their response is consistent

208
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,940
with the response of Hezekiah

209
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,619
that we studied last week in Isaiah 37.

210
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:35,659
And we find that what they do in verse number 24

211
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,940
is so important for us to grasp

212
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,580
and to understand this morning

213
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,700
that they hear what's taking place.

214
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,099
Peter and John heard it firsthand,

215
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:47,260
they report it to their own company,

216
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,739
they're aware of the threat of the command

217
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,859
that has been issued by the religious leaders.

218
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,260
By the way, these religious leaders had great power.

219
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,500
They had great authority.

220
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,340
They didn't have all authority.

221
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,580
They didn't have all power.

222
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,120
There is one that has all power and all authority, and his name is Jesus.

223
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,860
And that's who these disciples were serving, and that's who these disciples were seeking

224
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,020
to preach Jesus.

225
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:21,740
And we find that these that had some power and some authority would not cause the disciples

226
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,500
to cower in fear.

227
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,340
They would not cause the disciples to doubt the power and authority of their Lord and

228
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,820
Savior Jesus Christ.

229
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,740
Rather, we find that their immediate response to the situation is to go to God in prayer.

230
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,020
You know, God answers prayer.

231
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,100
It's a statement that's so easy to make, it almost can become a cliche if we're not careful.

232
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,260
But the reality is that prayer is a great privilege for the child of God, that at any

233
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,540
moment, for any reason, you have direct access to the God of the universe.

234
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,140
He told us that we're to come boldly unto the throne of grace.

235
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,900
He said to us, call, and I will answer thee.

236
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,500
And you think about the privilege of prayer, and here in the context of this great adversity

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,740
dealing with the opposition and the threats that came forth, we find that when they heard

238
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:24,780
that in verse number 24, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord.

239
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,500
They didn't get together and figure out how they were going to overcome the Sanhedrin.

240
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,460
They didn't get together and see how they could elect other people in power that might

241
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
be able to…

242
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
No, they went to God in prayer.

243
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,700
That was their immediate response, was to go to God in prayer.

244
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,580
See, prayer must be our first response.

245
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,380
Prayer cannot, it should never be our last resort.

246
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,980
We understand that God answers prayer, that God works and God moves, and we find here

247
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,500
that as they go to God in prayer, we notice, just as we did with Hezekiah, what it is that

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,740
they recognize.

249
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,780
Notice in verse number 24, the Bible says that they lifted up their voice to God with

250
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:15,620
one accord, and notice what they said, Lord, thou art God.

251
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Recognize who He is.

252
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:28,580
But then they say this, which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them

253
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,320
is.

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,420
I've said so often that the record of creation is not isolated to Genesis.

255
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,460
It seems as if the opposition would like you to think that the record of creation is only

256
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,820
found in the book of Genesis in the first few chapters, but the reality is that the

257
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,100
truth of creation is found throughout the entirety of the Word of God.

258
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,620
We find here that these disciples, they understood that the Creator God was their God.

259
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,260
They understood that He spoke and it was so.

260
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,820
That as we studied several weeks ago, as we looked at the truth of creation and how creation

261
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:16,140
reveals the greatness of God, He said, let there be light, and there was light.

262
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,700
It's amazing.

263
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:25,220
So often when we begin to think about creation and the power that's on display, the wisdom

264
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,380
that's on display with the record of creation, and we can stand and we should stand in awe

265
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,260
of who God is because He is the Creator God, but we must understand that God gave us the

266
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,740
record of creation, yes, so that we could understand the origin of man and we could

267
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,380
understand that He is the Creator, but then He ties it all together for us and lets us

268
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:53,860
understand this morning that He is our God, that He is our Helper, that when we understand

269
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,060
the power and the wisdom of creation and we understand all that was displayed through

270
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,100
creation that He is my God and He is my Helper.

271
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,260
So the disciples were facing serious opposition here.

272
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,940
Just as Hezekiah and Judah were facing serious opposition from the Assyrians, but we find

273
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,100
that in both cases, Hezekiah, and here are the disciples, they recognize that their God

274
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
is greater.

275
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,860
They understand and they recognize that He is the Creator of all things and that nothing

276
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,300
is too difficult for Him.

277
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:42,340
Thou art God which has made heaven, earth, sea, and all that is in them, all that in

278
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,980
them is.

279
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,300
Wow.

280
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,260
See, we need to be mindful of the truth that the Creator God is our Helper.

281
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,740
Sometimes we face big problems.

282
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,540
We face difficulties.

283
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,620
We've referred to, in these last two weeks, great adversity.

284
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,620
There are times in which we face great adversity, but our God is greater.

285
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Our God is able.

286
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,020
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

287
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,660
There are times, even as we mentioned in our Sunday school class this morning, that we

288
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,780
try to take matters into our own hands, that we try to scheme and devise and figure out

289
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,220
how we can do something instead of recognizing that the Creator God that spoke it all into

290
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,020
existence, that He's able to do far better than we are.

291
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,460
We look here at this passage of Scripture and we know how they respond, and I wonder

292
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,180
this morning in my life, and I wonder this morning in your life, how do we respond in

293
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,140
times of great adversity?

294
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,980
When we face difficulties, when we face problems, when we face that opposition, how is it that

295
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,640
we respond?

296
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,140
Do we immediately go to God in prayer?

297
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,420
Do we immediately remind ourselves that our God is the Creator?

298
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,780
See, sometimes we come to this place, and the disciples could have as well, because

299
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,940
this body, this religious body that they had just stood before, this Sanhedrin, these men

300
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
had great power.

301
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:20,500
The same men that delivered Jesus to Pilate to be crucified had great power.

302
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,900
They were the ones that imprisoned Peter and John the night before.

303
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
They had power.

304
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,860
And sometimes today we look at certain authorities and think, look at the authority or the power

305
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:40,260
that they have, and fail to recognize and remember that our God has all power.

306
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,040
He has all power.

307
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,380
And by the way, just as Jesus said to Pilate, remember what Pilate said, I have the power

308
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
to release you?

309
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,060
And Jesus said, listen, you need to understand something, Pilate, he didn't say it that way.

310
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,340
The only power you have, the power that I let you have.

311
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,620
And those that are in places of power are there because God has allowed them.

312
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:13,260
And by the way, that means if you like the person in power or not, amen?

313
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Because God is sovereign.

314
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,720
You know, sometimes the leadership that a nation has is judgment upon that nation.

315
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,040
You can't just think, oh, the leader that I like is there because God put him there.

316
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,320
No, no.

317
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,120
People are in power because God's allowed them to be in power.

318
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,600
And we find, though, that their power is limited while His power is unlimited.

319
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
He's the Creator God.

320
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:49,780
And that's the response of these disciples and how the truth of who God is influenced

321
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,580
the manner in which they responded to their adversity.

322
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,260
That's why it's so important to be in this book.

323
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,620
That's why it's so important for us to understand who God is.

324
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,260
And we find that we know God through His Word.

325
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,940
God has revealed Himself to us through the pages of this book.

326
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,260
We could sit here this morning and we could take testimonies this morning.

327
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,660
We could have every single person that's here this morning stand and give testimony.

328
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,700
Why do you say that God is great?

329
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,580
Why do you think God is great?

330
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,660
And everything that we could say because of His great mercy, because of His great love,

331
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,300
because of His great power, because He delivered here, because He did this, all that we know

332
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,380
about God is found in the pages of this book.

333
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,860
And God gave us this book so that we would know how great He is, so that in the time

334
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,620
of adversity, in the time of difficulty, we could respond by not saying, oh, did you hear

335
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
what they said?

336
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Did you hear?

337
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Did you hear?

338
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Do you know who my God is?

339
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Do you know what He's capable of doing?

340
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:04,720
Remember thinking about this, kids at the playground have conversations occasionally

341
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,059
about how their dad is stronger or better than your dad.

342
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:12,059
They have those kind of conversations.

343
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,900
You know what the Bible tells us?

344
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,020
Our rock is not like their rock.

345
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,580
Who's it referring to?

346
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Our God.

347
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,780
And I'm so thankful this morning that our God is greater and we find that they respond

348
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
properly.

349
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:38,100
And for us this morning, how we respond to great adversity really reveals what we know

350
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
and believe about God.

351
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:50,300
When we face great opposition, we face great difficulty in opposition, how we respond reveals

352
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,960
in great measure what we know and believe to be true of God.

353
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,340
We find how they respond, but then I want you to note in our text.

354
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,580
of Scripture, what they requested.

355
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:12,380
I want you to notice, they pray, and in verses 25 through 27, they speak about the truth

356
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,260
that had been revealed in the Old Testament, reference to Psalm 2, with regard to the heathen

357
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,620
raging and the kings of the earth standing against the Lord, and so on and so forth.

358
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,260
And you find in verse 27 and 28, speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ and how He would

359
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,460
He was, of course, determined to go to the cross of Calvary.

360
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,860
And then we come to verse 29, and that's where we really see what it is that they requested.

361
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,940
In verse 29 and verse number 30, and when I begin to note their request, when I notice

362
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,700
that they respond by prayer, but then when I look at their prayer and examine and study

363
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,020
their prayer and zero in on what they requested, I'm impressed.

364
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm challenged by what they requested.

365
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,100
Honestly, their request in this passage of Scripture, I believe, is both commendable

366
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,340
and exemplary.

367
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,420
I don't know that I would have prayed the same thing that they prayed.

368
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,980
I'll be honest with you.

369
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,740
He's the creator God.

370
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,020
My prayer might have been like this, God deal with them.

371
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,340
You heard what they said, deal with them.

372
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,900
That's not what they prayed.

373
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,740
It says this in verse 29, and now, Lord, behold their threatenings.

374
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,940
Do you remember Hezekiah, what he did?

375
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:42,260
He took that letter from Rabshakeh, went into the house of the Lord, and he laid it out

376
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,540
before the Lord.

377
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:51,740
And here the disciples, they say, Lord, you've heard, behold, their threatenings.

378
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:01,900
But notice what they request, and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they

379
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,740
may speak thy word.

380
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,620
Wow, that is commendable, that is exemplary.

381
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:19,500
See, they prayed that God would give them boldness in the face of adversity.

382
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,740
They did not pray that God would eliminate the adversity.

383
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:31,140
They prayed that though the adversity is there, God would give us boldness.

384
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,420
I want you to recall with me that James and John, not too long before this particular

385
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,780
account, desired to call fire from heaven like Elijah did.

386
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,500
Turn back, hold your place here in action, turn back to the book of Luke, if you will.

387
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:54,460
In chapter number 9, I want to read this passage of Scripture to you here in Luke 9,

388
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,740
because this did not take place that long before the text of Scripture in which we're

389
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,860
reading this morning.

390
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,940
In Acts chapter number 4, they say, Lord, behold their threatenings, but God, our request

391
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,280
is that you'd give us boldness to speak thy word.

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,260
In Luke chapter number 9, in verse 51, the Bible says, and it came to pass, when the

393
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,860
time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to

394
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,060
Jerusalem and sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of

395
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,660
the Samaritans to make ready for him, and they did not receive him, because his face

396
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,700
was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

397
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:39,460
And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command

398
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,660
fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?

399
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:51,460
Can you imagine referring back to Elijah back in 2 Kings chapter number 1?

400
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Did that happen?

401
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Sure it did.

402
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,020
You remember the final servant that came?

403
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,280
He understood the first two companies, man, they got consumed with fire, so he approached

404
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,220
Elijah differently than the first two did.

405
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,460
But we come now and we find that James and John here in verse number 54, they say to

406
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,300
the Lord, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume

407
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,460
them, even as Elijah did?

408
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,060
But he turned and rebuked them and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

409
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,140
Notice what he says, for the Son of Man has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save

410
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,620
them.

411
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:38,820
They went to another village to save them, to save them.

412
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,300
How would they be saved?

413
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
The preaching of the gospel.

414
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,900
How is anyone saved?

415
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,660
Through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

416
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,180
There's only one way to be saved, it's the Bible way.

417
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,340
Jesus is the only way.

418
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,420
No other way, no other way.

419
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,900
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

420
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,140
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

421
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,780
Peter had just proclaimed in this same very passage in Acts chapter number 4, neither

422
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,620
is there salvation any other.

423
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,700
Only in the name of Jesus, he says, notice in verse number 12, neither is there salvation

424
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,100
any other.

425
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:19,940
For there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

426
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,540
So Peter understood the gospel had to go forward.

427
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:32,020
He understood that there were some people, even within that group of that religious crowd,

428
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,820
that needed to be saved.

429
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,460
They needed to hear the gospel.

430
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,220
Those that were opposing, those that were threatening, that were commanding do not teach

431
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,700
or preach in the name of Jesus, Peter and John and the disciples and those that were

432
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,460
gathered together, they understood that they had been commissioned to preach the gospel

433
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,980
and that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

434
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,120
And so when they pray, when they make their requests, listen, they respond by prayer.

435
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,900
They understand that God is the creator and that he is their helper and they recognize

436
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,340
this great truth and they say, God, would you give us boldness in the midst of this

437
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
adversity?

438
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,340
Isn't that commendable?

439
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
Exemplary.

440
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:29,660
In the midst of this time of threats, God, we need boldness.

441
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,000
It says in verse 30, by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may

442
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,380
be done by the name of thy holy child, Jesus.

443
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,900
We've been studying the book of Acts in our adult Sunday school class or the family Sunday

444
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,940
school class, excuse me.

445
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,780
We'd studied the miracles of Christ for a lengthy period of time through the gospels.

446
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,380
As we came to a conclusion of that particular study, we dealt with the fact of what Mark

447
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,700
16 and verse 20 says, that they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working

448
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:11,300
with them and confirming the word with signs of following, amen.

449
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Here they're praying in that same understanding that God would grant them boldness.

450
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,260
You know, God is able to give you boldness in the midst of adversity, in the midst of

451
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,860
opposition, in the midst of all that's taking place in our lives and our world.

452
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,300
As we look at the disciples here in Acts chapter 4 and we see their response to those

453
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,500
that were opposing the message, you know there are people that are opposing the message still

454
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
today.

455
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
You understand that.

456
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,820
There are all sorts of things that are going on in our world today.

457
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,300
It seems like there's not a day that goes by in which you're not finding or hearing

458
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,200
about how there's someone in power, some place of authority where they're trying to silence

459
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,260
the people of God.

460
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,980
We need boldness to preach the gospel.

461
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,780
See because the Lord has come to save people.

462
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,380
And as we understand that salvation is only through the Lord Jesus Christ, there's only

463
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,660
one way to be saved.

464
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,940
As I mentioned a few moments ago, we understand that what they must hear is the gospel of

465
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,260
Jesus Christ.

466
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,300
The Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,940
That's a wonderful promise of God's word in Romans 10 and verse 13.

468
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,940
But the Bible continues and says, how then shall they call on him in whom they have not

469
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,380
believed?

470
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,620
They're not going to call on him if they don't believe him.

471
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:38,700
And then it says, how shall they believe in him whom they've not heard?

472
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,140
How shall they hear without a preacher?

473
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,620
That's what the Bible says.

474
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,540
How shall they preach except they be sent as it is written, how beautiful are the feet

475
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,980
of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things, but they've

476
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,620
not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

477
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,460
So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.

478
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,700
If you take that passage of scripture in Romans 10 and verse 13 through 17, we understand

479
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,220
the great importance that is before us of being able to preach the word of God with

480
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,020
boldness, to preach the gospel.

481
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,940
The world in which we're living, they need to be saved.

482
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
The answer is Jesus.

483
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,660
But in order for them to be saved, they need to have some of us that have some boldness.

484
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,860
That boldness needs to come from the Lord Jesus Christ.

485
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,900
Listen, I'm not going to be bold in my own power.

486
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,780
I'm not, neither are you.

487
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,140
We have the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

488
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,380
We notice how they responded.

489
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,500
How do we respond in times of great adversity?

490
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,100
Do we remember that God is the creator, that He's our helper?

491
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,660
To respond in faith, believing that He is able.

492
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,420
What is our request?

493
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:10,380
request. The request of the disciples is not to eliminate the opposition. Sometimes we

494
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:20,340
think that'd be great, but the request of the disciples is to empower His people, that

495
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:30,420
we may speak Thy word. How with boldness. Notice, finally this morning, what they received.

496
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:38,020
In verse 31, we read the response to the prayer that was prayed by these that were gathered

497
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,660
together. And the Bible tells us when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they

498
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,780
were assembled together. It tells us that they were filled with the Holy Ghost. And

499
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:58,860
then notice the end of verse 31, and they spake the word of God with boldness. Wow.

500
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,900
What a scene. What a blessing. Their desire, as it's reported through the record of the

501
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,380
prayer that they offered to the Creator God, was that they would have boldness to speak

502
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,420
the word of God. And we find that God answered the prayer and God empowered them for the

503
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:24,620
task. I'm so thankful that God still today will empower us for the task that is before

504
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:36,100
us. See, so often we just forget that we're His representatives. Sometimes our identity

505
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:42,900
is kind of skewed because the highest part of our identity is that I'm a follower of

506
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:50,300
Jesus Christ. And when I understand that I'm His representative, when I understand as Paul

507
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:56,220
would say in Galatians, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but

508
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,340
Christ liveth in me. The life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son

509
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,820
of God who loved me and gave Himself for me. Begin to understand living that crucified

510
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:14,900
life and understanding that, listen, I'm just His representative. I'm just here to go in

511
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:22,260
the power of the Holy Spirit of God and just speak the word of God with boldness. Not worried

512
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:29,180
about what somebody thinks about me. Sometimes that really is a hindrance in our lives. What

513
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,020
are they going to think about me? They're going to think I'm crazy. They probably already

514
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:42,940
do. But seriously, sometimes we get so caught up in what somebody's going to think about

515
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:52,780
me or how they're going to respond to me that we fail to recognize who we really are. Notice

516
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:03,860
what Peter had said previously to these religious leaders. In verse number 20, for we cannot

517
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:17,380
but speak the things which we have seen and heard. You know that word, cannot. It's as

518
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:25,300
if it's just oozing out of them and they can't help it. Does that make sense? It's

519
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:37,260
the overflow. And we find that the disciples here, they're saying, God, we need Your power

520
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:45,260
in order to fulfill the task that You have given us. This morning, we need God's power.

521
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:51,020
So many people today talking about becoming a 21st century church. I understand we live

522
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,020
in an advanced age and we live in a time of great advancements with technology and all

523
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,740
sorts of things. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm glad that we have electricity and heat

524
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,020
and all that stuff today. I'm thankful for that. But really, we talk about doing the

525
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:17,340
work of God, we need to become a first century church. Fully relying upon the Lord. Understanding

526
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,940
the commands that He has given us to go and to preach the gospel to every creature and

527
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:30,180
that we must go in His power and I must have His boldness. God, help me to understand why

528
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:37,460
You've placed me here. Why have You given me the sphere of influence that You have?

529
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:45,820
It's to be Your representative, to be Your ambassador, to be the light in this dark world.

530
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,540
And the disciples, they got it. They didn't pray for the opposition to be removed. They

531
00:34:52,540 --> 00:35:00,620
prayed for boldness in the midst of adversity. Last week, when we looked at Hezekiah, Judah,

532
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:07,500
the nation in which he was ruling and reigning as king over, they're faced with great adversity.

533
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:14,660
Sennacherib and Rabshakem, the Assyrians. You know, God delivered them from the Assyrians.

534
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:23,620
An angel of the Lord came out, we read it last week, and 185,000 were slain. One night.

535
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,780
God delivered them from the Assyrians. This week, as we look at the disciples, God delivered

536
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,380
them through the opposition. By the way, the opposition didn't stop at the end of Acts

537
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:44,420
chapter 4. You continue to read, the opposition just intensified. They call them in Acts chapter

538
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,700
5, and they're like, did not we command you? Almost as if to say, did you not understand

539
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:59,140
what we said? Were we not clear? And yet, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

540
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,020
That's what they say in Acts chapter 5. Peter, in that passage, he says, we ought to obey

541
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:14,620
God rather than man. In that passage, they were threatened some more, and they were beaten,

542
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:21,740
and they left rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His namesake.

543
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:29,460
Last week, the enemy was eliminated. 185,000 killed, Sennacherib goes back, his own sons

544
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:38,660
kill him. We read it. This week, however, the opposition remains. But God's people

545
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:45,340
are empowered. God's people are empowered to fulfill the task. We've often referenced

546
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,060
Psalm 121, verses 1 and 2, where the psalmist says, I will lift up my eyes into the hills.

547
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:59,140
From whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

548
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Last week with Hezekiah, he faced great adversity, but he understood that the Creator God was

549
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:15,580
his helper. This week, we look at the disciples. They face opposition, adversity, threats,

550
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:22,580
commands, but they understood that the Creator God is their helper. And I want you to notice

551
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:30,100
what the psalmist says in Psalm 146. Look over and we'll finish here with this passage

552
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:43,020
of Scripture in Psalm 146. Oh, indeed, creation reveals to us the greatness of God, His great

553
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,780
power, His great wisdom. We see it throughout the pages of Scripture. You can walk out this

554
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:57,300
afternoon and you can see the beauty of creation. Look at your own body and see how God has

555
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:13,700
formed us, fashioned us, how each of our members work. Just stand in awe of our God, but never

556
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,660
forget that He's your helper. Yes, He's the Creator, but He's your helper. Notice in Psalm

557
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:28,380
146, verse number 1 says, "'Praise ye the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul! While I

558
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:35,460
live will I praise the Lord. I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. Put not

559
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:43,820
your trust in princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help.'" How often are

560
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:53,820
we guilty of verse number 3? Putting our trust in someone or something else. Sometimes

561
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:01,900
putting our trust in ourselves. I got this. I can handle this. I need to do something.

562
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:08,700
No, no. He says, "'Put not your trust in princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is little

563
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,300
help.'" No, no. He says, no help. "'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, and

564
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:25,340
that very day his thoughts perish.'" But then notice verse 5 and 6. "'Happy is he that hath

565
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:35,580
the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.'" The word happy is

566
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:46,020
often also translated as blessed. He says, listen, don't trust in these things, but happy

567
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:52,300
or blessed is the one that has as his help the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope

568
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,740
is in the Lord his God. Notice verse number 6, "'Which made heaven and earth, the sea,

569
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,460
and all that therein is.'"

570
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,560
verse, which keepeth truth forever."

571
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:14,040
Did you notice the words of verse number 6, which made heaven and earth, the sea, and

572
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,600
all that therein is?

573
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:24,000
Does that not sound awfully familiar to exactly what the disciples prayed in Acts chapter

574
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,280
number 4?

575
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,200
Did they have the book of Psalms?

576
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640
Absolutely.

577
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,280
They had the book of Psalms.

578
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,960
They did not have the whole Bible as we have the whole Bible today.

579
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,000
But in Acts chapter number 4, when they went to God in prayer, they said, Thou art God

580
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,440
which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.

581
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,600
He is the man.

582
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,560
Blessed is the man, or is he, that hath the God of Jacob for his help.

583
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:05,840
Listen, this morning, we're blessed because the Creator God is our helper.

584
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,720
And we must never forget that.

585
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,960
Listen, I'm so thankful that He's the Creator, that He's given us the truth with regard to

586
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,400
the origin of man and the universe and all of those things, and He's told us how He did

587
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
it.

588
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,040
It's amazing when you think about creation, but how does it affect me personally in my

589
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,160
everyday life?

590
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,400
The Creator God is my helper.

591
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,680
The Creator God is your helper.

592
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,760
This week you face opposition.

593
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,700
This week you face adversity.

594
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,200
This week you face a difficulty.

595
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,660
And you say, listen, my God's the Creator.

596
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,160
He spoke it all into existence.

597
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,440
He upholds it all by His power.

598
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,080
There's nothing too hard for Him.

599
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,600
And this, whatever this is, is nothing for God.

600
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,160
My God is able.

601
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,920
How do we respond in times of great adversity?

602
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,600
I hope this morning, over these last several weeks, as we've looked at the greatness of

603
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,560
God as revealed through creation, and then we apply it to our everyday lives that the

604
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,400
Creator God is my helper, I hope that as we face difficulties in life, and I know that

605
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,580
we will.

606
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,720
I know that we will.

607
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,800
Some are in the midst of great trials at this very moment, but the Creator God is your helper.

608
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,200
And that ought to cause you to rejoice greatly.

609
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,760
And you must recognize that you're happy or blessed because the God of Jacob is your helper.

610
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,760
So often we want this thing to help me, or this person to help me, or this…God is my

611
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
helper.

612
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,920
God is my helper.

613
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,400
The psalmist said, vain is the help of man.

614
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,520
So often, I need help.

615
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,680
The psalmist said, help, Lord, understanding that He is the Creator.

616
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,600
This morning, I hope that you've been encouraged by Hezekiah and by the disciples, and that

617
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,640
you, this morning, can say personally that the Creator God is my helper.

618
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
He's your helper.

619
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,240
Say, but you don't understand what I'm dealing with.

620
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,560
He spoke it all into existence.

621
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,360
You understand that?

622
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,400
He said, and it was so.

623
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,600
He made the stars also.

624
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
What a statement.

625
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,960
He spent a whole week on that.

626
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
What a statement.

627
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,720
And He's your helper.

628
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
He's my helper.

629
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Let's pray.

630
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Father, we love You.

631
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,920
We thank You for loving us.

632
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,440
We thank You for the truth of Your Word and the power of Your Word.

633
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:55,040
We pray, God, that You would help us this morning to be encouraged and to be strengthened

634
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,200
through what You have revealed to us in Your precious Word.

635
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,720
We thank You for the response of Hezekiah.

636
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,560
We thank You, God, for the response of the disciples.

637
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:14,720
Though they face great adversity, they responded in faith, they responded with understanding

638
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,160
that You are the Creator God and that You are our helper.

639
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,880
I pray, Father, that You would help each and every one of us, Lord, as we have examined

640
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,760
these portions of Scripture, to be encouraged, to be strengthened.

641
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,120
Lord, help us to fully depend upon You.

642
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,760
Father, I pray that if there's one here or one that's tuned in via live stream that's

643
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,280
not sure of heaven, I pray that they'd trust Christ today.

644
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,120
They'd understand that He is the only Savior.

645
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:58,400
I pray for the one that's facing adversity, difficulty, many, Lord.

646
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,080
I pray that You'd help us, help us to have faith and confidence in knowing that the Creator

647
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,760
God is our helper.

648
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,560
We pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd move and work as only You can.

649
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,360
I pray that decisions would be made that would please me.

650
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,640
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

651
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Would you stand with me?

652
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,900
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

653
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,160
As our manner is, we'll have an opportunity for invitation, invite you to respond.

654
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,440
Maybe this morning you're dealing with some great adversity or opposition.

655
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,600
You need to come to this altar and ask God to help you.

656
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:46,080
Maybe you've been looking to other people or other sources for help.

657
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,960
Maybe you need to ask God to forgive you for that.

658
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,400
