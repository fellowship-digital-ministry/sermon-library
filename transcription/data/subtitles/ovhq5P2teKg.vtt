WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
And last week, we had the opportunity to study

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.719
in the Old Testament, we're in the book of Isaiah,

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:09.720
and we noted how Hezekiah trusted the Lord

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.359
in the midst of great adversity.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.560
And if you were here last week,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.399
we looked at that situation,

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.600
and Hezekiah believed the record of creation

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120
that God had given.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.879
He knew that God was the creator God,

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.200
and he knew that the creator God was his helper.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.040
And we mentioned last week,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.600
as we studied the passage of Scripture there in Isaiah

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.439
with regard to the time of Hezekiah's reign there

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.439
and the attack or the threat of the Assyrians,

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:41.680
we find that he responded to that great adversity

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.880
with fear, excuse me, with faith,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.720
and with dependence on God alone to help.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.479
Faith conquered his fear.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.919
No doubt, there were opportunities

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.799
for the people of God, Judah,

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.119
to have fear with regard to the threats

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.520
and all that had taken place.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.360
The Assyrians were the world power

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.000
and had conquered many a people group,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but Hezekiah was a man of faith.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.040
Hezekiah was a man that believed God,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.720
that trusted God, and he knew that God alone

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.599
was able to help.

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.480
He knew that there was nothing that he could do

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.519
and of himself.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.199
It was all through the power of God the creator

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:20.519
that was his helper.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:22.720
Judah, of course, as we finished up last week,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.559
was miraculously delivered,

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.080
and the Assyrians were defeated.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.959
This morning, as we look here in Acts chapter number four,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.599
I wanna look at what takes place here with the disciples.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.879
We understand that at this particular time in history,

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:39.800
as we look at this account in Acts chapter number four,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.080
that the Lord Jesus Christ had lived

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.959
his perfect, sinless life.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.959
The record of the life of Christ

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.160
is provided through the gospels.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.319
We find that he, of course, had gone

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.080
to the cross of Calvary.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.160
He had bled and died.

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:55.919
He had been buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.879
and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.080
We find that the book of Acts records for us

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.839
in the first chapter his ascension to heaven,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:05.160
and before he ascended to heaven,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.680
he gave instruction to his disciples,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.679
to those that would carry on the work of the Lord

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.039
with regard to what we refer to as the Great Commission.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.160
That work, as the disciples were seeking to fulfill

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.360
the work that God had given them to do,

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:28.199
was met with serious, I would say intense, opposition.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.000
We find that many times we begin to read

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.080
through the book of Acts, and as you continue

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.199
through the first several chapters of the book of Acts,

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.800
you read of that opposition to the work of God.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.360
We've mentioned many times over the years

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.759
that God's work is continuously met

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.800
with opposition, with adversity.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Just because we're doing what God's called us to do

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.880
doesn't mean that it will be void of any interference

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.559
or any opposition.

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.960
In fact, often we find that that opposition comes greatly

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.000
as we're seeking to follow the Lord.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.320
The fourth chapter of the book of Acts,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.039
we're looking this morning, beginning in verse number 23,

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.440
but the beginning of this chapter begins

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.839
by revealing to us how Peter and John were held in prison.

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.559
They were held in prison overnight

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.399
because of what had taken place in Acts chapter number three.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.639
There was a great miracle that took place

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.440
with that man that was lame,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.199
that laid at the gate beautiful, and he was healed,

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.199
and that gave opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.080
and many people trust that Christ is their savior.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.520
5,000 besides the women, and you look

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.800
at what's taking place there,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.240
and you look at the growth of the early church,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.679
and you find that the religious leaders were not happy

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.720
with what was going on, and we find that those

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.320
that believed according to verse number four

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.399
the number of the men was 5,000,

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.479
and as we begin Acts chapter number four,

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.960
they were held in prison overnight,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.039
they're released, and then they're interrogated,

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.800
and there's all sorts of questions that are asked

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.440
as to what's going on, and we find that Peter stands,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.679
and he preaches the gospel once again,

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.059
and the religious leaders are not happy

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.320
with what's taking place.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.360
The religious leaders, they cannot deny the miracle

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.799
of Acts chapter number three, but they desire

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.640
that this would spread no further.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.480
So what do they do?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.760
They begin to threaten the disciples.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.040
We find that the threat is recorded for us.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.160
Look, if you will, in verse number 17 of Acts four,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.179
as we make the, set the scene, if you will,

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.679
for the passage that we're going to look at this morning.

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:39.660
In verse 17, it says, but that it spread no further

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.660
among the people, let us straightly threaten them.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.980
They speak henceforth to no man in this name,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.359
and so this was this conference that they had

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.980
as they conferred amongst themselves,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.500
according to verse number 15,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.920
and they come up with their plan,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.940
and their plan is to threaten the disciples,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.339
and they call the disciples to them in verse number 18.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.459
It says that they called them and commanded them

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:11.059
not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.619
So this is a major problem because Jesus told them

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.179
to go and preach the gospel to every creature,

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.140
and the religious leaders are threatening the disciples,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.980
and they're saying, listen, we're commanding you

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.940
not to teach or to even speak in the name of Jesus.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.339
It tells us that Peter responds in verse 20 and says,

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.959
for we cannot but speak the things

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.779
which we have seen and heard.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.339
I'm thankful for his boldness.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.859
It says in verse 21, so when they had further threatened

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.880
them, they let them go, finding nothing

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.940
how they might punish them because of the people,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.179
for all men glorified God for that which was done.

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:52.940
It tells us that the man in Acts chapter number three

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.459
was about 40 years old on whom this miracle

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.140
of healing was showed.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.820
So we find that they commanded them in verse number 18,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.339
and Peter responds in verse 20,

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.100
and then they threatened them again

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.459
before they released them, and we come to verse number 23

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:10.260
as our passage for our study this morning.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.100
The Bible says, and being let go,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.420
and so these disciples are released

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.679
from the religious leaders.

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.200
They've just heard the threat.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.440
They've just been commanded with regard to not speaking

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.320
or teaching in the name of Jesus.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.839
They've already spent one night in prison,

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.880
according to Acts four at the beginning of the chapter

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.279
in verse number three.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.859
We find that now they're released and being let go.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:36.459
They went to their own company and reported all

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.459
that the chief priest and elders had said unto them.

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:45.600
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600
with one accord and said, Lord, thou art God,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.899
which has made heaven and earth and the sea

00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:01.220
and all that in them is.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.540
Who by the mouth of thy servant David has said,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.500
why did the heathen rage?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.059
And the people imagined vain things.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.820
The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.980
were gathered together against the Lord

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.579
and against his Christ for of a truth

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:19.660
against the holy child, Jesus, whom thou hast anointed,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.140
both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.420
and the people of Israel were gathered together

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.019
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:28.899
determined before to be done.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:33.899
And now, verse 29, and now, Lord, behold their threatenings.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.500
And grant unto thy servants that with all boldness,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.019
they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.380
to heal that signs and wonders may be done

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.260
by the name of thy holy child, Jesus.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.859
When they had prayed, place was shaken

00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:53.899
where they were assembled together.

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:55.380
They were all filled with the Holy Ghost

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.380
and they spake the word of God with boldness.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.459
Last week, the title for our message was

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:04.579
The Creator God Is My Helper, part one.

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:06.619
This morning is part two.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:09.700
The Creator God Is My Helper.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.339
The religious leaders let the disciples go as we've read

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:16.980
and we see that they come and they give this report

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.660
to their own company.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.700
It tells us in verse 23 that they being let go,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.940
they went to their own company.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.820
And you can think about this reunion

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.540
and this gathering that took place

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.899
and the disciples after Acts chapter number three,

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:31.660
these Peter and John, they're imprisoned overnight

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.500
and they're before the religious leaders

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.979
and they're hearing those threats

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:39.900
and these of their own company are in a different location

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.820
and now Peter and John reunite with them.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.919
And the Bible tells us in verse 23

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.239
that they reported all that the chief priests and elders

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:51.059
had said unto them.

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:54.400
So we find that as Peter and John would leave the place

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.940
of standing before these religious leaders

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.820
and hearing the threat and the command

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.059
and all that was contained within that conversation,

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:04.780
we find that they come and they give a report,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.580
they debrief the others,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.179
they let them know what the circumstances are

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:10.940
and what has transpired.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.440
And we find that as we're looking at our text of scripture

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.900
this morning and we see this opposition,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.140
we see this adversity,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.260
I want you to notice first of all this morning,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.859
if you are taking notes, notice how they respond.

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:24.700
Notice how they respond.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.979
I believe this morning that their response is consistent

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:29.940
with the response of Hezekiah

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.619
that we studied last week in Isaiah 37.

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:35.659
And we find that what they do in verse number 24

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:38.940
is so important for us to grasp

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.580
and to understand this morning

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.700
that they hear what's taking place.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.099
Peter and John heard it firsthand,

00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:47.260
they report it to their own company,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.739
they're aware of the threat of the command

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:51.859
that has been issued by the religious leaders.

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:55.260
By the way, these religious leaders had great power.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.500
They had great authority.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.340
They didn't have all authority.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.580
They didn't have all power.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.120
There is one that has all power and all authority, and his name is Jesus.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.860
And that's who these disciples were serving, and that's who these disciples were seeking

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.020
to preach Jesus.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:21.740
And we find that these that had some power and some authority would not cause the disciples

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.500
to cower in fear.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.340
They would not cause the disciples to doubt the power and authority of their Lord and

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.820
Savior Jesus Christ.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:36.740
Rather, we find that their immediate response to the situation is to go to God in prayer.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.020
You know, God answers prayer.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:45.100
It's a statement that's so easy to make, it almost can become a cliche if we're not careful.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.260
But the reality is that prayer is a great privilege for the child of God, that at any

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.540
moment, for any reason, you have direct access to the God of the universe.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.140
He told us that we're to come boldly unto the throne of grace.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.900
He said to us, call, and I will answer thee.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:08.500
And you think about the privilege of prayer, and here in the context of this great adversity

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.740
dealing with the opposition and the threats that came forth, we find that when they heard

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:24.780
that in verse number 24, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.500
They didn't get together and figure out how they were going to overcome the Sanhedrin.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.460
They didn't get together and see how they could elect other people in power that might

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.460
be able to…

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.460
No, they went to God in prayer.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.700
That was their immediate response, was to go to God in prayer.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.580
See, prayer must be our first response.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.380
Prayer cannot, it should never be our last resort.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.980
We understand that God answers prayer, that God works and God moves, and we find here

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:01.500
that as they go to God in prayer, we notice, just as we did with Hezekiah, what it is that

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.740
they recognize.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.780
Notice in verse number 24, the Bible says that they lifted up their voice to God with

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:15.620
one accord, and notice what they said, Lord, thou art God.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.620
Recognize who He is.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:28.580
But then they say this, which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.320
is.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:38.420
I've said so often that the record of creation is not isolated to Genesis.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:44.460
It seems as if the opposition would like you to think that the record of creation is only

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.820
found in the book of Genesis in the first few chapters, but the reality is that the

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.100
truth of creation is found throughout the entirety of the Word of God.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:59.620
We find here that these disciples, they understood that the Creator God was their God.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.260
They understood that He spoke and it was so.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.820
That as we studied several weeks ago, as we looked at the truth of creation and how creation

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:16.140
reveals the greatness of God, He said, let there be light, and there was light.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.700
It's amazing.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:25.220
So often when we begin to think about creation and the power that's on display, the wisdom

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:30.380
that's on display with the record of creation, and we can stand and we should stand in awe

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.260
of who God is because He is the Creator God, but we must understand that God gave us the

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.740
record of creation, yes, so that we could understand the origin of man and we could

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.380
understand that He is the Creator, but then He ties it all together for us and lets us

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:53.860
understand this morning that He is our God, that He is our Helper, that when we understand

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.060
the power and the wisdom of creation and we understand all that was displayed through

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.100
creation that He is my God and He is my Helper.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.260
So the disciples were facing serious opposition here.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.940
Just as Hezekiah and Judah were facing serious opposition from the Assyrians, but we find

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:19.100
that in both cases, Hezekiah, and here are the disciples, they recognize that their God

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.100
is greater.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.860
They understand and they recognize that He is the Creator of all things and that nothing

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.300
is too difficult for Him.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:42.340
Thou art God which has made heaven, earth, sea, and all that is in them, all that in

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.980
them is.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.300
Wow.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:52.260
See, we need to be mindful of the truth that the Creator God is our Helper.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.740
Sometimes we face big problems.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.540
We face difficulties.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.620
We've referred to, in these last two weeks, great adversity.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.620
There are times in which we face great adversity, but our God is greater.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.620
Our God is able.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:13.020
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.660
There are times, even as we mentioned in our Sunday school class this morning, that we

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.780
try to take matters into our own hands, that we try to scheme and devise and figure out

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.220
how we can do something instead of recognizing that the Creator God that spoke it all into

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:33.020
existence, that He's able to do far better than we are.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.460
We look here at this passage of Scripture and we know how they respond, and I wonder

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:43.180
this morning in my life, and I wonder this morning in your life, how do we respond in

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.140
times of great adversity?

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.980
When we face difficulties, when we face problems, when we face that opposition, how is it that

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.640
we respond?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.140
Do we immediately go to God in prayer?

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.420
Do we immediately remind ourselves that our God is the Creator?

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.780
See, sometimes we come to this place, and the disciples could have as well, because

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:10.940
this body, this religious body that they had just stood before, this Sanhedrin, these men

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.940
had great power.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:20.500
The same men that delivered Jesus to Pilate to be crucified had great power.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.900
They were the ones that imprisoned Peter and John the night before.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.660
They had power.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.860
And sometimes today we look at certain authorities and think, look at the authority or the power

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:40.260
that they have, and fail to recognize and remember that our God has all power.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.040
He has all power.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.380
And by the way, just as Jesus said to Pilate, remember what Pilate said, I have the power

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.380
to release you?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:54.060
And Jesus said, listen, you need to understand something, Pilate, he didn't say it that way.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:00.340
The only power you have, the power that I let you have.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.620
And those that are in places of power are there because God has allowed them.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:13.260
And by the way, that means if you like the person in power or not, amen?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260
Because God is sovereign.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:20.720
You know, sometimes the leadership that a nation has is judgment upon that nation.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.040
You can't just think, oh, the leader that I like is there because God put him there.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.320
No, no.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.120
People are in power because God's allowed them to be in power.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:38.600
And we find, though, that their power is limited while His power is unlimited.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.800
He's the Creator God.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:49.780
And that's the response of these disciples and how the truth of who God is influenced

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.580
the manner in which they responded to their adversity.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.260
That's why it's so important to be in this book.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.620
That's why it's so important for us to understand who God is.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.260
And we find that we know God through His Word.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.940
God has revealed Himself to us through the pages of this book.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.260
We could sit here this morning and we could take testimonies this morning.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.660
We could have every single person that's here this morning stand and give testimony.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.700
Why do you say that God is great?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.580
Why do you think God is great?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.660
And everything that we could say because of His great mercy, because of His great love,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.300
because of His great power, because He delivered here, because He did this, all that we know

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.380
about God is found in the pages of this book.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:38.860
And God gave us this book so that we would know how great He is, so that in the time

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:45.620
of adversity, in the time of difficulty, we could respond by not saying, oh, did you hear

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.620
what they said?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.620
Did you hear?

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.660
Did you hear?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.660
Do you know who my God is?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.660
Do you know what He's capable of doing?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:19:04.720
Remember thinking about this, kids at the playground have conversations occasionally

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:11.059
about how their dad is stronger or better than your dad.

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:12.059
They have those kind of conversations.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:14.900
You know what the Bible tells us?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.020
Our rock is not like their rock.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.580
Who's it referring to?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.580
Our God.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.780
And I'm so thankful this morning that our God is greater and we find that they respond

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780
properly.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:38.100
And for us this morning, how we respond to great adversity really reveals what we know

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.500
and believe about God.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:50.300
When we face great opposition, we face great difficulty in opposition, how we respond reveals

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:56.960
in great measure what we know and believe to be true of God.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.340
We find how they respond, but then I want you to note in our text.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.580
of Scripture, what they requested.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:12.380
I want you to notice, they pray, and in verses 25 through 27, they speak about the truth

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:18.260
that had been revealed in the Old Testament, reference to Psalm 2, with regard to the heathen

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.620
raging and the kings of the earth standing against the Lord, and so on and so forth.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:29.260
And you find in verse 27 and 28, speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ and how He would

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.460
He was, of course, determined to go to the cross of Calvary.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.860
And then we come to verse 29, and that's where we really see what it is that they requested.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.940
In verse 29 and verse number 30, and when I begin to note their request, when I notice

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.700
that they respond by prayer, but then when I look at their prayer and examine and study

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:54.020
their prayer and zero in on what they requested, I'm impressed.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.900
I'm challenged by what they requested.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:05.100
Honestly, their request in this passage of Scripture, I believe, is both commendable

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.340
and exemplary.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.420
I don't know that I would have prayed the same thing that they prayed.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.980
I'll be honest with you.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.740
He's the creator God.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.020
My prayer might have been like this, God deal with them.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.340
You heard what they said, deal with them.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.900
That's not what they prayed.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.740
It says this in verse 29, and now, Lord, behold their threatenings.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.940
Do you remember Hezekiah, what he did?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:42.260
He took that letter from Rabshakeh, went into the house of the Lord, and he laid it out

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.540
before the Lord.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:51.740
And here the disciples, they say, Lord, you've heard, behold, their threatenings.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:22:01.900
But notice what they request, and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.740
may speak thy word.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.620
Wow, that is commendable, that is exemplary.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:19.500
See, they prayed that God would give them boldness in the face of adversity.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.740
They did not pray that God would eliminate the adversity.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:31.140
They prayed that though the adversity is there, God would give us boldness.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:38.420
I want you to recall with me that James and John, not too long before this particular

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.780
account, desired to call fire from heaven like Elijah did.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.500
Turn back, hold your place here in action, turn back to the book of Luke, if you will.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:54.460
In chapter number 9, I want to read this passage of Scripture to you here in Luke 9,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.740
because this did not take place that long before the text of Scripture in which we're

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.860
reading this morning.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:08.940
In Acts chapter number 4, they say, Lord, behold their threatenings, but God, our request

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.280
is that you'd give us boldness to speak thy word.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.260
In Luke chapter number 9, in verse 51, the Bible says, and it came to pass, when the

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.860
time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.060
Jerusalem and sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.660
the Samaritans to make ready for him, and they did not receive him, because his face

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.700
was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:39.460
And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.660
fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.460
Can you imagine referring back to Elijah back in 2 Kings chapter number 1?

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460
Did that happen?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.460
Sure it did.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.020
You remember the final servant that came?

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.280
He understood the first two companies, man, they got consumed with fire, so he approached

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.220
Elijah differently than the first two did.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:12.460
But we come now and we find that James and John here in verse number 54, they say to

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.300
the Lord, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.460
them, even as Elijah did?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.060
But he turned and rebuked them and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:29.140
Notice what he says, for the Son of Man has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.620
them.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:38.820
They went to another village to save them, to save them.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.300
How would they be saved?

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.300
The preaching of the gospel.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.900
How is anyone saved?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.660
Through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.180
There's only one way to be saved, it's the Bible way.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.340
Jesus is the only way.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.420
No other way, no other way.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.900
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.140
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.780
Peter had just proclaimed in this same very passage in Acts chapter number 4, neither

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.620
is there salvation any other.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.700
Only in the name of Jesus, he says, notice in verse number 12, neither is there salvation

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.100
any other.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:19.940
For there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.540
So Peter understood the gospel had to go forward.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:32.020
He understood that there were some people, even within that group of that religious crowd,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.820
that needed to be saved.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.460
They needed to hear the gospel.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.220
Those that were opposing, those that were threatening, that were commanding do not teach

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:46.700
or preach in the name of Jesus, Peter and John and the disciples and those that were

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.460
gathered together, they understood that they had been commissioned to preach the gospel

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.980
and that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.120
And so when they pray, when they make their requests, listen, they respond by prayer.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.900
They understand that God is the creator and that he is their helper and they recognize

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:10.340
this great truth and they say, God, would you give us boldness in the midst of this

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.340
adversity?

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.340
Isn't that commendable?

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.340
Exemplary.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:29.660
In the midst of this time of threats, God, we need boldness.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:35.000
It says in verse 30, by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.380
be done by the name of thy holy child, Jesus.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.900
We've been studying the book of Acts in our adult Sunday school class or the family Sunday

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.940
school class, excuse me.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:53.780
We'd studied the miracles of Christ for a lengthy period of time through the gospels.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:59.380
As we came to a conclusion of that particular study, we dealt with the fact of what Mark

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.700
16 and verse 20 says, that they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:11.300
with them and confirming the word with signs of following, amen.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:17.300
Here they're praying in that same understanding that God would grant them boldness.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.260
You know, God is able to give you boldness in the midst of adversity, in the midst of

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.860
opposition, in the midst of all that's taking place in our lives and our world.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.300
As we look at the disciples here in Acts chapter 4 and we see their response to those

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.500
that were opposing the message, you know there are people that are opposing the message still

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.500
today.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
You understand that.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.820
There are all sorts of things that are going on in our world today.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.300
It seems like there's not a day that goes by in which you're not finding or hearing

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:52.200
about how there's someone in power, some place of authority where they're trying to silence

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.260
the people of God.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.980
We need boldness to preach the gospel.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.780
See because the Lord has come to save people.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.380
And as we understand that salvation is only through the Lord Jesus Christ, there's only

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.660
one way to be saved.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.940
As I mentioned a few moments ago, we understand that what they must hear is the gospel of

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.260
Jesus Christ.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.300
The Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.940
That's a wonderful promise of God's word in Romans 10 and verse 13.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.940
But the Bible continues and says, how then shall they call on him in whom they have not

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.380
believed?

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.620
They're not going to call on him if they don't believe him.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.700
And then it says, how shall they believe in him whom they've not heard?

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.140
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.620
That's what the Bible says.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.540
How shall they preach except they be sent as it is written, how beautiful are the feet

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.980
of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things, but they've

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.620
not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.460
So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:08.700
If you take that passage of scripture in Romans 10 and verse 13 through 17, we understand

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.220
the great importance that is before us of being able to preach the word of God with

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.020
boldness, to preach the gospel.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.940
The world in which we're living, they need to be saved.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.940
The answer is Jesus.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:30.660
But in order for them to be saved, they need to have some of us that have some boldness.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.860
That boldness needs to come from the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.900
Listen, I'm not going to be bold in my own power.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.780
I'm not, neither are you.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.140
We have the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.380
We notice how they responded.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.500
How do we respond in times of great adversity?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.100
Do we remember that God is the creator, that He's our helper?

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.660
To respond in faith, believing that He is able.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.420
What is our request?

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:10.380
request. The request of the disciples is not to eliminate the opposition. Sometimes we

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:20.340
think that'd be great, but the request of the disciples is to empower His people, that

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:30.420
we may speak Thy word. How with boldness. Notice, finally this morning, what they received.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:38.020
In verse 31, we read the response to the prayer that was prayed by these that were gathered

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.660
together. And the Bible tells us when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.780
were assembled together. It tells us that they were filled with the Holy Ghost. And

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:58.860
then notice the end of verse 31, and they spake the word of God with boldness. Wow.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:04.900
What a scene. What a blessing. Their desire, as it's reported through the record of the

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.380
prayer that they offered to the Creator God, was that they would have boldness to speak

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:15.420
the word of God. And we find that God answered the prayer and God empowered them for the

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:24.620
task. I'm so thankful that God still today will empower us for the task that is before

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:36.100
us. See, so often we just forget that we're His representatives. Sometimes our identity

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:42.900
is kind of skewed because the highest part of our identity is that I'm a follower of

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:50.300
Jesus Christ. And when I understand that I'm His representative, when I understand as Paul

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:56.220
would say in Galatians, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.340
Christ liveth in me. The life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:06.820
of God who loved me and gave Himself for me. Begin to understand living that crucified

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:14.900
life and understanding that, listen, I'm just His representative. I'm just here to go in

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:22.260
the power of the Holy Spirit of God and just speak the word of God with boldness. Not worried

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:29.180
about what somebody thinks about me. Sometimes that really is a hindrance in our lives. What

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.020
are they going to think about me? They're going to think I'm crazy. They probably already

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:42.940
do. But seriously, sometimes we get so caught up in what somebody's going to think about

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:52.780
me or how they're going to respond to me that we fail to recognize who we really are. Notice

00:32:52.780 --> 00:33:03.860
what Peter had said previously to these religious leaders. In verse number 20, for we cannot

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:17.380
but speak the things which we have seen and heard. You know that word, cannot. It's as

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:25.300
if it's just oozing out of them and they can't help it. Does that make sense? It's

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:37.260
the overflow. And we find that the disciples here, they're saying, God, we need Your power

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:45.260
in order to fulfill the task that You have given us. This morning, we need God's power.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:51.020
So many people today talking about becoming a 21st century church. I understand we live

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:57.020
in an advanced age and we live in a time of great advancements with technology and all

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.740
sorts of things. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm glad that we have electricity and heat

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:08.020
and all that stuff today. I'm thankful for that. But really, we talk about doing the

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:17.340
work of God, we need to become a first century church. Fully relying upon the Lord. Understanding

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.940
the commands that He has given us to go and to preach the gospel to every creature and

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:30.180
that we must go in His power and I must have His boldness. God, help me to understand why

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:37.460
You've placed me here. Why have You given me the sphere of influence that You have?

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:45.820
It's to be Your representative, to be Your ambassador, to be the light in this dark world.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:52.540
And the disciples, they got it. They didn't pray for the opposition to be removed. They

00:34:52.540 --> 00:35:00.620
prayed for boldness in the midst of adversity. Last week, when we looked at Hezekiah, Judah,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:07.500
the nation in which he was ruling and reigning as king over, they're faced with great adversity.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:14.660
Sennacherib and Rabshakem, the Assyrians. You know, God delivered them from the Assyrians.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:23.620
An angel of the Lord came out, we read it last week, and 185,000 were slain. One night.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:29.780
God delivered them from the Assyrians. This week, as we look at the disciples, God delivered

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:37.380
them through the opposition. By the way, the opposition didn't stop at the end of Acts

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:44.420
chapter 4. You continue to read, the opposition just intensified. They call them in Acts chapter

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.700
5, and they're like, did not we command you? Almost as if to say, did you not understand

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:59.140
what we said? Were we not clear? And yet, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:05.020
That's what they say in Acts chapter 5. Peter, in that passage, he says, we ought to obey

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:14.620
God rather than man. In that passage, they were threatened some more, and they were beaten,

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:21.740
and they left rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His namesake.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:29.460
Last week, the enemy was eliminated. 185,000 killed, Sennacherib goes back, his own sons

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:38.660
kill him. We read it. This week, however, the opposition remains. But God's people

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:45.340
are empowered. God's people are empowered to fulfill the task. We've often referenced

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:51.060
Psalm 121, verses 1 and 2, where the psalmist says, I will lift up my eyes into the hills.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:59.140
From whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:05.140
Last week with Hezekiah, he faced great adversity, but he understood that the Creator God was

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:15.580
his helper. This week, we look at the disciples. They face opposition, adversity, threats,

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:22.580
commands, but they understood that the Creator God is their helper. And I want you to notice

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:30.100
what the psalmist says in Psalm 146. Look over and we'll finish here with this passage

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:43.020
of Scripture in Psalm 146. Oh, indeed, creation reveals to us the greatness of God, His great

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:49.780
power, His great wisdom. We see it throughout the pages of Scripture. You can walk out this

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:57.300
afternoon and you can see the beauty of creation. Look at your own body and see how God has

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:13.700
formed us, fashioned us, how each of our members work. Just stand in awe of our God, but never

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.660
forget that He's your helper. Yes, He's the Creator, but He's your helper. Notice in Psalm

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:28.380
146, verse number 1 says, "'Praise ye the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul! While I

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:35.460
live will I praise the Lord. I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. Put not

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:43.820
your trust in princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help.'" How often are

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:53.820
we guilty of verse number 3? Putting our trust in someone or something else. Sometimes

00:38:53.820 --> 00:39:01.900
putting our trust in ourselves. I got this. I can handle this. I need to do something.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:08.700
No, no. He says, "'Put not your trust in princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is little

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:15.300
help.'" No, no. He says, no help. "'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, and

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:25.340
that very day his thoughts perish.'" But then notice verse 5 and 6. "'Happy is he that hath

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:35.580
the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.'" The word happy is

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:46.020
often also translated as blessed. He says, listen, don't trust in these things, but happy

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:52.300
or blessed is the one that has as his help the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.740
is in the Lord his God. Notice verse number 6, "'Which made heaven and earth, the sea,

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.460
and all that therein is.'"

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.560
verse, which keepeth truth forever."

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:14.040
Did you notice the words of verse number 6, which made heaven and earth, the sea, and

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.600
all that therein is?

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:24.000
Does that not sound awfully familiar to exactly what the disciples prayed in Acts chapter

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.280
number 4?

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.200
Did they have the book of Psalms?

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.640
Absolutely.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.280
They had the book of Psalms.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.960
They did not have the whole Bible as we have the whole Bible today.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.000
But in Acts chapter number 4, when they went to God in prayer, they said, Thou art God

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:51.440
which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.600
He is the man.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.560
Blessed is the man, or is he, that hath the God of Jacob for his help.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:05.840
Listen, this morning, we're blessed because the Creator God is our helper.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.720
And we must never forget that.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.960
Listen, I'm so thankful that He's the Creator, that He's given us the truth with regard to

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.400
the origin of man and the universe and all of those things, and He's told us how He did

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.400
it.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:25.040
It's amazing when you think about creation, but how does it affect me personally in my

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.160
everyday life?

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.400
The Creator God is my helper.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.680
The Creator God is your helper.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.760
This week you face opposition.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.700
This week you face adversity.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.200
This week you face a difficulty.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.660
And you say, listen, my God's the Creator.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.160
He spoke it all into existence.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.440
He upholds it all by His power.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.080
There's nothing too hard for Him.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.600
And this, whatever this is, is nothing for God.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.160
My God is able.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.920
How do we respond in times of great adversity?

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.600
I hope this morning, over these last several weeks, as we've looked at the greatness of

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.560
God as revealed through creation, and then we apply it to our everyday lives that the

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.400
Creator God is my helper, I hope that as we face difficulties in life, and I know that

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.580
we will.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.720
I know that we will.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:27.800
Some are in the midst of great trials at this very moment, but the Creator God is your helper.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.200
And that ought to cause you to rejoice greatly.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:38.760
And you must recognize that you're happy or blessed because the God of Jacob is your helper.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:45.760
So often we want this thing to help me, or this person to help me, or this…God is my

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760
helper.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.920
God is my helper.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.400
The psalmist said, vain is the help of man.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.520
So often, I need help.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:04.680
The psalmist said, help, Lord, understanding that He is the Creator.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.600
This morning, I hope that you've been encouraged by Hezekiah and by the disciples, and that

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.640
you, this morning, can say personally that the Creator God is my helper.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640
He's your helper.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.240
Say, but you don't understand what I'm dealing with.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.560
He spoke it all into existence.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.360
You understand that?

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.400
He said, and it was so.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.600
He made the stars also.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600
What a statement.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.960
He spent a whole week on that.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960
What a statement.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.720
And He's your helper.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720
He's my helper.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720
Let's pray.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720
Father, we love You.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.920
We thank You for loving us.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.440
We thank You for the truth of Your Word and the power of Your Word.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:55.040
We pray, God, that You would help us this morning to be encouraged and to be strengthened

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.200
through what You have revealed to us in Your precious Word.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.720
We thank You for the response of Hezekiah.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.560
We thank You, God, for the response of the disciples.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:14.720
Though they face great adversity, they responded in faith, they responded with understanding

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:20.160
that You are the Creator God and that You are our helper.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.880
I pray, Father, that You would help each and every one of us, Lord, as we have examined

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:31.760
these portions of Scripture, to be encouraged, to be strengthened.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.120
Lord, help us to fully depend upon You.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.760
Father, I pray that if there's one here or one that's tuned in via live stream that's

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:46.280
not sure of heaven, I pray that they'd trust Christ today.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.120
They'd understand that He is the only Savior.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:58.400
I pray for the one that's facing adversity, difficulty, many, Lord.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.080
I pray that You'd help us, help us to have faith and confidence in knowing that the Creator

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.760
God is our helper.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.560
We pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd move and work as only You can.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.360
I pray that decisions would be made that would please me.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.640
We'll thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640
Would you stand with me?

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.900
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:33.160
As our manner is, we'll have an opportunity for invitation, invite you to respond.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.440
Maybe this morning you're dealing with some great adversity or opposition.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.600
You need to come to this altar and ask God to help you.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:46.080
Maybe you've been looking to other people or other sources for help.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.960
Maybe you need to ask God to forgive you for that.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.400
Ask Him completely.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.880
The Creator God is our helper.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.680
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
