1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
A little over three months, actually, since we've been in the book of Colossians, and

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,159
I know that many of you take notes and have your notebooks, and if you want to mark down,

3
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:13,640
this is message number 10 through the book of Colossians, but message number 9 was on

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,359
March 14th.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,879
And so I don't know if you want to put a little notation maybe in your notes so that you can

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,680
be able to go back and see the continuation, if you will.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,719
But as we look at Colossians 2 this morning, we'll be looking at verses 11 through 15.

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,879
And notice what the Word of God says here, beginning in verse number 11 of Colossians

9
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,880
2.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,200
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,279
of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein

12
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:54,759
also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
from the dead.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,119
Verse 13.

15
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:04,199
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,519
with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances

17
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:18,099
that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it

18
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,360
to his cross.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,959
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing

20
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,000
over them in it.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,919
Notice the last phrase of verse number 14.

22
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:32,319
We'll use it for our title this morning.

23
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,959
Nailing it to his cross.

24
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,540
We of course sang that wonderful, familiar hymn this morning.

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,279
It is well with my soul, and that third verse speaks about my sin, O the bliss of this glorious

26
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,279
thought.

27
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:52,559
My sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to his cross, and I bear it no more.

28
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,000
Isn't that wonderful?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,879
And here we find that Paul is writing to these believers in Colossae, of course, if we could

30
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,239
take, since it's been so long since we've looked at Colossians, the book, and chapter

31
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,239
2 in particular.

32
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,600
We'll be reminded this morning by way of introduction that Colossians 2 begins with Paul expressing

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,759
his concern for the brethren.

34
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,919
In fact, he voices it this way.

35
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:20,160
He says in verse number 1 that he has this conflict.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,839
He says, I have a great conflict for you.

37
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:28,639
And we understand as we begin to study Colossians chapter number 2 and read about this conflict,

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,399
this concern that Paul had for these believers, not only here at Colossae, but also those

39
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:39,759
in the city of Laodicea, we understand that he was concerned for them because the enemy

40
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,919
was active.

41
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,119
The enemy was working and the enemy was active, and Paul has this concern for the brethren,

42
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:52,380
and that concern leads him to the next several verses by which we took two messages to study

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,279
through, verses really 4 through 10, and we dealt with the subject matter of the warning.

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:04,360
Remember that the apostle Paul, as he highlighted and explained to the believers in Colossae

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,279
what his ministry was, he said that he was ministering and he was seeking to teach every

46
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:15,559
man, but that his ministry also included warning every man.

47
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:21,360
And as we look at Colossians chapter number 2, we see that Paul is issuing these warnings,

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,360
and Paul is seeking to help the believers understand how it is that the enemy works

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,800
and how it is that we as the people of God are to combat the enemy.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,479
We find that the warning was issued, and of course it was their responsibility to take

51
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,279
heed to that which had been given.

52
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:45,380
We find that Paul would explain several things in our text that we're going to look at this

53
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,039
morning in verses 11 through 15 as to that which was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ

54
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,919
on the cross of Calvary.

55
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,399
I'm so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross, amen?

56
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm so thankful that he took my place.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,839
The plan of redemption was determined before the foundation of the world, and the price

58
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:09,080
of redemption was determined to be the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,240
And we understand that he came and he fulfilled.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,399
He said when he hung upon that cross before he gave up the ghost, it is finished.

61
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,399
And I'm so thankful that as Paul would begin to share with these believers in Colossae

62
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,720
some of that which was accomplished at Calvary, it's right after he tells them in verse number

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,640
10, and we've used it for our theme this year, ye are complete in him, complete in Christ.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,720
And some of that false teaching that was taking place there in Colossae that was prevalent

65
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,959
at this particular time would cause people to think that they needed something in addition

66
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,959
to Christ.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Yes, there are those that would give false teaching and they would say, well, Christ

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,440
plus your works, and so on and so forth.

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,859
But we find that these particular false teachers, they would speak about some level of maybe

70
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:07,359
mysticism and what have you, and the going deeper, if you will, and the way in which

71
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:12,760
some of these believers would have been influenced by this false teaching.

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,640
And Paul helps them understand, you're complete in Christ, you're complete in Christ.

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,359
Let me share with you what was accomplished at Calvary.

74
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,440
If you're taking notes this morning, notice number one with me.

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Consider what Christ did for sinners.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,399
Consider what Christ did for sinners.

77
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,679
In verses 11 through 14, the Apostle Paul will share with these believers in Colossae

78
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:38,160
what was accomplished on the cross of Calvary for sinners.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,839
By the way, all men are sinners, amen?

80
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,640
And as we begin to look at this text of Scripture, we understand that Paul is writing to the

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,720
believers in Colossae, and as he's writing to these individuals, he reminds them of

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
what they were, but then he reminds them of what they are because of what Christ accomplished

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,200
at Calvary for sinners.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,359
And as we begin to understand and unfold some of these things, again, as I mentioned a moment

85
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,959
ago, all men are sinners.

86
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:07,519
Yes, it's written to these believers in Colossae, but we understand that the truth that is contained

87
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,040
herein is truth that is applicable to every man, every human being that's ever walked

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
upon the face of the earth.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,359
We understand, even as we would look at nature, why does an apple tree produce apples?

90
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,760
Because it's an apple tree, right?

91
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,239
Pretty simple truth, pretty simple understanding, and that apple tree does not produce peaches

92
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,640
because it's an apple tree.

93
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,359
And why is it that human beings sin?

94
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,720
It's because we're sinners.

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,720
And we're sinners, and therefore we sin, and there's this huge problem.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,559
It's a condition that affects all mankind of sin.

97
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:52,359
We find that here sin would be dealt with at Calvary, and Paul is reminding them of

98
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,480
some of these things that were accomplished.

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,660
First we understand what we were.

100
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:04,200
Notice what he says here in verse number 13, and you being dead in your sins and in the

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,959
uncircumcision of your flesh.

102
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,600
Notice in verse number 14, blotting out the handwriting, but notice what it says here,

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,119
of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us.

104
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:22,720
If we could simply just highlight a couple of things with regard to the condition of

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,200
mankind, we'd understand that man is condemned already.

106
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,440
We understand that we're dead in our sins and in our transgressions.

107
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,320
We understand that we have this handwriting of ordinances that was against us, it was

108
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,880
contrary to us, and we find that as we would look at this truth of being condemned and

109
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,739
being dead in our sins, we find that we would simply be able to say this, we are guilty

110
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,480
before a holy God.

111
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
We're guilty.

112
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,839
I think about the nation of Israel, and you think about the truth of the Ten Commandments,

113
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,239
and it's interesting in Exodus 19 when Moses is confronting the children of Israel before

114
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,720
God would call him up to the mount in chapter number 20, but we find that God and Moses

115
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,040
had some interaction in chapter 19, and Moses has then some interaction with the people

116
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,480
of God, and the people say in Exodus 19, all that the Lord would command, we will do.

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,559
We find that it's in Exodus chapter number 20 that God gives those Ten Commandments.

118
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:31,239
We know that the law in its entirety is much broader than simply Ten Commandments, but

119
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:36,239
we find that they had said, whatever the Lord commands, we will do.

120
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,599
Now how did they do with that?

121
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,080
Not so well.

122
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
Why?

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,479
Because the law reveals the condition of mankind.

124
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,359
The law shows us that we're sinners.

125
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,599
The law shows us that we're condemned.

126
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:54,419
In fact, James says it this way in James 2, in verse number 10, when we think about this

127
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,799
truth with regard to the law, the Bible says, for whosoever shall keep the whole law and

128
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:07,200
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,080
We find that the Word of God would teach us about our condition, and here Paul is reminding

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,440
these believers of their condition.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,239
When the Gospel first came to them, how it was that God in His grace and His mercy brought

132
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,880
the truth to them because they were condemned already.

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,239
Remember what God says, the Lord Jesus Christ says this in John 3, after an interaction

134
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:35,520
with Nicodemus, we find in John 3, in verse number 16, a very familiar verse of Scripture

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
to us.

136
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,799
The Bible says, for God so loved the world.

137
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,640
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

138
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,640
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth

139
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,200
in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,799
Notice verse 17, for God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that

141
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,039
the world through Him might be saved.

142
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,639
He that believeth on him is not condemned,

143
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,299
but he that believeth not is condemned already,

144
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,299
because he hath not believed in the name

145
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,639
of the only begotten Son of God."

146
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,239
We are condemned already.

147
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,399
We're at enmity with God.

148
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,099
Romans 5 and verse 8 says that

149
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,939
God commendeth His love toward us

150
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,399
and that while we were yet sinners,

151
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,759
Christ died for us.

152
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,999
We find that 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21,

153
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,459
as Paul is there sharing with the believers

154
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,439
in Corinth and expressing to them

155
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,739
all that Christ did for us

156
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,639
and the plan of redemption

157
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,819
and the imputed righteousness

158
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,679
upon the child of God.

159
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,279
He says,

160
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,759
"...for He," speaking of God,

161
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,799
"...hath made Him," speaking of Jesus,

162
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,919
"...hath made Him to be sin for us,"

163
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,879
notice, "...who knew no sin,

164
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,959
that we might be made

165
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,599
the righteousness of God in Him."

166
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,879
Peter says it this way.

167
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,679
If you take and turn to 1 Peter 4,

168
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,139
notice what Peter says here

169
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,319
with regard to the work at Calvary

170
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,979
and to the work that was accomplished.

171
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:13,999
1 Peter 3

172
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,739
I want you to notice verse 18.

173
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,759
1 Peter 3 and verse 18,

174
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,559
"...for Christ also hath once suffered for sins."

175
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,399
Notice this,

176
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,439
"...the just for the unjust,

177
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,239
that He might bring us to God,

178
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,239
being put to death in the flesh,

179
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,919
but quickened by the Spirit."

180
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,319
And so we find that Paul,

181
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,439
as he begins to speak to these believers in Colossae,

182
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,079
and after he'd given them warning

183
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,119
and dealing with some of the false teaching

184
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,319
that's taking place there,

185
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,839
he's going to remind them

186
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,799
what they are in Christ.

187
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,319
And before he begins to express to them

188
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,239
what they are,

189
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,479
he reminds them of what they were.

190
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,639
That they were dead in their sins

191
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,759
and their trespasses,

192
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,679
as he says to the believers in Ephesus.

193
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,319
That they had this handwriting of ordinances

194
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:04,319
that was against us,

195
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,399
that was contrary to us.

196
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,439
Listen, we were guilty.

197
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,279
There's no way that we could ever stand

198
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,359
and say, nope, I fulfilled all of it.

199
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,919
We're guilty.

200
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,679
We're guilty.

201
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,039
As we begin to think about what we were,

202
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,319
we can rejoice greatly in what we now are.

203
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,519
And notice with me in this same passage here

204
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,279
in Colossians 2, in verse 13,

205
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,839
we've only read portions of these two verses

206
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,079
in our first aspect of this point,

207
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,239
but notice the Bible says,

208
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,359
"...and you, being dead in your sins

209
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,279
and the uncircumcision of your flesh,"

210
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,279
notice this,

211
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,239
"...hath He quickened together with Him."

212
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,719
That word quickened means to make alive.

213
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,159
And we understand the truth of the rebirth.

214
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,599
You must be born again.

215
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,319
And I'm so thankful for the truth

216
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,079
of the supernatural, the spiritual birth,

217
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,039
and the truth of being born again,

218
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,959
being redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.

219
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,239
And we find here that He says that you,

220
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,679
"...hath He quickened together with Him."

221
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,159
Then notice the final phrase of verse 13,

222
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,839
"...having forgiven you..."

223
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,199
What's that next word say?

224
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,319
Aren't you thankful for every word of God?

225
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:23,799
"...having forgiven you all trespasses."

226
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,119
Isn't it good to be forgiven?

227
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,199
I mean, honestly.

228
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,639
He didn't say He forgave you most.

229
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,039
He didn't say He forgave you some.

230
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,759
He said, "...forgiving you all trespasses."

231
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,959
Notice how He begins verse 14,

232
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,519
"...blotting out..."

233
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,759
Now notice it says,

234
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,119
"...the handwriting of ordinances

235
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,199
that was against us which was contrary to us,

236
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,999
and we understand that that handwriting

237
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,559
of ordinance was against us,

238
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,399
that we are guilty..."

239
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,119
Remember when they found the lady,

240
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,639
they said we've caught her in the very act

241
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,359
in this immorality,

242
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,599
and they were going there to accuse her

243
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,119
that they might stone her.

244
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,959
And what did Jesus do?

245
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,079
He wrote in the sand.

246
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,319
I don't know what He wrote.

247
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,799
I can only imagine what He wrote

248
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,119
were some of the sins that those very people

249
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,159
were guilty of.

250
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,359
And He says what?

251
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,199
The one that has no sin casts the first stone.

252
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,199
Amen?

253
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,119
I'm thankful that He's blotted out.

254
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,239
Listen, we're guilty.

255
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,639
The handwriting of ordinances that was against us,

256
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,999
that was contrary to us,

257
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,159
but He's blotted it out.

258
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,599
And you think about the way that He did that

259
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,879
we sang this morning.

260
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,439
Are you washed in the blood?

261
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:44,519
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb.

262
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,919
It's through the blood of Jesus Christ,

263
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,199
His death, burial, and resurrection,

264
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,079
that that handwriting of ordinances

265
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,199
that was against us,

266
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,559
that was contrary to us,

267
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,079
it's only through His blood

268
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,279
that it can be blotted out.

269
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,999
And hallelujah for that.

270
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,719
We find that He says blotting out

271
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,079
the handwriting of ordinances

272
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:03,999
that was against us

273
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,999
and really carrying with it that idea

274
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,839
of what I mentioned in the beginning of the message

275
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,839
this morning,

276
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,519
how that Jesus said it is finished.

277
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,999
It is finished.

278
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,359
If you've ever had a mortgage,

279
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,239
if you've ever had any kind of a loan,

280
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,679
and it finally comes to the end

281
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,879
of the final payment,

282
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,319
and there's something that you get,

283
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,839
this promissory note when you receive the loan,

284
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,119
and then that promissory note

285
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,719
when it's paid in full,

286
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,839
they issue paid in full.

287
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,719
It's complete.

288
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,919
It's done with.

289
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,719
And here we find that this handwriting

290
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,279
of ordinances that was against us,

291
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,519
that was contrary to us,

292
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,599
that it was blotted out.

293
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,559
Notice what He says at the end of the verse.

294
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,239
He took it out of the way.

295
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,319
Nailing it to His cross.

296
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,439
Aren't you thankful for that?

297
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,279
We begin to think about what we were.

298
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,399
That we were dead in our sins

299
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,319
and our trespasses.

300
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,399
That we were condemned.

301
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
That we were guilty.

302
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,799
But when you think about what we are,

303
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,479
thinking that we've been made alive,

304
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,519
we've been quickened together with Him.

305
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,039
We have been forgiven

306
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,279
of all of our trespasses.

307
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,119
That they've been blotted out.

308
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,759
That He's taken it out of the way.

309
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,319
Nailing it to His cross

310
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,999
that now we can stand

311
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,039
and understand that we've been redeemed.

312
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,599
That we've been reconciled to God Almighty.

313
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,999
That we have been imputed

314
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:23,879
with the very righteousness of God Almighty.

315
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,999
The Bible tells us this in the book of Romans

316
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,119
in chapter 5 and verse 1.

317
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,959
I'll give you a moment to turn there.

318
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,599
We'll look at a couple of verses here

319
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,679
in the book of Romans.

320
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,279
But notice Romans 5.

321
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,079
We referenced a moment ago verse 8.

322
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,799
But I want you to look at verse 1

323
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,319
in Romans 5.

324
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,679
The Bible says this in Romans 5 and verse 1,

325
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,759
Therefore, being justified by faith,

326
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,479
we have peace with God

327
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:57,039
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

328
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,319
The only way to be justified is by faith

329
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,079
and we understand that the only way

330
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,279
to have peace with God

331
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,959
is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

332
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,239
I'm thankful for reconciliation

333
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,199
that when we were guilty and condemned

334
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,239
and we were distant and separated

335
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,759
from God Almighty,

336
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,279
that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ,

337
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,759
reconciled us.

338
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,879
That we can enter into His very presence.

339
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:22,719
Notice chapter 8.

340
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,719
Notice what the Word of God says here

341
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,479
in Romans 8 and verse 1.

342
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,639
There is therefore now no condemnation

343
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:37,159
to them which are in Christ Jesus,

344
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,359
who walk not after the flesh,

345
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,639
but after the Spirit.

346
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,559
Isn't it wonderful to be in Christ?

347
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,999
To have understanding of what Christ did for us

348
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:45,959
at Calvary.

349
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,279
What He did for sinners.

350
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,879
The reality is that if we remove the truth

351
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:55,159
and the record of Calvary,

352
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,039
we're hopeless and helpless.

353
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,759
We are condemned.

354
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,839
But I'm thankful that Jesus did come

355
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,279
and that He did fulfill.

356
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,679
Remember, the book of Galatians tells us

357
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,439
that at the appointed time,

358
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,399
that when the fullness of time was come,

359
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,159
that God sent forth His Son.

360
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,599
And the Bible gives us very clear indication

361
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,279
as to why God sent forth His Son.

362
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,199
He sent forth His Son,

363
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,439
being made of a woman,

364
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,359
made under the law,

365
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,639
to redeem them that were under the law.

366
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,039
Why? Because we're guilty.

367
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,199
We're condemned already.

368
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:32,079
I'm thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ

369
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,199
accomplished at the cross of Calvary.

370
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,799
Notice back in Colossians 2,

371
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,679
not only do we see as we consider

372
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,639
what Christ did for sinners here at Calvary,

373
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,719
not only do we notice the phrases

374
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:45,759
that are given to us in verses 13 and 14,

375
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,119
but we're mindful of that which is given to us

376
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,519
in verses 11 and 12.

377
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,719
Notice what He says in verse 11,

378
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,959
in whom also you are circumcised

379
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:58,199
with the circumcision made without hands,

380
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,599
and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh

381
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,279
by the circumcision of Christ.

382
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,479
All of a sudden now in verse 11,

383
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,119
this subject matter of circumcision comes up,

384
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,320
but Paul begins to deal with circumcision

385
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,919
from a different perspective.

386
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,519
Jewish people, of course,

387
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,199
would have had a very clear understanding

388
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,199
of circumcision as soon as they hear

389
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,239
the word being circumcised,

390
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,839
they immediately begin thinking

391
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,279
of the token of the Abrahamic covenant,

392
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,159
the circumcision of flesh,

393
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,119
but we find that it was not the Abrahamic covenant

394
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,159
that was being dealt with,

395
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,839
it was the new covenant,

396
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
and it was the circumcision of the heart.

397
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,239
And Paul is dealing here with that truth

398
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,159
of what Christ did,

399
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,119
and you think about conversion,

400
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,159
and he says here that you're circumcised,

401
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,959
notice this, with the circumcision made without hands.

402
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,159
He's not talking about the token

403
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,919
of the Abrahamic covenant.

404
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,440
That's not in his view, in his focus,

405
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,159
he's speaking about something entirely different,

406
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:58,799
something for the child of God,

407
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,599
the one that has been born again.

408
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,599
Again, he says that you're circumcised

409
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,839
with this circumcision made without hands

410
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,919
and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh

411
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,839
by the circumcision of Christ.

412
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,999
Isn't that wonderful?

413
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,819
This new covenant that has been introduced,

414
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,479
of course, the children of Israel

415
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:20,099
in the book of Jeremiah in particular,

416
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,759
they would have knowledge of the new covenant.

417
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,259
You read the book of Hebrews as we studied last year

418
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,639
and you see references to the new covenant.

419
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,879
You find here that Paul is helping these individuals.

420
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,479
Now, you remember that there were all sorts

421
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,659
of these false teachings with regard to circumcision.

422
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,799
In fact, it was in Galatians that they said

423
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,799
unless you're circumcised, you can't be saved.

424
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,239
And really, we find that that was dealt with

425
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,799
if you go back to the book of Acts

426
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
and you read and you understand the,

427
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,719
really the council that took place there in Jerusalem.

428
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,039
It's recorded for us, you don't need to turn there,

429
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,619
but it's recorded for us in Acts chapter number 15.

430
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,699
And there were some people that were saying this,

431
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,819
except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses,

432
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,739
notice they said, ye cannot be saved.

433
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,099
And Paul says, no, no, no, that's not true.

434
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,299
That's not true.

435
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,459
And they have this whole meeting and they determine,

436
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:15,299
yes, it's not true, it's not biblically accurate.

437
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,699
And so we find that they now here in Colossae,

438
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,559
it wasn't so much that they would be saying

439
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,659
that you had to be circumcised in order to be saved,

440
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,579
but having circumcision somehow elevates your position,

441
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,019
right, it elevates your standing with God.

442
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:35,879
But Paul says, no, no, no, you're complete in Him.

443
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,819
You're complete in Him and you have received

444
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,899
this circumcision that's entirely different

445
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:44,539
to that which they would deal with in the Old Testament

446
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,259
to that which was the token of the Abrahamic covenant

447
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:50,579
because you've been circumcised with that circumcision

448
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,859
that is made without hands, the circumcision of the heart.

449
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:57,059
By the way, throughout the Old Testament,

450
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,459
was it not clearly given to the children of Israel

451
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:02,539
that God was concerned about their heart?

452
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,159
You're doing all of these outward things.

453
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,179
You followed the token, the right of circumcision,

454
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,979
if you will, and you've done these things

455
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,559
and you've followed these feasts,

456
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,819
but your heart is far from me, right?

457
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,219
There you see it all throughout the Old Testament,

458
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,459
God's concern for the heart.

459
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:22,779
In verse number 12,

460
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,619
he deals with the subject matter of baptism.

461
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,819
He says, buried with Him in baptism,

462
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,659
wherein also you're risen with Him

463
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:34,499
through the faith of the operation of God

464
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:38,019
who hath raised Him from the dead.

465
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,699
Begin to think about the truth of baptism.

466
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,019
We find not only would the mode of baptism

467
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,219
be clearly revealed here as being that of immersion,

468
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:49,539
for the Bible says that you're buried with Him in baptism

469
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,059
and then risen with Him

470
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,059
through the faith of the operation of God.

471
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,859
And we understand that baptism is an outward expression

472
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,999
of an inward experience.

473
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:01,979
We understand this morning that baptism cannot save you

474
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:05,779
the same way that circumcision cannot save you.

475
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:07,379
And there are some, unfortunately,

476
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:09,459
that have misunderstood and misapplied

477
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,899
and they believe and they teach and practice

478
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,859
this thing of infant baptism

479
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,019
and thinking that somehow,

480
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,899
just like the children of Israel,

481
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,139
on eight days they would circumcise their boys,

482
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:21,379
that if you were baptized as an infant

483
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,879
that somehow you have this entrance

484
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,419
into this covenant with God

485
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,399
and it's foreign to the Bible.

486
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,859
You can't find it anywhere

487
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,179
within the pages of Scripture of infant baptism.

488
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,179
In fact, every person that you read of being baptized

489
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:39,199
in the Word of God is somebody that is an adult

490
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,459
that's made a decision,

491
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,459
someone that is able to acknowledge

492
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,539
that they have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

493
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,939
as their personal Savior

494
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:49,519
and therefore they follow the Lord in believer's baptism.

495
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,899
We find that there are those

496
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,519
that have confused some of these things,

497
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:57,579
but Paul is helping these believers to understand,

498
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,299
again, what it was that Christ did for sinners at Calvary.

499
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,739
What was it that was accomplished at Calvary?

500
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,419
Why is it that there are so many songs

501
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,799
that we as the people of God sing about Calvary?

502
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,759
There are so many songs that contain within,

503
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,919
maybe if the title specifically doesn't deal with the cross

504
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,039
or with Calvary,

505
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,519
but the words within the songs are reminding us

506
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,359
of what Christ did at Calvary

507
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,119
and the impact that it makes for us as children of God.

508
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,799
I can only be a child of God because of Calvary.

509
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,119
Amen?

510
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:37,039
As we look at this portion of Scripture,

511
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,899
we can rejoice greatly in our standing with Christ.

512
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,599
Yes, we can be reminded of what we were,

513
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,539
but how we ought to rejoice in what we now are in Christ.

514
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,339
Number two this morning, if you're taking notes,

515
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:54,719
I want you to consider not only what Christ did for sinners,

516
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,019
but I want you to notice number two

517
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:59,639
and consider with me what Christ did to Satan.

518
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:03,999
In verse number 15, there's a clear indication

519
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,139
of how it is that Christ triumphed over Satan.

520
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,679
Now understand with me this morning

521
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,719
that the readers of this particular book,

522
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,199
when it was initially given,

523
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,439
they would have been familiar

524
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:17,079
with what they would be able to refer to as a Roman triumph.

525
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,259
They would be very familiar

526
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,919
with how the Romans would go into battle

527
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,359
and as they would be victorious

528
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,319
and as they would triumph over someone,

529
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,639
they would be understanding

530
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:27,619
of how they would come back with a parade

531
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,599
and all of the hoopla that would go with it

532
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,519
and how they would triumph over their enemies,

533
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,299
how that they would bring some enemies back with them

534
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,399
that would be shackled,

535
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:40,759
that would be behind the chariots, if you will,

536
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,079
that would be publicly shamed

537
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,479
and it would be a triumph for the Romans

538
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,239
and the particular general,

539
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,679
if you want to use that terminology,

540
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,759
that was able to be successful in battle.

541
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,519
They would have been familiar with that process.

542
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,359
They would have had an awareness

543
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,239
of that particular situation

544
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,359
and we find that I believe

545
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,959
that Paul would use that familiar event

546
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:06,439
to explain and illustrate to these believers at Colossae

547
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,759
and for us this morning

548
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,139
what it was that Christ did to Satan at Calvary.

549
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,559
The Bible says this in verse number 15,

550
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,079
and having spoiled principalities and powers,

551
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,639
he made a show of them openly,

552
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:26,839
triumphing over them in it.

553
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,099
We understand as we look at this verse of Scripture,

554
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,379
the reference to principalities and powers

555
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:33,619
and we're mindful of that phraseology

556
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,979
that Paul will use just a few pages back

557
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:37,099
in the book of Ephesians

558
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,819
when he's speaking to the church there at Ephesus

559
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,219
with regard to the spiritual battle

560
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,459
in which they're engaged in

561
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:46,739
and he tells them in Ephesians 6 in verse number 10,

562
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,099
finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord

563
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,579
and the power of His might.

564
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,379
Put on the whole armor of God

565
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,379
that you may be able to stand

566
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,219
against the wiles of the devil.

567
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,139
And then he says this in verse number 12,

568
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:00,459
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, notice,

569
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,619
but against principalities, against powers,

570
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:06,139
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

571
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:09,219
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

572
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,079
And we find that he's speaking about

573
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,459
the wiles of the devil in verse number 11

574
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,579
and then he deals with in verse number 12

575
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,219
that hierarchical structure, if you will,

576
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,899
of those fallen demons

577
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,379
led by none other than Lucifer himself

578
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,699
and he says that they are principalities,

579
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,579
powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world.

580
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,499
We're fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places.

581
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:34,779
And in chapter number two of Colossians in verse number 15,

582
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,779
he says having spoiled principalities and powers.

583
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,259
That word spoiled carries with it the idea of disarming

584
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:47,319
or neutralizing an enemy.

585
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,739
Again, keep in mind that picture of the Roman triumph

586
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,879
and as the Roman soldiers would come in,

587
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,239
as they would have this parade, if you will,

588
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,599
in showing their victory,

589
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,319
they spoiled whoever this other people group was

590
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,679
and it was seen that they were left in a place

591
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,599
of being disarmed or neutralized.

592
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,439
Why?

593
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:12,639
Because they were in shackles behind the chariots.

594
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:15,579
And here the word of God says that Christ,

595
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,559
when he went to the cross of Calvary,

596
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:20,199
not only what he did for us as sinners,

597
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,799
but what he did to Satan,

598
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,759
that he spoiled principalities and powers.

599
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,219
Notice he made a show of them openly,

600
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:31,639
triumphing over them in it.

601
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,519
And so this idea of making a show of them openly

602
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,799
and triumphing over them,

603
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,159
again, to use the understanding

604
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,159
and the reference to a Roman triumph,

605
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,419
it was an open thing.

606
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,279
And the Roman soldiers were triumphing over

607
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:50,059
that people group that had been taken captive

608
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,259
and had been conquered, if you will.

609
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:53,739
And we find here that he says,

610
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,779
making a show of them openly,

611
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,899
he made a show of them openly,

612
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,059
triumphing over them in it.

613
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,380
How did he do that?

614
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,739
You understand that Satan,

615
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:04,419
and I believe all of the devils

616
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,739
and all of the demons,

617
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,659
when Christ was on the cross of Calvary,

618
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,459
they thought they had him right where they wanted him.

619
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,739
He would be defeated.

620
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:14,459
He would be conquered.

621
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,419
But up from the grave he arose.

622
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,859
And the Bible says that he made a show of them openly.

623
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,739
You know that his resurrection

624
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,779
was not something that was hidden?

625
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,139
He appeared to over 500 at one time.

626
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,940
You can read the references throughout the Word of God

627
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,659
how that he, the risen Savior,

628
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,899
made himself known and he revealed himself

629
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,339
to many people, in fact,

630
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,219
as you would look at the book of Acts

631
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,179
and think of Luke writing this particular book

632
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:52,339
to Theophilus, he says in verse number three of Acts 1,

633
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:55,539
to whom also he showed himself alive

634
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,179
after his passion, notice this phrase,

635
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,699
by many infallible...

636
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:05,259
full proofs, the evidence of His resurrection.

637
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,259
They did everything they could

638
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,299
to bar that tomb.

639
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,799
Did they not?

640
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,559
But Jesus conquered sin, death, and the grave.

641
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,559
We find that the Bible tells us

642
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,719
that this truth in Colossians 2

643
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,279
where the Word of God says

644
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,479
that He there in v. 15

645
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,999
made a show of them openly

646
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,039
triumphing over them in it,

647
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,579
that this is through the resurrection

648
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,779
and we can rejoice greatly

649
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,419
in understanding that we serve a risen Savior.

650
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,499
We find that the enemy has been defeated.

651
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,179
The enemy has been defeated.

652
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,019
But it's absolutely imperative

653
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,979
that we understand this morning

654
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,559
that though He is a defeated foe,

655
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,639
that He is active and He is attacking.

656
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,779
Remember, that's what Paul was concerned with

657
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,779
to start chapter number 2.

658
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,799
This is what caused Paul to have this great conflict.

659
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,719
It was because of the work of the enemy.

660
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,019
You understand that the enemy

661
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,219
works in a variety of ways.

662
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,099
But as we begin to think about

663
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:11,719
the fact that He's been,

664
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,019
as we notice here in v. 15,

665
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,339
that He's been conquered,

666
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:16,539
He's been defeated,

667
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,419
but we find that in the plan of God,

668
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,539
He's allowed Satan to have a certain level

669
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,739
of power that continues to exist to this day.

670
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,919
We understand that He's the prince

671
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,299
and power of the air.

672
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,539
The Bible says the God of this world,

673
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,679
little g, speaking of the devil,

674
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,759
that He hath blinded the minds of them

675
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,899
which believe not.

676
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,359
We understand that He's active

677
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,199
and He's attacking.

678
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,659
Revelation 12 and v. 12 says this.

679
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,899
Part of the verse. It's not the entire verse.

680
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,279
You don't need to turn there.

681
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,559
It says this, speaking of the devil,

682
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,079
having great wrath because He knoweth

683
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,759
that He hath but a short time.

684
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,619
What does that mean?

685
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,339
Well, the reality is that the devil knows

686
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:01,619
that He has a short time

687
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,539
because He knows what His demise is.

688
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,219
He knows what His end is.

689
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,659
And it's there in Revelation 20

690
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,059
that the Bible tells us

691
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:10,499
before we begin to read about

692
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,099
the great white throne judgment,

693
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,339
the Bible tells us this in v. 10,

694
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,459
and the devil that deceived them

695
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:21,099
was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone

696
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:23,579
where the beast and the false prophet are

697
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,359
and shall be tormented day and night

698
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:29,959
forever and ever.

699
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,559
That's not happened yet.

700
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,359
I wish it has.

701
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,999
Don't you?

702
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,279
But it hasn't.

703
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,279
And as we think about the truth

704
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,119
of Revelation 12 and v. 12,

705
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,599
that He has this great wrath

706
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,919
because He knoweth that He hath but a short time,

707
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,959
we're mindful of what it is that He's doing.

708
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,279
How is it that He's active

709
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,719
and what is it that He's doing

710
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:54,619
until we reach that time of Revelation 20

711
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:57,259
in v. 10 when He will be cast

712
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,859
in the lake of fire to be tormented

713
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:01,179
day and night forever and ever?

714
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,859
Again, I know many of us,

715
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:03,899
all of us would say,

716
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,219
I wish that happened already,

717
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:06,819
but it hasn't.

718
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,219
So what's He doing?

719
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,379
Well, number one,

720
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,159
He's seeking whom He may devour.

721
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,539
The book of 1 Peter is written to believers.

722
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,819
Turn over to 1 Peter if you will,

723
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:18,939
look at chapter number five,

724
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,199
but as you're turning to 1 Peter 5,

725
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:22,459
I'm going to remind you

726
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,339
that the book of 1 Peter is written to believers.

727
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,059
It's written to the people of God.

728
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,899
In fact, it's written to the people of God

729
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,499
that are scattered because of persecution.

730
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,619
The Bible begins in 1 Peter 1,

731
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,739
in verse number one,

732
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:35,859
where Peter says an apostle of Jesus Christ

733
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:37,939
to the strangers scattered throughout Pontius,

734
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:41,019
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

735
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,419
He then begins to talk to them

736
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:43,579
about their redemption,

737
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,139
about their salvation.

738
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:46,659
He says to them in verse number three,

739
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,699
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

740
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,519
which according to His abundant mercy

741
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,299
hath begotten us again into a lively hope

742
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,879
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

743
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:59,779
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

744
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,199
and that fadeth not away,

745
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:03,079
reserved in heaven for you,

746
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,079
who are kept by the power of God

747
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,759
through faith unto salvation,

748
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,919
ready to be revealed in the last time.

749
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,319
It's written to save people.

750
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,719
You come to chapter number five

751
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,519
in the book of 1 Peter,

752
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,159
and Peter begins to express his concern

753
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,939
to the elders and he's addressing them

754
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:24,799
specifically to these leaders.

755
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:25,979
He gives them the instruction

756
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,999
of feeding the flock of God.

757
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,799
But I want you to notice

758
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,779
what he tells us in verse number eight

759
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,379
of 1 Peter chapter number five.

760
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,639
It's a familiar verse of Scripture to us.

761
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:41,679
The Bible says,

762
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,739
be sober, be vigilant,

763
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,379
because your adversary, the devil,

764
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:52,119
notice, as a roaring lion,

765
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,139
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

766
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,939
He's active.

767
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:04,679
I'm thankful for what Christ did to Satan at Calvary,

768
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,879
but we must acknowledge as the people of God

769
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,919
that Satan is still active today.

770
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,299
I believe that he's probably more active

771
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:15,359
than he's ever been.

772
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,579
I believe that as we think about that truth

773
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,219
of Revelation 12, 12,

774
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:22,179
where it says that he has this great wrath

775
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,859
because he knows that his time is short,

776
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,699
that he hath but a short time.

777
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:28,759
I believe that, no, he does not know the hour

778
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,279
or the time of his demise,

779
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,859
but I believe that there's an understanding

780
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:35,499
and we see that he's working and he's active

781
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:37,719
and it's like he's working overtime.

782
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,419
And he's seeking whom he may devour.

783
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:46,179
You understand that as we look at this verse of Scripture

784
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:47,899
and understand the illustration

785
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:49,299
by which Peter would use,

786
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,659
he uses the analogy of a roaring lion.

787
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,619
A roaring lion.

788
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,099
If you ever watch and have the opportunity to see

789
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,539
maybe a video recording of a lion hunting

790
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,459
and how they devour their prey.

791
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,539
We find here that Satan seeks to devour.

792
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,459
I'm so thankful that Satan could never cause us

793
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:15,739
to go to hell.

794
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:19,299
If you've been saved, if you've been born again,

795
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:20,819
he can't take that.

796
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:23,019
We have an inheritance.

797
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,079
He started it in chapter one

798
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,359
that's reserved in heaven for us.

799
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,059
But we understand that he's active.

800
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:32,459
And we understand not only as we begin to think about

801
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,419
how he's active and what he's doing,

802
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:37,219
we'd understand that he is the accuser of the brethren.

803
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:39,579
We looked at Revelation 12, 12,

804
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:40,659
I quote a part of it to you,

805
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,079
but in verse number 10,

806
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,539
the Bible tells us that he is the accuser of the brethren.

807
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,439
And he is.

808
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,839
Maybe you have experienced times in which

809
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,139
the accuser of the brethren has knocked on your door.

810
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,699
Maybe there are times in which you have experienced

811
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:59,579
in which the one who seeks to devour the enemy

812
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:00,779
has knocked upon your door

813
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:04,379
that that temptation comes in your life.

814
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:06,099
As we begin to think about the truth

815
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,899
that Paul is giving to the believers in Colossae,

816
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,739
how we ought to rejoice greatly to understand

817
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:13,759
what it is that Christ did for sinners

818
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,399
and what he did to Satan.

819
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,079
But we must be mindful that though he spoiled them

820
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,079
and he made a show of them openly,

821
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,799
triumphing over them in it,

822
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:25,399
we understand that Satan is still active today.

823
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,599
He is a defeated foe.

824
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,719
It's amazing how a defeated foe

825
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:35,299
can get a foothold that turns into a stronghold.

826
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,399
We see it in the Word of God.

827
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,279
We find as the people of God,

828
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,319
as we try to take the truth of

829
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,879
Colossians chapter number two

830
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:48,919
and understand and rejoice in what Christ did for us

831
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:51,039
and also have an understanding that

832
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,039
though Satan has been defeated at the cross of Calvary

833
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,439
and though Satan has been rendered

834
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,759
in this sense of the word spoiled,

835
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:02,719
that there is this disarming or this neutralizing,

836
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,679
we know that we cannot,

837
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:09,679
we cannot engage him in battle in our flesh.

838
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,479
Can't.

839
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,759
And we understand that as the people of God,

840
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:21,279
that we still have the flesh.

841
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:22,719
How many of you are keenly aware of the fact

842
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,099
that you have a flesh?

843
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,159
And that your flesh still has some level of desires?

844
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,239
Right?

845
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,799
Paul talks about in the book of Ephesians

846
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,479
how that the flesh,

847
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:37,879
excuse me, the book of Galatians,

848
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,919
that the flesh is at enmity with the Spirit.

849
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:41,759
Right?

850
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:42,679
The flesh is at enmity.

851
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,879
There's a battle that goes on.

852
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,759
And so we understand this whole spiritual aspect

853
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:47,679
of what's going on

854
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,799
and we begin to think about as Bible believing Christians

855
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,639
as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ

856
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,719
and we can rejoice in some great promises of God's word

857
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,679
for when we engage with and we have that enemy

858
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,279
that is the accuser, the brethren

859
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:03,799
that's attacking and seeking to devour

860
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,159
that there are times in which we'll sin.

861
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,359
Have you ever sinned since you've been saved?

862
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,319
You laugh, why?

863
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:11,759
Because we all have.

864
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,159
Some of you sinned this morning, amen?

865
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,879
I mean, in the parking lot maybe.

866
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:26,159
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's word

867
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,519
with regard to forgiveness.

868
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,759
Take your Bibles under 1 John, if you will.

869
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,119
I think about the biblical Christianity,

870
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,719
we think about biblical Christianity

871
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,079
and there are so many pillars of biblical Christianity.

872
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,919
We speak about Baptist distinctives

873
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:46,639
and we talk about several of those

874
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,319
and what it is, why are you a Baptist?

875
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,079
And you can answer those questions

876
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,479
and understand that first answer to that question

877
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,079
would be that the word of God is the sole authority

878
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,399
for our faith and practice.

879
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:59,479
And you can look at all the Baptist distinctives

880
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,999
and kind of give you an idea.

881
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,079
as to what it is that a Baptist would believe and stand for.

882
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,599
But then we look at biblical Christianity

883
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,599
maybe a little bit broader from those Baptist distinctions

884
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,159
and say, what are some pillars of biblical Christianity?

885
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,999
And there are a lot of them.

886
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,799
But I would submit to you this morning

887
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:22,319
that two of those are forgiveness and restoration.

888
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,719
And for that, I am thankful.

889
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,079
Notice what John says here in 1 John chapter 1.

890
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,319
Again, we would understand even as we made reference

891
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:36,959
in the book of 1 Peter that John is writing to believers

892
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:39,639
the same way that Peter was writing to believers.

893
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,479
And as he's writing to these believers

894
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:45,079
in the book of 1 John, he says to them in verse number 8,

895
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:49,639
if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

896
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,359
And the truth is not in us.

897
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,999
But notice this great promise in verse number 9.

898
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,759
If we confess our sins,

899
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:06,919
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

900
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:11,359
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

901
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,959
If we say that we have not sinned,

902
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,959
we make Him a liar,

903
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,599
and His Word is not in us.

904
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,799
I know that we're so thankful for the promise of 1 John 1.9.

905
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:25,799
Mr. Don often will say 1 John 1.9.

906
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:29,559
He's speaking of this promise that God offers.

907
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,759
Listen, remember the Old Testament reveals to us

908
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:34,359
that God is plenteous in mercy.

909
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,279
That He is ready to pardon.

910
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:39,279
That He is ready to forgive.

911
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,599
We read into chapter number 2 here of 1 John,

912
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,279
and the Bible says,

913
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:46,239
My little children, these things write I unto you,

914
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,039
that ye sin not.

915
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,719
But then it says this, and if any man sin,

916
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:56,039
listen, it is desirous that we sin not.

917
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,079
Amen?

918
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,399
The closer we get to the Lord,

919
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,879
the more we walk with God,

920
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:04,719
the less we ought to be sinning.

921
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,079
Amen?

922
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,519
The desire is that we'd sin not,

923
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,279
but understand, contrary to what some people taught

924
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,679
hundreds of years ago,

925
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,039
you're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

926
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,839
It's just not going to happen

927
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,279
until we get to glory.

928
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:21,999
Amen?

929
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,559
When this mortal shall put on immortality,

930
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,279
when this corruption shall put on incorruption,

931
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,199
then, and only then,

932
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,639
will I no longer have a flesh

933
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,879
that will cause me to sin.

934
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:38,519
The enemy, right?

935
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,839
The way in which he comes.

936
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,759
And so, I guess if you want to call it

937
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,119
charge from John,

938
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,519
it is to sin not,

939
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,519
but then he says this,

940
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,599
see, I'm thankful for every word of God.

941
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,879
I'm thankful for the entirety of the Word of God,

942
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,319
because he says that you sin not,

943
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,799
but knowing and understanding,

944
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,759
even as we've read in chapter number one,

945
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:58,679
that we are sinners and we are going to sin.

946
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,199
He says, and if any man sin,

947
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,159
all of us,

948
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,839
we have an advocate with the Father,

949
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,359
Jesus Christ the righteous.

950
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:16,319
Aren't you thankful that you have an advocate?

951
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,039
Because you have an accuser of the brethren.

952
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,399
You have an accuser.

953
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,439
But you have an advocate.

954
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,239
You have an advocate.

955
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,359
And I'm thankful that when the advocate

956
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:31,479
stands up on our behalf,

957
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:33,799
that he can say something like this,

958
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:37,879
I paid for that.

959
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:40,639
I paid for that.

960
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,039
Amen?

961
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,599
And if we confess our sins,

962
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,719
He forgives us.

963
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,519
He says that He removes them as far as the east

964
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:50,959
from the west.

965
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,479
That they're buried in the deepest sea.

966
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:54,599
Amen?

967
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,199
We believe the Word of God.

968
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,559
And see, as we look at the whole,

969
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,039
I'm thankful for the book of Colossians.

970
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,439
Trust me, as we're studying through it,

971
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,399
I'm encouraged and I'm strengthened and I'm helped.

972
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:04,639
I'm so thankful for what Christ did

973
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,319
for sinners at Calvary.

974
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,159
As Paul would share with these believers,

975
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,879
let me help you understand

976
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:11,519
that you are complete in Christ.

977
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:12,919
Let me help you understand

978
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:14,439
that these false teachers are coming

979
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:16,679
and saying that you need something more than Christ.

980
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,959
They wouldn't say you don't need Christ,

981
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:20,679
but you need something more in addition to

982
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:23,079
to reach higher planes and so on and so forth.

983
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,719
But Paul says, listen, Christ is all we need.

984
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,359
You're complete in Christ.

985
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,919
Here's what He accomplished at Calvary for sinners.

986
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:34,639
And here's what He did to Satan at Calvary.

987
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,999
But as we have the whole of the Bible,

988
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:43,679
and we understand that Satan was defeated foe,

989
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,799
that God has allowed him to have some level of reign

990
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:53,039
in this particular era.

991
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,759
We may not like it,

992
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:58,199
but we better learn the truth of it.

993
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,159
And he's the accuser of the brethren

994
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,919
and he's seeking whom he may devour.

995
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,359
But as the accuser of the brethren

996
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,919
and as the one that's seeking whom he may devour,

997
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:12,639
I'm thankful that if we sin or when we sin,

998
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:14,919
that we have an advocate.

999
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:17,639
An advocate with the Father.

1000
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:20,759
This morning, I hope that we can rejoice greatly

1001
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,679
in understanding what Paul explains

1002
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,199
to the believers in Colossae

1003
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,079
with regard to what Christ accomplished

1004
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,319
at the cross of Calvary.

1005
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,319
If you're here this morning

1006
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:33,279
and you've never trusted Christ as your Savior,

1007
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:34,439
maybe when we were singing,

1008
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:37,199
are you washed in the blood?

1009
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,759
You're not able to answer with confidence

1010
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:43,559
that you've been saved, that you've been born again.

1011
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,719
Today is the day of salvation.

1012
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,319
Today is the day of salvation.

1013
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,879
The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior

1014
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:53,279
and He wants to save you.

1015
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,719
But for us as the people of God,

1016
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,039
would we rejoice in what Christ accomplished?

1017
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,479
But also be mindful of the battle that still continues.

1018
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:05,399
It's often been said,

1019
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:08,479
in fact, I've mentioned it on a number of occasions.

1020
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:09,559
As you read through the book of Romans,

1021
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,039
you'll see it in particular,

1022
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,839
that the Lord Jesus Christ,

1023
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,759
He delivered us from the penalty of sin.

1024
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:17,959
What's the penalty of sin?

1025
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,279
Death.

1026
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:21,279
The wage of sin is death, right?

1027
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,159
And He delivered us from the penalty of sin.

1028
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,959
He's delivered us from the power of sin.

1029
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:29,759
Sin should no longer have dominion over you.

1030
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:31,239
But we've not yet been delivered

1031
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,239
from the presence of sin.

1032
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,199
And we find that this great Bible truth,

1033
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:39,919
this great biblical principle,

1034
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:44,919
this biblical principle for Christianity,

1035
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,359
is that we believe in the pillar

1036
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,879
of forgiveness and restoration.

1037
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:53,719
And we understand that with,

1038
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,719
as a child of God,

1039
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,079
that I have an advocate

1040
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,999
that stands on my behalf.

1041
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,719
You think about the legal terminology

1042
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,919
and the legal understanding here,

1043
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:05,799
that this advocate stands on my behalf.

1044
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:07,079
And because we understand the truth

1045
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,119
of substitutionary atonement,

1046
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,119
He took my place.

1047
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,679
He took my place.

1048
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:14,399
And He took your place.

1049
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,879
Nailing it to His cross.

1050
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:22,039
I'm so thankful for what Christ did for us at Calvary.

1051
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:22,879
Let's pray.

1052
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,159
Father, how we love You this morning

1053
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:28,639
and how we thank You for Your Word.

1054
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:33,679
We thank You for that which was accomplished

1055
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,319
over 2,000 years ago there

1056
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:39,079
at the cross of Calvary.

1057
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:40,679
We thank You for what You did for sinners

1058
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,079
and for what You did to Satan.

1059
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,959
And God, as we walk with You,

1060
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:50,079
I pray that You'd help us to walk in the Spirit

1061
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,599
so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

1062
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,359
Help us, God, to be mindful that we have an enemy

1063
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:00,359
that seeks to devour,

1064
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,759
that is the accuser of the brethren.

1065
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,799
And I pray that You'd help us to rejoice greatly

1066
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,679
in knowing that we have an advocate with the Father,

1067
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,039
the Lord Jesus Christ.

1068
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,199
I pray, God, that You would help us

1069
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,639
to rejoice in that truth.

1070
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,799
If there's one that's not sure of heaven,

1071
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:23,639
it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation.

1072
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,599
The Holy Spirit of God would use the Word of God

1073
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,959
to convict and convince of sin,

1074
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:33,359
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

1075
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,919
We pray that as we have a time of invitation,

1076
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:40,399
that, Lord, You would work as only You can.

1077
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:44,719
You would move, help us, Lord, to be responsive.

1078
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,799
We pray that You'd be glorified through each decision.

1079
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,999
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1080
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:49,919
Would You stand with me?

1081
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1082
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:54,839
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1083
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,119
And as she does, the altar is open.

1084
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:57,959
If you're not sure of heaven,

1085
00:48:57,959 --> 00:48:59,079
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

1086
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:01,639
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

1087
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,679
Maybe you just need to come and ask the Lord to help you

1088
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:07,359
as you walk this Christian life,

1089
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,319
knowing that we have an adversary.

1090
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,359
Maybe there's some sin that you need to come confess

1091
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,839
and get that forgiveness and understand

1092
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,559
that you have an advocate with the Father.

1093
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,679
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
