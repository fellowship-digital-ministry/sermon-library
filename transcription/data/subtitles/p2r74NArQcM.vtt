00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
A little over three months, actually, since we've been in the book of Colossians, and

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.159
I know that many of you take notes and have your notebooks, and if you want to mark down,

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:13.640
this is message number 10 through the book of Colossians, but message number 9 was on

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.359
March 14th.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.879
And so I don't know if you want to put a little notation maybe in your notes so that you can

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.680
be able to go back and see the continuation, if you will.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.719
But as we look at Colossians 2 this morning, we'll be looking at verses 11 through 15.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.879
And notice what the Word of God says here, beginning in verse number 11 of Colossians

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:32.880
2.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.200
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.279
of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:54.759
also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
from the dead.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.119
Verse 13.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:04.199
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.519
with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:18.099
that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.360
to his cross.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.959
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.000
over them in it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.919
Notice the last phrase of verse number 14.

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:32.319
We'll use it for our title this morning.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.959
Nailing it to his cross.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.540
We of course sang that wonderful, familiar hymn this morning.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.279
It is well with my soul, and that third verse speaks about my sin, O the bliss of this glorious

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:45.279
thought.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:52.559
My sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to his cross, and I bear it no more.

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.000
Isn't that wonderful?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.879
And here we find that Paul is writing to these believers in Colossae, of course, if we could

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.239
take, since it's been so long since we've looked at Colossians, the book, and chapter

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.239
2 in particular.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:10.600
We'll be reminded this morning by way of introduction that Colossians 2 begins with Paul expressing

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.759
his concern for the brethren.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.919
In fact, he voices it this way.

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:20.160
He says in verse number 1 that he has this conflict.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.839
He says, I have a great conflict for you.

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:28.639
And we understand as we begin to study Colossians chapter number 2 and read about this conflict,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.399
this concern that Paul had for these believers, not only here at Colossae, but also those

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:39.759
in the city of Laodicea, we understand that he was concerned for them because the enemy

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.919
was active.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:47.119
The enemy was working and the enemy was active, and Paul has this concern for the brethren,

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:52.380
and that concern leads him to the next several verses by which we took two messages to study

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.279
through, verses really 4 through 10, and we dealt with the subject matter of the warning.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:04.360
Remember that the apostle Paul, as he highlighted and explained to the believers in Colossae

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.279
what his ministry was, he said that he was ministering and he was seeking to teach every

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:15.559
man, but that his ministry also included warning every man.

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:21.360
And as we look at Colossians chapter number 2, we see that Paul is issuing these warnings,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.360
and Paul is seeking to help the believers understand how it is that the enemy works

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.800
and how it is that we as the people of God are to combat the enemy.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.479
We find that the warning was issued, and of course it was their responsibility to take

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.279
heed to that which had been given.

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:45.380
We find that Paul would explain several things in our text that we're going to look at this

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.039
morning in verses 11 through 15 as to that which was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.919
on the cross of Calvary.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.399
I'm so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross, amen?

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.520
I'm so thankful that he took my place.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.839
The plan of redemption was determined before the foundation of the world, and the price

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:09.080
of redemption was determined to be the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.240
And we understand that he came and he fulfilled.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.399
He said when he hung upon that cross before he gave up the ghost, it is finished.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.399
And I'm so thankful that as Paul would begin to share with these believers in Colossae

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:28.720
some of that which was accomplished at Calvary, it's right after he tells them in verse number

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.640
10, and we've used it for our theme this year, ye are complete in him, complete in Christ.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.720
And some of that false teaching that was taking place there in Colossae that was prevalent

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.959
at this particular time would cause people to think that they needed something in addition

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.959
to Christ.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.920
Yes, there are those that would give false teaching and they would say, well, Christ

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.440
plus your works, and so on and so forth.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.859
But we find that these particular false teachers, they would speak about some level of maybe

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:07.359
mysticism and what have you, and the going deeper, if you will, and the way in which

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:12.760
some of these believers would have been influenced by this false teaching.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.640
And Paul helps them understand, you're complete in Christ, you're complete in Christ.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.359
Let me share with you what was accomplished at Calvary.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.440
If you're taking notes this morning, notice number one with me.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.920
Consider what Christ did for sinners.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.399
Consider what Christ did for sinners.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:34.679
In verses 11 through 14, the Apostle Paul will share with these believers in Colossae

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:38.160
what was accomplished on the cross of Calvary for sinners.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.839
By the way, all men are sinners, amen?

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.640
And as we begin to look at this text of Scripture, we understand that Paul is writing to the

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.720
believers in Colossae, and as he's writing to these individuals, he reminds them of

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.720
what they were, but then he reminds them of what they are because of what Christ accomplished

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.200
at Calvary for sinners.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.359
And as we begin to understand and unfold some of these things, again, as I mentioned a moment

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:01.959
ago, all men are sinners.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.519
Yes, it's written to these believers in Colossae, but we understand that the truth that is contained

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:13.040
herein is truth that is applicable to every man, every human being that's ever walked

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.720
upon the face of the earth.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.359
We understand, even as we would look at nature, why does an apple tree produce apples?

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:23.760
Because it's an apple tree, right?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.239
Pretty simple truth, pretty simple understanding, and that apple tree does not produce peaches

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.640
because it's an apple tree.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.359
And why is it that human beings sin?

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:37.720
It's because we're sinners.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.720
And we're sinners, and therefore we sin, and there's this huge problem.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.559
It's a condition that affects all mankind of sin.

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:52.359
We find that here sin would be dealt with at Calvary, and Paul is reminding them of

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:54.480
some of these things that were accomplished.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.660
First we understand what we were.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:04.200
Notice what he says here in verse number 13, and you being dead in your sins and in the

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.959
uncircumcision of your flesh.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.600
Notice in verse number 14, blotting out the handwriting, but notice what it says here,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.119
of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us.

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:22.720
If we could simply just highlight a couple of things with regard to the condition of

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.200
mankind, we'd understand that man is condemned already.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.440
We understand that we're dead in our sins and in our transgressions.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:39.320
We understand that we have this handwriting of ordinances that was against us, it was

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:45.880
contrary to us, and we find that as we would look at this truth of being condemned and

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.739
being dead in our sins, we find that we would simply be able to say this, we are guilty

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:53.480
before a holy God.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480
We're guilty.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.839
I think about the nation of Israel, and you think about the truth of the Ten Commandments,

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:05.239
and it's interesting in Exodus 19 when Moses is confronting the children of Israel before

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:09.720
God would call him up to the mount in chapter number 20, but we find that God and Moses

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.040
had some interaction in chapter 19, and Moses has then some interaction with the people

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.480
of God, and the people say in Exodus 19, all that the Lord would command, we will do.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.559
We find that it's in Exodus chapter number 20 that God gives those Ten Commandments.

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:31.239
We know that the law in its entirety is much broader than simply Ten Commandments, but

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:36.239
we find that they had said, whatever the Lord commands, we will do.

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:38.599
Now how did they do with that?

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.080
Not so well.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.280
Why?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.479
Because the law reveals the condition of mankind.

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:47.359
The law shows us that we're sinners.

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:49.599
The law shows us that we're condemned.

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:54.419
In fact, James says it this way in James 2, in verse number 10, when we think about this

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:59.799
truth with regard to the law, the Bible says, for whosoever shall keep the whole law and

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:07.200
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.080
We find that the Word of God would teach us about our condition, and here Paul is reminding

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.440
these believers of their condition.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.239
When the Gospel first came to them, how it was that God in His grace and His mercy brought

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:24.880
the truth to them because they were condemned already.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.239
Remember what God says, the Lord Jesus Christ says this in John 3, after an interaction

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:35.520
with Nicodemus, we find in John 3, in verse number 16, a very familiar verse of Scripture

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520
to us.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.799
The Bible says, for God so loved the world.

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:41.640
Aren't you thankful for the love of God?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.640
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.200
in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.799
Notice verse 17, for God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that

00:09:56.799 --> 00:10:00.039
the world through Him might be saved.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.639
He that believeth on him is not condemned,

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.299
but he that believeth not is condemned already,

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:08.299
because he hath not believed in the name

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:11.639
of the only begotten Son of God."

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:14.239
We are condemned already.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.399
We're at enmity with God.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.099
Romans 5 and verse 8 says that

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:19.939
God commendeth His love toward us

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:22.399
and that while we were yet sinners,

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.759
Christ died for us.

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:27.999
We find that 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21,

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.459
as Paul is there sharing with the believers

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:32.439
in Corinth and expressing to them

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:34.739
all that Christ did for us

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:36.639
and the plan of redemption

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.819
and the imputed righteousness

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:40.679
upon the child of God.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:41.279
He says,

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.759
"...for He," speaking of God,

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:44.799
"...hath made Him," speaking of Jesus,

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:47.919
"...hath made Him to be sin for us,"

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.879
notice, "...who knew no sin,

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.959
that we might be made

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:55.599
the righteousness of God in Him."

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:56.879
Peter says it this way.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:59.679
If you take and turn to 1 Peter 4,

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.139
notice what Peter says here

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:05.319
with regard to the work at Calvary

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:07.979
and to the work that was accomplished.

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:13.999
1 Peter 3

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:18.739
I want you to notice verse 18.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:20.759
1 Peter 3 and verse 18,

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:25.559
"...for Christ also hath once suffered for sins."

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.399
Notice this,

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:29.439
"...the just for the unjust,

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.239
that He might bring us to God,

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:33.239
being put to death in the flesh,

00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:36.919
but quickened by the Spirit."

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.319
And so we find that Paul,

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:41.439
as he begins to speak to these believers in Colossae,

00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:43.079
and after he'd given them warning

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:45.119
and dealing with some of the false teaching

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:46.319
that's taking place there,

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:47.839
he's going to remind them

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.799
what they are in Christ.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:52.319
And before he begins to express to them

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:53.239
what they are,

00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:55.479
he reminds them of what they were.

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:57.639
That they were dead in their sins

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:58.759
and their trespasses,

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.679
as he says to the believers in Ephesus.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:03.319
That they had this handwriting of ordinances

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:04.319
that was against us,

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:05.399
that was contrary to us.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:08.439
Listen, we were guilty.

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:11.279
There's no way that we could ever stand

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:15.359
and say, nope, I fulfilled all of it.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.919
We're guilty.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.679
We're guilty.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:21.039
As we begin to think about what we were,

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:23.319
we can rejoice greatly in what we now are.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.519
And notice with me in this same passage here

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.279
in Colossians 2, in verse 13,

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:30.839
we've only read portions of these two verses

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.079
in our first aspect of this point,

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:34.239
but notice the Bible says,

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:36.359
"...and you, being dead in your sins

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:38.279
and the uncircumcision of your flesh,"

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.279
notice this,

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:44.239
"...hath He quickened together with Him."

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.719
That word quickened means to make alive.

00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:49.159
And we understand the truth of the rebirth.

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:51.599
You must be born again.

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.319
And I'm so thankful for the truth

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:57.079
of the supernatural, the spiritual birth,

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:00.039
and the truth of being born again,

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:02.959
being redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.239
And we find here that He says that you,

00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:07.679
"...hath He quickened together with Him."

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:10.159
Then notice the final phrase of verse 13,

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:12.839
"...having forgiven you..."

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:15.199
What's that next word say?

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:18.319
Aren't you thankful for every word of God?

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:23.799
"...having forgiven you all trespasses."

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:26.119
Isn't it good to be forgiven?

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:28.199
I mean, honestly.

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:31.639
He didn't say He forgave you most.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.039
He didn't say He forgave you some.

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:38.759
He said, "...forgiving you all trespasses."

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:40.959
Notice how He begins verse 14,

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:43.519
"...blotting out..."

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.759
Now notice it says,

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.119
"...the handwriting of ordinances

00:13:46.119 --> 00:13:48.199
that was against us which was contrary to us,

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.999
and we understand that that handwriting

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.559
of ordinance was against us,

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.399
that we are guilty..."

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.119
Remember when they found the lady,

00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:58.639
they said we've caught her in the very act

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.359
in this immorality,

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:03.599
and they were going there to accuse her

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:05.119
that they might stone her.

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:07.959
And what did Jesus do?

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:09.079
He wrote in the sand.

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.319
I don't know what He wrote.

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:12.799
I can only imagine what He wrote

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:15.119
were some of the sins that those very people

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:18.159
were guilty of.

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.359
And He says what?

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:24.199
The one that has no sin casts the first stone.

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.199
Amen?

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:27.119
I'm thankful that He's blotted out.

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:28.239
Listen, we're guilty.

00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:30.639
The handwriting of ordinances that was against us,

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:31.999
that was contrary to us,

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:34.159
but He's blotted it out.

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.599
And you think about the way that He did that

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:37.879
we sang this morning.

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:40.439
Are you washed in the blood?

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:44.519
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.919
It's through the blood of Jesus Christ,

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.199
His death, burial, and resurrection,

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.079
that that handwriting of ordinances

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:52.199
that was against us,

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.559
that was contrary to us,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.079
it's only through His blood

00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:57.279
that it can be blotted out.

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:59.999
And hallelujah for that.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.719
We find that He says blotting out

00:15:01.719 --> 00:15:03.079
the handwriting of ordinances

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:03.999
that was against us

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:05.999
and really carrying with it that idea

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:07.839
of what I mentioned in the beginning of the message

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:08.839
this morning,

00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:12.519
how that Jesus said it is finished.

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.999
It is finished.

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:15.359
If you've ever had a mortgage,

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:17.239
if you've ever had any kind of a loan,

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:18.679
and it finally comes to the end

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.879
of the final payment,

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.319
and there's something that you get,

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:23.839
this promissory note when you receive the loan,

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.119
and then that promissory note

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:26.719
when it's paid in full,

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:28.839
they issue paid in full.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:29.719
It's complete.

00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:31.919
It's done with.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:34.719
And here we find that this handwriting

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:36.279
of ordinances that was against us,

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:37.519
that was contrary to us,

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.599
that it was blotted out.

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:40.559
Notice what He says at the end of the verse.

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:44.239
He took it out of the way.

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:47.319
Nailing it to His cross.

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:49.439
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:52.279
We begin to think about what we were.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:54.399
That we were dead in our sins

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.319
and our trespasses.

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:56.399
That we were condemned.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.079
That we were guilty.

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.799
But when you think about what we are,

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.479
thinking that we've been made alive,

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:03.519
we've been quickened together with Him.

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.039
We have been forgiven

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:07.279
of all of our trespasses.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.119
That they've been blotted out.

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:10.759
That He's taken it out of the way.

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:12.319
Nailing it to His cross

00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.999
that now we can stand

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:16.039
and understand that we've been redeemed.

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:18.599
That we've been reconciled to God Almighty.

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:19.999
That we have been imputed

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:23.879
with the very righteousness of God Almighty.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.999
The Bible tells us this in the book of Romans

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:28.119
in chapter 5 and verse 1.

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:29.959
I'll give you a moment to turn there.

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:31.599
We'll look at a couple of verses here

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.679
in the book of Romans.

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:34.279
But notice Romans 5.

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:37.079
We referenced a moment ago verse 8.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.799
But I want you to look at verse 1

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:44.319
in Romans 5.

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:47.679
The Bible says this in Romans 5 and verse 1,

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.759
Therefore, being justified by faith,

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:54.479
we have peace with God

00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:57.039
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:57.039 --> 00:16:59.319
The only way to be justified is by faith

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.079
and we understand that the only way

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:02.279
to have peace with God

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:04.959
is through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.239
I'm thankful for reconciliation

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:09.199
that when we were guilty and condemned

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:11.239
and we were distant and separated

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.759
from God Almighty,

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:15.279
that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:17.759
reconciled us.

00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:19.879
That we can enter into His very presence.

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:22.719
Notice chapter 8.

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.719
Notice what the Word of God says here

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:27.479
in Romans 8 and verse 1.

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:32.639
There is therefore now no condemnation

00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:37.159
to them which are in Christ Jesus,

00:17:37.159 --> 00:17:38.359
who walk not after the flesh,

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.639
but after the Spirit.

00:17:39.639 --> 00:17:41.559
Isn't it wonderful to be in Christ?

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:44.999
To have understanding of what Christ did for us

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:45.959
at Calvary.

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:48.279
What He did for sinners.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:51.879
The reality is that if we remove the truth

00:17:51.879 --> 00:17:55.159
and the record of Calvary,

00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:58.039
we're hopeless and helpless.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.759
We are condemned.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.839
But I'm thankful that Jesus did come

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:03.279
and that He did fulfill.

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.679
Remember, the book of Galatians tells us

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.439
that at the appointed time,

00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:09.399
that when the fullness of time was come,

00:18:09.399 --> 00:18:12.159
that God sent forth His Son.

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.599
And the Bible gives us very clear indication

00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:17.279
as to why God sent forth His Son.

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:19.199
He sent forth His Son,

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:20.439
being made of a woman,

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:21.359
made under the law,

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:24.639
to redeem them that were under the law.

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:27.039
Why? Because we're guilty.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.199
We're condemned already.

00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:32.079
I'm thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.199
accomplished at the cross of Calvary.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.799
Notice back in Colossians 2,

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.679
not only do we see as we consider

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:41.639
what Christ did for sinners here at Calvary,

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:43.719
not only do we notice the phrases

00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:45.759
that are given to us in verses 13 and 14,

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:48.119
but we're mindful of that which is given to us

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:49.519
in verses 11 and 12.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.719
Notice what He says in verse 11,

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:53.959
in whom also you are circumcised

00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:58.199
with the circumcision made without hands,

00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:00.599
and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.279
by the circumcision of Christ.

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.479
All of a sudden now in verse 11,

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.119
this subject matter of circumcision comes up,

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:10.320
but Paul begins to deal with circumcision

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.919
from a different perspective.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.519
Jewish people, of course,

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.199
would have had a very clear understanding

00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:17.199
of circumcision as soon as they hear

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.239
the word being circumcised,

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:20.839
they immediately begin thinking

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:23.279
of the token of the Abrahamic covenant,

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:25.159
the circumcision of flesh,

00:19:25.159 --> 00:19:28.119
but we find that it was not the Abrahamic covenant

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:29.159
that was being dealt with,

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:30.839
it was the new covenant,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.320
and it was the circumcision of the heart.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.239
And Paul is dealing here with that truth

00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:39.159
of what Christ did,

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:41.119
and you think about conversion,

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:43.159
and he says here that you're circumcised,

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:47.959
notice this, with the circumcision made without hands.

00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:50.159
He's not talking about the token

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:51.919
of the Abrahamic covenant.

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:54.440
That's not in his view, in his focus,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.159
he's speaking about something entirely different,

00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:58.799
something for the child of God,

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.599
the one that has been born again.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.599
Again, he says that you're circumcised

00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:04.839
with this circumcision made without hands

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:07.919
and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:11.839
by the circumcision of Christ.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:12.999
Isn't that wonderful?

00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:15.819
This new covenant that has been introduced,

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:17.479
of course, the children of Israel

00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:20.099
in the book of Jeremiah in particular,

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.759
they would have knowledge of the new covenant.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:25.259
You read the book of Hebrews as we studied last year

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:27.639
and you see references to the new covenant.

00:20:27.639 --> 00:20:30.879
You find here that Paul is helping these individuals.

00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:33.479
Now, you remember that there were all sorts

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:36.659
of these false teachings with regard to circumcision.

00:20:36.659 --> 00:20:38.799
In fact, it was in Galatians that they said

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:41.799
unless you're circumcised, you can't be saved.

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:45.239
And really, we find that that was dealt with

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:46.799
if you go back to the book of Acts

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.039
and you read and you understand the,

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.719
really the council that took place there in Jerusalem.

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:54.039
It's recorded for us, you don't need to turn there,

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:57.619
but it's recorded for us in Acts chapter number 15.

00:20:58.459 --> 00:20:59.699
And there were some people that were saying this,

00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:02.819
except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses,

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:06.739
notice they said, ye cannot be saved.

00:21:06.739 --> 00:21:09.099
And Paul says, no, no, no, that's not true.

00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:10.299
That's not true.

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:12.459
And they have this whole meeting and they determine,

00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:15.299
yes, it's not true, it's not biblically accurate.

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:18.699
And so we find that they now here in Colossae,

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:20.559
it wasn't so much that they would be saying

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:23.659
that you had to be circumcised in order to be saved,

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:28.579
but having circumcision somehow elevates your position,

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:32.019
right, it elevates your standing with God.

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:35.879
But Paul says, no, no, no, you're complete in Him.

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.819
You're complete in Him and you have received

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:41.899
this circumcision that's entirely different

00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:44.539
to that which they would deal with in the Old Testament

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:47.259
to that which was the token of the Abrahamic covenant

00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:50.579
because you've been circumcised with that circumcision

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:54.859
that is made without hands, the circumcision of the heart.

00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:57.059
By the way, throughout the Old Testament,

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:00.459
was it not clearly given to the children of Israel

00:22:00.459 --> 00:22:02.539
that God was concerned about their heart?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.159
You're doing all of these outward things.

00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:10.179
You followed the token, the right of circumcision,

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:11.979
if you will, and you've done these things

00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:13.559
and you've followed these feasts,

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:16.819
but your heart is far from me, right?

00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:19.219
There you see it all throughout the Old Testament,

00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:21.459
God's concern for the heart.

00:22:21.459 --> 00:22:22.779
In verse number 12,

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:25.619
he deals with the subject matter of baptism.

00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:28.819
He says, buried with Him in baptism,

00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:31.659
wherein also you're risen with Him

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:34.499
through the faith of the operation of God

00:22:34.499 --> 00:22:38.019
who hath raised Him from the dead.

00:22:38.019 --> 00:22:40.699
Begin to think about the truth of baptism.

00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:43.019
We find not only would the mode of baptism

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:46.219
be clearly revealed here as being that of immersion,

00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:49.539
for the Bible says that you're buried with Him in baptism

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:51.059
and then risen with Him

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:53.059
through the faith of the operation of God.

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:55.859
And we understand that baptism is an outward expression

00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:57.999
of an inward experience.

00:22:57.999 --> 00:23:01.979
We understand this morning that baptism cannot save you

00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:05.779
the same way that circumcision cannot save you.

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:07.379
And there are some, unfortunately,

00:23:07.379 --> 00:23:09.459
that have misunderstood and misapplied

00:23:09.459 --> 00:23:11.899
and they believe and they teach and practice

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:13.859
this thing of infant baptism

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:15.019
and thinking that somehow,

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.899
just like the children of Israel,

00:23:16.899 --> 00:23:19.139
on eight days they would circumcise their boys,

00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:21.379
that if you were baptized as an infant

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:23.879
that somehow you have this entrance

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:27.419
into this covenant with God

00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:30.399
and it's foreign to the Bible.

00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:31.859
You can't find it anywhere

00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:34.179
within the pages of Scripture of infant baptism.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:37.179
In fact, every person that you read of being baptized

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:39.199
in the Word of God is somebody that is an adult

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:40.459
that's made a decision,

00:23:40.459 --> 00:23:42.459
someone that is able to acknowledge

00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:44.539
that they have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:45.939
as their personal Savior

00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:49.519
and therefore they follow the Lord in believer's baptism.

00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:52.899
We find that there are those

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:54.519
that have confused some of these things,

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:57.579
but Paul is helping these believers to understand,

00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:01.299
again, what it was that Christ did for sinners at Calvary.

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:04.739
What was it that was accomplished at Calvary?

00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:07.419
Why is it that there are so many songs

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:11.799
that we as the people of God sing about Calvary?

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:14.759
There are so many songs that contain within,

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:17.919
maybe if the title specifically doesn't deal with the cross

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:19.039
or with Calvary,

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:22.519
but the words within the songs are reminding us

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:24.359
of what Christ did at Calvary

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:28.119
and the impact that it makes for us as children of God.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:30.799
I can only be a child of God because of Calvary.

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.119
Amen?

00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:37.039
As we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:41.899
we can rejoice greatly in our standing with Christ.

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:44.599
Yes, we can be reminded of what we were,

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:48.539
but how we ought to rejoice in what we now are in Christ.

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:50.339
Number two this morning, if you're taking notes,

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:54.719
I want you to consider not only what Christ did for sinners,

00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:56.019
but I want you to notice number two

00:24:56.019 --> 00:24:59.639
and consider with me what Christ did to Satan.

00:25:00.619 --> 00:25:03.999
In verse number 15, there's a clear indication

00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:07.139
of how it is that Christ triumphed over Satan.

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.679
Now understand with me this morning

00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:10.719
that the readers of this particular book,

00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:12.199
when it was initially given,

00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:13.439
they would have been familiar

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:17.079
with what they would be able to refer to as a Roman triumph.

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:18.259
They would be very familiar

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:20.919
with how the Romans would go into battle

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:22.359
and as they would be victorious

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:24.319
and as they would triumph over someone,

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:25.639
they would be understanding

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:27.619
of how they would come back with a parade

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:29.599
and all of the hoopla that would go with it

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:32.519
and how they would triumph over their enemies,

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:36.299
how that they would bring some enemies back with them

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:37.399
that would be shackled,

00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:40.759
that would be behind the chariots, if you will,

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:43.079
that would be publicly shamed

00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:45.479
and it would be a triumph for the Romans

00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:47.239
and the particular general,

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:48.679
if you want to use that terminology,

00:25:48.679 --> 00:25:52.759
that was able to be successful in battle.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:54.519
They would have been familiar with that process.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.359
They would have had an awareness

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:59.239
of that particular situation

00:25:59.239 --> 00:26:00.359
and we find that I believe

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:02.959
that Paul would use that familiar event

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:06.439
to explain and illustrate to these believers at Colossae

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:07.759
and for us this morning

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:11.139
what it was that Christ did to Satan at Calvary.

00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:14.559
The Bible says this in verse number 15,

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:20.079
and having spoiled principalities and powers,

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.639
he made a show of them openly,

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:26.839
triumphing over them in it.

00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:29.099
We understand as we look at this verse of Scripture,

00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:31.379
the reference to principalities and powers

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:33.619
and we're mindful of that phraseology

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.979
that Paul will use just a few pages back

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:37.099
in the book of Ephesians

00:26:37.099 --> 00:26:39.819
when he's speaking to the church there at Ephesus

00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:42.219
with regard to the spiritual battle

00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:43.459
in which they're engaged in

00:26:43.459 --> 00:26:46.739
and he tells them in Ephesians 6 in verse number 10,

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:49.099
finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord

00:26:49.099 --> 00:26:50.579
and the power of His might.

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:52.379
Put on the whole armor of God

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:53.379
that you may be able to stand

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:55.219
against the wiles of the devil.

00:26:55.219 --> 00:26:57.139
And then he says this in verse number 12,

00:26:57.139 --> 00:27:00.459
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, notice,

00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:03.619
but against principalities, against powers,

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:06.139
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:09.219
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:11.079
And we find that he's speaking about

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:13.459
the wiles of the devil in verse number 11

00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:15.579
and then he deals with in verse number 12

00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:18.219
that hierarchical structure, if you will,

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:19.899
of those fallen demons

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:22.379
led by none other than Lucifer himself

00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:24.699
and he says that they are principalities,

00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:27.579
powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:31.499
We're fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:34.779
And in chapter number two of Colossians in verse number 15,

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.779
he says having spoiled principalities and powers.

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:45.259
That word spoiled carries with it the idea of disarming

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:47.319
or neutralizing an enemy.

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:51.739
Again, keep in mind that picture of the Roman triumph

00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.879
and as the Roman soldiers would come in,

00:27:53.959 --> 00:27:56.239
as they would have this parade, if you will,

00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:58.599
in showing their victory,

00:27:58.599 --> 00:28:02.319
they spoiled whoever this other people group was

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:05.679
and it was seen that they were left in a place

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:07.599
of being disarmed or neutralized.

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:08.439
Why?

00:28:08.439 --> 00:28:12.639
Because they were in shackles behind the chariots.

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:15.579
And here the word of God says that Christ,

00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:17.559
when he went to the cross of Calvary,

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.199
not only what he did for us as sinners,

00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:21.799
but what he did to Satan,

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:25.759
that he spoiled principalities and powers.

00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:29.219
Notice he made a show of them openly,

00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:31.639
triumphing over them in it.

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.519
And so this idea of making a show of them openly

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:35.799
and triumphing over them,

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.159
again, to use the understanding

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:40.159
and the reference to a Roman triumph,

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:42.419
it was an open thing.

00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:46.279
And the Roman soldiers were triumphing over

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:50.059
that people group that had been taken captive

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:52.259
and had been conquered, if you will.

00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:53.739
And we find here that he says,

00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:55.779
making a show of them openly,

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:57.899
he made a show of them openly,

00:28:57.899 --> 00:29:00.059
triumphing over them in it.

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:01.380
How did he do that?

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.739
You understand that Satan,

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:04.419
and I believe all of the devils

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.739
and all of the demons,

00:29:05.739 --> 00:29:07.659
when Christ was on the cross of Calvary,

00:29:07.659 --> 00:29:10.459
they thought they had him right where they wanted him.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.739
He would be defeated.

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:14.459
He would be conquered.

00:29:16.659 --> 00:29:18.419
But up from the grave he arose.

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:25.859
And the Bible says that he made a show of them openly.

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:27.739
You know that his resurrection

00:29:27.739 --> 00:29:29.779
was not something that was hidden?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.139
He appeared to over 500 at one time.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.940
You can read the references throughout the Word of God

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.659
how that he, the risen Savior,

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:42.899
made himself known and he revealed himself

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:44.339
to many people, in fact,

00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:46.219
as you would look at the book of Acts

00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:49.179
and think of Luke writing this particular book

00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:52.339
to Theophilus, he says in verse number three of Acts 1,

00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:55.539
to whom also he showed himself alive

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:58.179
after his passion, notice this phrase,

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:00.699
by many infallible...

00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:05.259
full proofs, the evidence of His resurrection.

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:07.259
They did everything they could

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:09.299
to bar that tomb.

00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:11.799
Did they not?

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:16.559
But Jesus conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.559
We find that the Bible tells us

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.719
that this truth in Colossians 2

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:22.279
where the Word of God says

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:25.479
that He there in v. 15

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:26.999
made a show of them openly

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.039
triumphing over them in it,

00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:31.579
that this is through the resurrection

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:33.779
and we can rejoice greatly

00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:38.419
in understanding that we serve a risen Savior.

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:41.499
We find that the enemy has been defeated.

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:44.179
The enemy has been defeated.

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:46.019
But it's absolutely imperative

00:30:46.019 --> 00:30:47.979
that we understand this morning

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:50.559
that though He is a defeated foe,

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:54.639
that He is active and He is attacking.

00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:56.779
Remember, that's what Paul was concerned with

00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:58.779
to start chapter number 2.

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:01.799
This is what caused Paul to have this great conflict.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:03.719
It was because of the work of the enemy.

00:31:03.719 --> 00:31:05.019
You understand that the enemy

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.219
works in a variety of ways.

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:10.099
But as we begin to think about

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.719
the fact that He's been,

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:14.019
as we notice here in v. 15,

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:15.339
that He's been conquered,

00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:16.539
He's been defeated,

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:18.419
but we find that in the plan of God,

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:20.539
He's allowed Satan to have a certain level

00:31:20.539 --> 00:31:23.739
of power that continues to exist to this day.

00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:25.919
We understand that He's the prince

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:27.299
and power of the air.

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:29.539
The Bible says the God of this world,

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:31.679
little g, speaking of the devil,

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:33.759
that He hath blinded the minds of them

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:34.899
which believe not.

00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:36.359
We understand that He's active

00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:40.199
and He's attacking.

00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:42.659
Revelation 12 and v. 12 says this.

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:44.899
Part of the verse. It's not the entire verse.

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:46.279
You don't need to turn there.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.559
It says this, speaking of the devil,

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:52.079
having great wrath because He knoweth

00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:55.759
that He hath but a short time.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.619
What does that mean?

00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:00.339
Well, the reality is that the devil knows

00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:01.619
that He has a short time

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.539
because He knows what His demise is.

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:05.219
He knows what His end is.

00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:07.659
And it's there in Revelation 20

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.059
that the Bible tells us

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:10.499
before we begin to read about

00:32:10.499 --> 00:32:12.099
the great white throne judgment,

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:14.339
the Bible tells us this in v. 10,

00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:17.459
and the devil that deceived them

00:32:17.459 --> 00:32:21.099
was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone

00:32:21.099 --> 00:32:23.579
where the beast and the false prophet are

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:26.359
and shall be tormented day and night

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:29.959
forever and ever.

00:32:29.959 --> 00:32:32.559
That's not happened yet.

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:34.359
I wish it has.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.999
Don't you?

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:39.279
But it hasn't.

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:41.279
And as we think about the truth

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:43.119
of Revelation 12 and v. 12,

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:44.599
that He has this great wrath

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:46.919
because He knoweth that He hath but a short time,

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:48.959
we're mindful of what it is that He's doing.

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:50.279
How is it that He's active

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.719
and what is it that He's doing

00:32:51.739 --> 00:32:54.619
until we reach that time of Revelation 20

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:57.259
in v. 10 when He will be cast

00:32:57.259 --> 00:32:58.859
in the lake of fire to be tormented

00:32:58.859 --> 00:33:01.179
day and night forever and ever?

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:02.859
Again, I know many of us,

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:03.899
all of us would say,

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.219
I wish that happened already,

00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:06.819
but it hasn't.

00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:08.219
So what's He doing?

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:09.379
Well, number one,

00:33:10.299 --> 00:33:12.159
He's seeking whom He may devour.

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:16.539
The book of 1 Peter is written to believers.

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:17.819
Turn over to 1 Peter if you will,

00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:18.939
look at chapter number five,

00:33:18.939 --> 00:33:21.199
but as you're turning to 1 Peter 5,

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:22.459
I'm going to remind you

00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:24.339
that the book of 1 Peter is written to believers.

00:33:24.339 --> 00:33:26.059
It's written to the people of God.

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:27.899
In fact, it's written to the people of God

00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:30.499
that are scattered because of persecution.

00:33:30.499 --> 00:33:32.619
The Bible begins in 1 Peter 1,

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:33.739
in verse number one,

00:33:33.739 --> 00:33:35.859
where Peter says an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:33:35.859 --> 00:33:37.939
to the strangers scattered throughout Pontius,

00:33:37.939 --> 00:33:41.019
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.419
He then begins to talk to them

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:43.579
about their redemption,

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:45.139
about their salvation.

00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:46.659
He says to them in verse number three,

00:33:46.659 --> 00:33:49.699
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:51.519
which according to His abundant mercy

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:54.299
hath begotten us again into a lively hope

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:56.879
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

00:33:56.879 --> 00:33:59.779
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:01.199
and that fadeth not away,

00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:03.079
reserved in heaven for you,

00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:05.079
who are kept by the power of God

00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:06.759
through faith unto salvation,

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:09.919
ready to be revealed in the last time.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.319
It's written to save people.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.719
You come to chapter number five

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.519
in the book of 1 Peter,

00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:19.159
and Peter begins to express his concern

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.939
to the elders and he's addressing them

00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:24.799
specifically to these leaders.

00:34:24.799 --> 00:34:25.979
He gives them the instruction

00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:27.999
of feeding the flock of God.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.799
But I want you to notice

00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:34.779
what he tells us in verse number eight

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:37.379
of 1 Peter chapter number five.

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:39.639
It's a familiar verse of Scripture to us.

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:41.679
The Bible says,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.739
be sober, be vigilant,

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:48.379
because your adversary, the devil,

00:34:49.499 --> 00:34:52.119
notice, as a roaring lion,

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:58.139
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:01.939
He's active.

00:35:01.939 --> 00:35:04.679
I'm thankful for what Christ did to Satan at Calvary,

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:08.879
but we must acknowledge as the people of God

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:10.919
that Satan is still active today.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:14.299
I believe that he's probably more active

00:35:14.299 --> 00:35:15.359
than he's ever been.

00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:18.579
I believe that as we think about that truth

00:35:18.919 --> 00:35:20.219
of Revelation 12, 12,

00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:22.179
where it says that he has this great wrath

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:23.859
because he knows that his time is short,

00:35:23.859 --> 00:35:25.699
that he hath but a short time.

00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:28.759
I believe that, no, he does not know the hour

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:30.279
or the time of his demise,

00:35:30.279 --> 00:35:32.859
but I believe that there's an understanding

00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:35.499
and we see that he's working and he's active

00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:37.719
and it's like he's working overtime.

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:43.419
And he's seeking whom he may devour.

00:35:43.419 --> 00:35:46.179
You understand that as we look at this verse of Scripture

00:35:46.179 --> 00:35:47.899
and understand the illustration

00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:49.299
by which Peter would use,

00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:52.659
he uses the analogy of a roaring lion.

00:35:54.139 --> 00:35:55.619
A roaring lion.

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:59.099
If you ever watch and have the opportunity to see

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:03.539
maybe a video recording of a lion hunting

00:36:03.539 --> 00:36:06.459
and how they devour their prey.

00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:11.539
We find here that Satan seeks to devour.

00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:14.459
I'm so thankful that Satan could never cause us

00:36:14.459 --> 00:36:15.739
to go to hell.

00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:19.299
If you've been saved, if you've been born again,

00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:20.819
he can't take that.

00:36:20.819 --> 00:36:23.019
We have an inheritance.

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:24.079
He started it in chapter one

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:26.359
that's reserved in heaven for us.

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:30.059
But we understand that he's active.

00:36:30.059 --> 00:36:32.459
And we understand not only as we begin to think about

00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:34.419
how he's active and what he's doing,

00:36:34.419 --> 00:36:37.219
we'd understand that he is the accuser of the brethren.

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:39.579
We looked at Revelation 12, 12,

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:40.659
I quote a part of it to you,

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:42.079
but in verse number 10,

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:45.539
the Bible tells us that he is the accuser of the brethren.

00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:46.439
And he is.

00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:50.839
Maybe you have experienced times in which

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:53.139
the accuser of the brethren has knocked on your door.

00:36:53.139 --> 00:36:55.699
Maybe there are times in which you have experienced

00:36:55.699 --> 00:36:59.579
in which the one who seeks to devour the enemy

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:00.779
has knocked upon your door

00:37:00.779 --> 00:37:04.379
that that temptation comes in your life.

00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:06.099
As we begin to think about the truth

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:08.899
that Paul is giving to the believers in Colossae,

00:37:08.899 --> 00:37:11.739
how we ought to rejoice greatly to understand

00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:13.759
what it is that Christ did for sinners

00:37:13.759 --> 00:37:15.399
and what he did to Satan.

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:19.079
But we must be mindful that though he spoiled them

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:21.079
and he made a show of them openly,

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:22.799
triumphing over them in it,

00:37:22.799 --> 00:37:25.399
we understand that Satan is still active today.

00:37:25.399 --> 00:37:27.599
He is a defeated foe.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.719
It's amazing how a defeated foe

00:37:32.439 --> 00:37:35.299
can get a foothold that turns into a stronghold.

00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:39.399
We see it in the Word of God.

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:42.279
We find as the people of God,

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.319
as we try to take the truth of

00:37:44.319 --> 00:37:45.879
Colossians chapter number two

00:37:45.879 --> 00:37:48.919
and understand and rejoice in what Christ did for us

00:37:48.919 --> 00:37:51.039
and also have an understanding that

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:54.039
though Satan has been defeated at the cross of Calvary

00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:57.439
and though Satan has been rendered

00:37:57.439 --> 00:37:59.759
in this sense of the word spoiled,

00:37:59.759 --> 00:38:02.719
that there is this disarming or this neutralizing,

00:38:02.719 --> 00:38:04.679
we know that we cannot,

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:09.679
we cannot engage him in battle in our flesh.

00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:12.479
Can't.

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:16.759
And we understand that as the people of God,

00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:21.279
that we still have the flesh.

00:38:21.279 --> 00:38:22.719
How many of you are keenly aware of the fact

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:24.099
that you have a flesh?

00:38:25.159 --> 00:38:30.159
And that your flesh still has some level of desires?

00:38:31.399 --> 00:38:32.239
Right?

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.799
Paul talks about in the book of Ephesians

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:36.479
how that the flesh,

00:38:36.479 --> 00:38:37.879
excuse me, the book of Galatians,

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:40.919
that the flesh is at enmity with the Spirit.

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:41.759
Right?

00:38:41.759 --> 00:38:42.679
The flesh is at enmity.

00:38:42.679 --> 00:38:44.879
There's a battle that goes on.

00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:46.759
And so we understand this whole spiritual aspect

00:38:46.759 --> 00:38:47.679
of what's going on

00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:50.799
and we begin to think about as Bible believing Christians

00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:52.639
as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:56.719
and we can rejoice in some great promises of God's word

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:59.679
for when we engage with and we have that enemy

00:38:59.679 --> 00:39:01.279
that is the accuser, the brethren

00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:03.799
that's attacking and seeking to devour

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:06.159
that there are times in which we'll sin.

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:08.359
Have you ever sinned since you've been saved?

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:10.319
You laugh, why?

00:39:10.319 --> 00:39:11.759
Because we all have.

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:14.159
Some of you sinned this morning, amen?

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:15.879
I mean, in the parking lot maybe.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:26.159
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's word

00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:29.519
with regard to forgiveness.

00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:31.759
Take your Bibles under 1 John, if you will.

00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:36.119
I think about the biblical Christianity,

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:37.719
we think about biblical Christianity

00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:42.079
and there are so many pillars of biblical Christianity.

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.919
We speak about Baptist distinctives

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.639
and we talk about several of those

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:49.319
and what it is, why are you a Baptist?

00:39:49.319 --> 00:39:51.079
And you can answer those questions

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:53.479
and understand that first answer to that question

00:39:53.479 --> 00:39:56.079
would be that the word of God is the sole authority

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:57.399
for our faith and practice.

00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:59.479
And you can look at all the Baptist distinctives

00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:00.999
and kind of give you an idea.

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:04.079
as to what it is that a Baptist would believe and stand for.

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.599
But then we look at biblical Christianity

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:09.599
maybe a little bit broader from those Baptist distinctions

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:13.159
and say, what are some pillars of biblical Christianity?

00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:14.999
And there are a lot of them.

00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:16.799
But I would submit to you this morning

00:40:16.799 --> 00:40:22.319
that two of those are forgiveness and restoration.

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.719
And for that, I am thankful.

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:28.079
Notice what John says here in 1 John chapter 1.

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:31.319
Again, we would understand even as we made reference

00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:36.959
in the book of 1 Peter that John is writing to believers

00:40:36.959 --> 00:40:39.639
the same way that Peter was writing to believers.

00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:41.479
And as he's writing to these believers

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:45.079
in the book of 1 John, he says to them in verse number 8,

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:49.639
if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:52.359
And the truth is not in us.

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:56.999
But notice this great promise in verse number 9.

00:40:56.999 --> 00:41:00.759
If we confess our sins,

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:06.919
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

00:41:06.919 --> 00:41:11.359
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:12.959
If we say that we have not sinned,

00:41:12.959 --> 00:41:14.959
we make Him a liar,

00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:17.599
and His Word is not in us.

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:21.799
I know that we're so thankful for the promise of 1 John 1.9.

00:41:21.799 --> 00:41:25.799
Mr. Don often will say 1 John 1.9.

00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:29.559
He's speaking of this promise that God offers.

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:31.759
Listen, remember the Old Testament reveals to us

00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:34.359
that God is plenteous in mercy.

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:36.279
That He is ready to pardon.

00:41:36.279 --> 00:41:39.279
That He is ready to forgive.

00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:41.599
We read into chapter number 2 here of 1 John,

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.279
and the Bible says,

00:41:42.279 --> 00:41:46.239
My little children, these things write I unto you,

00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:50.039
that ye sin not.

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:52.719
But then it says this, and if any man sin,

00:41:52.759 --> 00:41:56.039
listen, it is desirous that we sin not.

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:57.079
Amen?

00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:58.399
The closer we get to the Lord,

00:41:58.399 --> 00:41:59.879
the more we walk with God,

00:41:59.879 --> 00:42:04.719
the less we ought to be sinning.

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:06.079
Amen?

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:07.519
The desire is that we'd sin not,

00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:10.279
but understand, contrary to what some people taught

00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:11.679
hundreds of years ago,

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:16.039
you're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:17.839
It's just not going to happen

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:20.279
until we get to glory.

00:42:20.279 --> 00:42:21.999
Amen?

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.559
When this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:28.279
when this corruption shall put on incorruption,

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:31.199
then, and only then,

00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:33.639
will I no longer have a flesh

00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:35.879
that will cause me to sin.

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:38.519
The enemy, right?

00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:39.839
The way in which he comes.

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:42.759
And so, I guess if you want to call it

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:44.119
charge from John,

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:45.519
it is to sin not,

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:46.519
but then he says this,

00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:48.599
see, I'm thankful for every word of God.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.879
I'm thankful for the entirety of the Word of God,

00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:52.319
because he says that you sin not,

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.799
but knowing and understanding,

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:55.759
even as we've read in chapter number one,

00:42:55.759 --> 00:42:58.679
that we are sinners and we are going to sin.

00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:02.199
He says, and if any man sin,

00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:04.159
all of us,

00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:08.839
we have an advocate with the Father,

00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:12.359
Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:16.319
Aren't you thankful that you have an advocate?

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:20.039
Because you have an accuser of the brethren.

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:22.399
You have an accuser.

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:24.439
But you have an advocate.

00:43:24.439 --> 00:43:26.239
You have an advocate.

00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:28.359
And I'm thankful that when the advocate

00:43:28.359 --> 00:43:31.479
stands up on our behalf,

00:43:31.479 --> 00:43:33.799
that he can say something like this,

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:37.879
I paid for that.

00:43:37.879 --> 00:43:40.639
I paid for that.

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:43.039
Amen?

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:45.599
And if we confess our sins,

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:46.719
He forgives us.

00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:49.519
He says that He removes them as far as the east

00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:50.959
from the west.

00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:53.479
That they're buried in the deepest sea.

00:43:53.479 --> 00:43:54.599
Amen?

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:56.199
We believe the Word of God.

00:43:56.199 --> 00:43:57.559
And see, as we look at the whole,

00:43:57.559 --> 00:43:59.039
I'm thankful for the book of Colossians.

00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:00.439
Trust me, as we're studying through it,

00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:02.399
I'm encouraged and I'm strengthened and I'm helped.

00:44:02.399 --> 00:44:04.639
I'm so thankful for what Christ did

00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:06.319
for sinners at Calvary.

00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:08.159
As Paul would share with these believers,

00:44:08.159 --> 00:44:09.879
let me help you understand

00:44:09.879 --> 00:44:11.519
that you are complete in Christ.

00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:12.919
Let me help you understand

00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:14.439
that these false teachers are coming

00:44:14.439 --> 00:44:16.679
and saying that you need something more than Christ.

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:18.959
They wouldn't say you don't need Christ,

00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:20.679
but you need something more in addition to

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:23.079
to reach higher planes and so on and so forth.

00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:25.719
But Paul says, listen, Christ is all we need.

00:44:25.719 --> 00:44:27.359
You're complete in Christ.

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:30.919
Here's what He accomplished at Calvary for sinners.

00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:34.639
And here's what He did to Satan at Calvary.

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:36.999
But as we have the whole of the Bible,

00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:43.679
and we understand that Satan was defeated foe,

00:44:43.679 --> 00:44:49.799
that God has allowed him to have some level of reign

00:44:49.799 --> 00:44:53.039
in this particular era.

00:44:53.039 --> 00:44:54.759
We may not like it,

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:58.199
but we better learn the truth of it.

00:44:58.199 --> 00:45:00.159
And he's the accuser of the brethren

00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:03.919
and he's seeking whom he may devour.

00:45:03.919 --> 00:45:05.359
But as the accuser of the brethren

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.919
and as the one that's seeking whom he may devour,

00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:12.639
I'm thankful that if we sin or when we sin,

00:45:12.759 --> 00:45:14.919
that we have an advocate.

00:45:14.919 --> 00:45:17.639
An advocate with the Father.

00:45:17.639 --> 00:45:20.759
This morning, I hope that we can rejoice greatly

00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:22.679
in understanding what Paul explains

00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:24.199
to the believers in Colossae

00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:26.079
with regard to what Christ accomplished

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.319
at the cross of Calvary.

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.319
If you're here this morning

00:45:29.319 --> 00:45:33.279
and you've never trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:45:33.279 --> 00:45:34.439
maybe when we were singing,

00:45:34.439 --> 00:45:37.199
are you washed in the blood?

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:40.759
You're not able to answer with confidence

00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:43.559
that you've been saved, that you've been born again.

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:46.719
Today is the day of salvation.

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:48.319
Today is the day of salvation.

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:50.879
The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior

00:45:50.879 --> 00:45:53.279
and He wants to save you.

00:45:53.279 --> 00:45:55.719
But for us as the people of God,

00:45:55.719 --> 00:46:00.039
would we rejoice in what Christ accomplished?

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:04.479
But also be mindful of the battle that still continues.

00:46:04.479 --> 00:46:05.399
It's often been said,

00:46:05.399 --> 00:46:08.479
in fact, I've mentioned it on a number of occasions.

00:46:08.479 --> 00:46:09.559
As you read through the book of Romans,

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:12.039
you'll see it in particular,

00:46:12.039 --> 00:46:13.839
that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:16.759
He delivered us from the penalty of sin.

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:17.959
What's the penalty of sin?

00:46:17.959 --> 00:46:19.279
Death.

00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:21.279
The wage of sin is death, right?

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.159
And He delivered us from the penalty of sin.

00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:25.959
He's delivered us from the power of sin.

00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:29.759
Sin should no longer have dominion over you.

00:46:29.759 --> 00:46:31.239
But we've not yet been delivered

00:46:31.239 --> 00:46:35.239
from the presence of sin.

00:46:35.239 --> 00:46:38.199
And we find that this great Bible truth,

00:46:38.199 --> 00:46:39.919
this great biblical principle,

00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:44.919
this biblical principle for Christianity,

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:47.359
is that we believe in the pillar

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:49.879
of forgiveness and restoration.

00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:53.719
And we understand that with,

00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:54.719
as a child of God,

00:46:54.719 --> 00:46:57.079
that I have an advocate

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:58.999
that stands on my behalf.

00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:00.719
You think about the legal terminology

00:47:00.719 --> 00:47:02.919
and the legal understanding here,

00:47:02.919 --> 00:47:05.799
that this advocate stands on my behalf.

00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:07.079
And because we understand the truth

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:09.119
of substitutionary atonement,

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.119
He took my place.

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.679
He took my place.

00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:14.399
And He took your place.

00:47:14.399 --> 00:47:17.879
Nailing it to His cross.

00:47:17.879 --> 00:47:22.039
I'm so thankful for what Christ did for us at Calvary.

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:22.879
Let's pray.

00:47:22.879 --> 00:47:25.159
Father, how we love You this morning

00:47:25.159 --> 00:47:28.639
and how we thank You for Your Word.

00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:33.679
We thank You for that which was accomplished

00:47:33.679 --> 00:47:35.319
over 2,000 years ago there

00:47:35.479 --> 00:47:39.079
at the cross of Calvary.

00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:40.679
We thank You for what You did for sinners

00:47:40.679 --> 00:47:45.079
and for what You did to Satan.

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:47.959
And God, as we walk with You,

00:47:47.959 --> 00:47:50.079
I pray that You'd help us to walk in the Spirit

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:53.599
so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:58.359
Help us, God, to be mindful that we have an enemy

00:47:58.359 --> 00:48:00.359
that seeks to devour,

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:03.759
that is the accuser of the brethren.

00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:05.799
And I pray that You'd help us to rejoice greatly

00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:08.679
in knowing that we have an advocate with the Father,

00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:11.039
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:48:11.039 --> 00:48:15.199
I pray, God, that You would help us

00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:18.639
to rejoice in that truth.

00:48:18.639 --> 00:48:20.799
If there's one that's not sure of heaven,

00:48:20.799 --> 00:48:23.639
it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:25.599
The Holy Spirit of God would use the Word of God

00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:29.959
to convict and convince of sin,

00:48:29.959 --> 00:48:33.359
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:36.919
We pray that as we have a time of invitation,

00:48:36.919 --> 00:48:40.399
that, Lord, You would work as only You can.

00:48:40.399 --> 00:48:44.719
You would move, help us, Lord, to be responsive.

00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:47.799
We pray that You'd be glorified through each decision.

00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:48.999
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:48.999 --> 00:48:49.919
Would You stand with me?

00:48:49.919 --> 00:48:51.919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:51.919 --> 00:48:54.839
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:57.119
And as she does, the altar is open.

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:57.959
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:48:57.959 --> 00:48:59.079
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

00:48:59.079 --> 00:49:01.639
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:05.679
Maybe you just need to come and ask the Lord to help you

00:49:05.679 --> 00:49:07.359
as you walk this Christian life,

00:49:07.359 --> 00:49:10.319
knowing that we have an adversary.

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:12.359
Maybe there's some sin that you need to come confess

00:49:12.359 --> 00:49:15.839
and get that forgiveness and understand

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:17.559
that you have an advocate with the Father.

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:19.679
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
