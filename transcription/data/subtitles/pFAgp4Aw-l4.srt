1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Here in Mark chapter number five as we look at this passage of scripture this evening

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,479
I want to deal with the subject matter really the passage that we're looking at will record for us the

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:16,280
great miracle that took place the maniac Gadara and

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:22,399
This man's conversion and what-have-you and as we look at this passage of scripture

5
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,280
I want to read verse 19 to you and give you the

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,319
Titling kind of get into the message this evening in Mark 5 in verse number 19

7
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:33,439
The Bible says how be it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:42,040
Go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and hath

9
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,479
had compassion on

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,860
Thee I'm gonna preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled go and tell

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,259
Go and tell now as I was preparing the message and thinking about that title

12
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:03,860
I was reminded of days in grade school when we had show and tell let me remember show and tell

13
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,819
Yeah, somebody remember that right and you'd have show and tell and it wasn't very often. I don't remember

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,660
Having show and tell on a regular basis

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,099
in fact

16
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:13,620
I

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,620
tried to

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,620
in my mind remember some of the things that some of my

19
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:22,180
Classmates brought some of the things that I took for show-and-tell and I was coming up with a blank

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,739
And so it seems as if nothing was too, you know that life

21
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,139
impactful at a show-and-tell

22
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:32,900
In my elementary days in grade school

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,379
however

24
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,059
I know that what would happen is we'd go to school and really was kind of an exciting day and

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,980
You would go and you would prepare for what is it that I'm gonna take and you'd bring something in and you would show

26
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:50,459
Your classmates whatever that object was and then you would tell them about it and

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,860
No doubt there were times in which you'd try to find something that was unique

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,660
right something that not everybody else in the class would have and be familiar with and

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,779
want to take them something that was unique that you could show them and maybe be proud of and what have you and

30
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:11,059
you'd have the show-and-tell and you'd hear all of the students and what have you as

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:18,580
We think about the times in in grade school of show-and-tell and we think about those funny memories

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,559
I'm thinking this evening about the passage that is before us and the

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,339
Instruction that the Lord Jesus Christ gives to this man. He doesn't tell him to show and tell

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,899
In fact in Luke, he tells him to go and show them great things that the Lord has done

35
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:39,419
But here as it's recorded in Mark, he says go and tell

36
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:45,199
As I think about that message that Jesus gives to this man at Gadara

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,139
this maniac that had experienced the power of God a

38
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,899
mindful this evening of the

39
00:02:53,899 --> 00:03:00,259
Responsibility that has been given to each of us as the people of God the children of God to go and tell

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,539
to go and tell

41
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:08,059
The reality this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture were reminded of the power of God

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,460
I'm so thankful that the our God is omnipotent that he has all power

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,039
I'm thankful that he did not simply declare to us that he has all power though

44
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,779
He did we find that he's demonstrated on a number of occasions throughout his word his great power

45
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:28,660
In fact as you read through the gospel accounts and you read the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ

46
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,899
You find how that he's demonstrating his power over various things. He demonstrates his power over nature

47
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:38,619
He demonstrates his power over disease. He demonstrates his power

48
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,820
Such as this passage of Scripture over the demons and I'm so thankful that our God has all power

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,500
And he demonstrated that power we think about the miracles of Christ

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,139
And of course we can think about the miracles of the Bible in its entirety and you can see the power of God demonstrated

51
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,820
But you think about the impact that those miracles had not only on the ones that were the recipients

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,779
Personally of the the power of God, but those that saw those that were eyewitnesses of what God did

53
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,419
the power of God

54
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:15,100
We find in this passage of Scripture. The Bible begins in verse number one and

55
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,660
it says and they

56
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,540
Came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the Gadarenes now

57
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,600
It's interesting because Jesus is with his disciples

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,119
And if you read the latter part of chapter number four, you find one of those

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Instances in which the Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated his power over nature

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,920
It was there when they were in the midst of a storm and Jesus was asleep on a pillow and they came to him saying master

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,559
Carest thou not that we perish and we find that it was Jesus in this particular account that he stands and he says peace

62
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:56,600
Be still the Bible tells us that the wind ceased and there was a great calm

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,760
He then says to them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith they

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,839
Were fearing exceedingly they said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea?

65
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,519
obey him

66
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,559
this was a a

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,480
Week in which they had experienced many amazing things much teaching and

68
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,480
many miracles

69
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
We find that we come to

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,160
chapter number five and we know that the chapter divisions are there for us and the Bible says that they came over under the other

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,700
side of the sea

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,679
They were instructed to pass over to the other side in verse number 35 of chapter number four

73
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,440
It says the same day when the even was come he says unto them

74
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,959
Let us pass over under the other side. There was a purpose for them crossing the sea

75
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:52,540
There was a purpose for them going to the the country of the Gatorades and that purpose was to meet this man that the

76
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,359
passage of Scripture deals with in its entirety and we find that this

77
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:03,519
Encounter is recorded for us and really in the first 18 verses of the chapter

78
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,040
We find if you were to take notes this evening

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,880
The man was converted and it's a lengthy passage that shares with us all of the interaction and all that takes place

80
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,160
The Bible tells us that when they got they arrived there to the country of the Gatorades

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,799
It says in verse number two and when he was come out of the ship

82
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,600
Immediately there met him out of the tombs a man

83
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,799
with an unclean spirit

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,519
And the Bible tells us of this interaction that this man with this unclean spirit

85
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,160
We often would refer to him as the maniac of Gadara that this man

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Immediately upon the Lord Jesus Christ God in flesh

87
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,720
coming off of that ship this man meets him and the Bible tells us in verse 3 and

88
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Following some things about this man some of his characteristics and some of his

89
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,920
Behavior it says who had his dwelling among the tombs

90
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,359
And no man could bind him. No not with chains

91
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:10,040
Because they had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in

92
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,640
pieces neither

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Could any man?

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
tame him

95
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,119
And always

96
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:21,920
Night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs

97
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,799
crying and cutting himself

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
with stones

99
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:33,399
The picture that is painted of this man's behavior some of his characteristics in verses 3 through 5

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,880
Really would lead us to a place where you say I wouldn't like to meet that fella

101
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Amen

102
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,359
Not someone that I would like to meet

103
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,480
Not someone I care to have interaction with we find the Bible says in verse number 6

104
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,000
But when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,839
And cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus now son of the Most High God I

106
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,600
Adjure thee by God that thou torment me not

107
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,399
It's interesting. We've often said as you read through the gospel accounts the truth that the demons they understand who Jesus is

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,399
They know that he is God. They know

109
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,399
Who he is. In fact, you find that here they say to torment me not they

110
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,519
Understand the the plan of God they understand listen the devil knows that his time is short

111
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:33,200
the devil knows that he's gonna be cast in the lake of fire and he's gonna be tormented day and night forever and ever and

112
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,119
these

113
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:43,359
Demons here that had indwelled this particular man that possessed this man. They understand who Jesus is

114
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:49,000
The Bible tells us and James that the devils believe and

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,080
Tremble they know who Jesus is

116
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:01,119
Verse number 8 it says for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he Jesus asked him

117
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,640
What is?

118
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
thy name and

119
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,320
He answered saying my name is legion

120
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,239
for we are many

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now

122
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,239
There was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils besought him saying send us

123
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,840
into the swine that we may enter into them and

124
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,880
forthwith Jesus gave them leave

125
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,119
The unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea

126
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,679
there were about

127
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,679
2,000 and were choked in the sea and

128
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,440
They that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was

129
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,799
That was done. Now. I want you to consider put yourself in the place here in Gadara

130
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,320
If you will and understand what is happening as we find that Jesus and his disciples have crossed over

131
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,479
The sea as it's recorded for us at the end of chapter before and they arrived

132
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,239
into the country of the Gadarenes and we find

133
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,979
that as they begin to get off of the ship,

134
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,679
that this man that no doubt

135
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,099
they knew about this man

136
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,439
that had an unclean spirit.

137
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,499
The Bible tells us

138
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,339
that neither could any man tame him.

139
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,679
The Bible tells us that he was often

140
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,899
bound with fetters and chains.

141
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,939
And we understand that this man,

142
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:22,699
the people of Gadar had some knowledge of this man.

143
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,379
And they see what's happening

144
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,579
and the Bible tells us

145
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,979
that as the Lord Jesus Christ

146
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:31,179
is having interaction with this demon-possessed man,

147
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,559
he's speaking to the demon specifically.

148
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,079
And he says, what is thy name?

149
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,619
And the answer comes

150
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,719
and you find that they make a request.

151
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,919
They beseech the Lord

152
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,719
that they would not send them out away into the country.

153
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:50,239
They had this desire to enter into the swine.

154
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,399
And Jesus gave them leave in v. 13.

155
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,399
And what that reveals to us is again

156
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,719
that Jesus has all power.

157
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:02,699
Again, the demons did not have the choice

158
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,699
as to what they did or where they went

159
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:05,859
and how they went.

160
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:08,139
We find that Jesus gave them leave.

161
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,139
Jesus allowed this to happen.

162
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,639
He permitted it to happen.

163
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,879
Of course, we'd understand

164
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,379
with the Jewish culture

165
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,259
and the dietary restrictions

166
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,479
and all of those things,

167
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,939
though this particular region

168
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,939
would have been more Gentile than Jewish,

169
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,439
we find that no doubt

170
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,699
there were some things that were taking place

171
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,019
with the raising of these swine and what have you,

172
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,479
and Jesus would allow them, these demons,

173
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:38,399
to have the opportunity to go into these swine.

174
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,819
The Bible tells us that they entered into the swine

175
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,499
and notice what happens.

176
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:47,019
The herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea.

177
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,279
But the Bible tells us something interesting

178
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,579
in v. 14, it says,

179
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:56,079
and they that fed the swine fled.

180
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
They were holding it in the city, in the country,

181
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,659
and they went out to see what it was that was done.

182
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,779
There's some people that observe what took place.

183
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,499
They saw these swine that were over there

184
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,179
and I'm not sure how they were behaving

185
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,519
prior to these demons entering into them,

186
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,939
but as soon as these demons were cast out of this man

187
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,379
and entered into those swine,

188
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,339
the Bible tells us that they ran violently

189
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,679
down a steep,

190
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,039
and we find that they were choked in the sea.

191
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,439
They died. They ran violently.

192
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,079
They saw it and they went and they told some people.

193
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,779
They let them know what had happened.

194
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,199
And it's interesting that it says

195
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,459
they went out to see what was that was done.

196
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,919
Whoever it is that these that fed the swine,

197
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,399
whoever they told in the city and in the country,

198
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,799
there was a group of people that came back.

199
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,639
I want you to think about it in your mind's eye.

200
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,179
Put yourself there again

201
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,599
and understand what's happening

202
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,419
as the report had been given.

203
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,499
It's mindful as you look at various portions of Scripture

204
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,459
and you see how there are times

205
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,299
in which people would go

206
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,859
and share truth with others to bring them.

207
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:14,059
I think about the situation in John 4

208
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,259
when Jesus said, I must go through.

209
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,259
I must pass through Samaria.

210
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,319
And He meets the woman of the well.

211
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,399
And you remember that after that interaction,

212
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,199
she goes back and says,

213
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:29,079
come, see a man that told me all things ever I've done.

214
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,319
And there's a great host of people

215
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:34,039
that come back to where Jesus is

216
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,679
in John 4.

217
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,879
The Bible tells us in that passage of Scripture

218
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,239
that there were some that believed

219
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,339
because of the testimony of the woman.

220
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,319
But the Bible tells us that there were

221
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,879
a great number of people,

222
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,859
many more that believed

223
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,679
because of His own Word.

224
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,599
He spent two days teaching those people

225
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,259
that came back in John 4.

226
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,999
And here in Mark 5,

227
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:59,439
we're not told of the size of the crowd that returns,

228
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,799
but we find that as they would return

229
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,639
to the place in which these

230
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,119
that had fed the swine told them of,

231
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,579
that they came,

232
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,979
and notice what it tells us in v. 15,

233
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,279
and they come to Jesus,

234
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,839
and notice what it says,

235
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,619
and see Him that was possessed

236
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:22,779
with the devil and had the legion.

237
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,979
What does it tell us?

238
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,819
They see this man sitting

239
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:30,019
and clothed

240
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,440
and in his right mind.

241
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,339
And they were afraid.

242
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,259
There's a great change

243
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,059
in the life of this individual.

244
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,739
We find there's a great contrast

245
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:44,739
in v. 15 to what we read in v. 3-5

246
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,279
with regard to the characteristics of this man

247
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,359
and his behavior.

248
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,119
And we find now that this man

249
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,679
who had been in this situation

250
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,599
where he was dwelling among the tombs,

251
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,039
where he was not able to be bound,

252
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,759
this man now is sitting at the feet of Jesus.

253
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,639
He's clothed in his right mind.

254
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,419
No doubt, the people are perplexed.

255
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,759
No doubt, they've heard from these

256
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,399
that fed the swine what had taken place,

257
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,720
and they come and they see this scene.

258
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,419
And the Bible says that they were sore afraid.

259
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,799
They were sore afraid.

260
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,440
It says, "...and they that saw it told them

261
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,479
how it befell to him that was possessed

262
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:32,000
with the devil and also concerning the swine."

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,919
It's interesting as we begin to see

264
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,119
what's happening here in Mark 5

265
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,000
in the account that is given to us,

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,319
and we begin to see how these people

267
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,160
are just receiving this information,

268
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,880
but it's sad how they respond

269
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,559
to the information that they receive.

270
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,239
This man that had no doubt

271
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,479
had some level of being a nuisance

272
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,720
and they tried to bind him

273
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,199
and all of these things,

274
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
and now the man is sitting in cloth

275
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,799
in his right mind.

276
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,679
And Luke would tell us that he's sitting

277
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,919
at the feet of Jesus.

278
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,720
No doubt, he's being instructed

279
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,559
and he's receiving the truth

280
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,919
of the Word of God.

281
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,959
And we find here that the people

282
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,239
receive this message,

283
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,199
but they respond in this manner

284
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,359
in verse 17.

285
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,399
"...they began to pray him

286
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,880
to depart out of their coast."

287
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,639
Really what the Scriptures are telling us

288
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,799
is they wanted Jesus to leave.

289
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,599
They wanted Jesus to leave.

290
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:36,839
That He would depart out of their coast.

291
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,160
And then the Bible tells us this,

292
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,880
"...and when He was come into the ship,

293
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,319
that He is Jesus."

294
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,880
It then tells us that He that had been

295
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,639
possessed with the devil,

296
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,759
prayed Him that He might be with Him.

297
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,359
Now, as a side note,

298
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,399
as we would consider even as we looked

299
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
in the book of Hebrews not long ago,

300
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,199
and we dealt with some of those things

301
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,639
that should accompany salvation.

302
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,720
We speak about some birthmarks of the believer.

303
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,919
The reality is that as we are believers,

304
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,359
as our souls, we get saved

305
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,559
and we're born again

306
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,239
and we have that transformation,

307
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:20,959
we ought to desire to be with Him.

308
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,119
And we find here that this man,

309
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,440
as Jesus is going to depart,

310
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,519
He's come to Gadara for just a short period of time.

311
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,160
He came there for a purpose

312
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,759
and we find that the people of the city,

313
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,239
they begin to pray Him to depart out of their coast

314
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,479
and Jesus is getting onto the ship

315
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,160
and as He's planning to leave,

316
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,359
this one that was possessed of the devil

317
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,639
prayed Him that He might be with Him.

318
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,759
Now, I don't blame the guy for wanting to go with Jesus.

319
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,519
Do you?

320
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,440
If they wanted Jesus to leave

321
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,679
and this man had experienced the power of Christ

322
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,199
and he had experienced this transformation,

323
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:01,319
he wants to be with Jesus.

324
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,839
I think it's commendable.

325
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,319
But Jesus tells them no.

326
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,119
Jesus tells them no.

327
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,799
It's not because Jesus didn't want Him to be with them.

328
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,039
It's because Jesus was leaving a witness behind.

329
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,880
We find that the Bible says in v. 19,

330
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,839
how be it Jesus suffered Him not.

331
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,160
He didn't allow Him to come.

332
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,399
And then He gives them some instruction.

333
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,200
We see that the man was converted.

334
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,559
We now see that the man is commissioned.

335
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,080
I love the direct nature of what Jesus says to this man.

336
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,640
Again, Jesus has been there

337
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,839
and He's given some instruction.

338
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,559
The man wants to go to be with them.

339
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,640
And Jesus allows him not,

340
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,599
but gives him a commission.

341
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,080
He says this,

342
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,119
go home to thy friends

343
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,919
and tell them how great things

344
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,520
the Lord hath done for thee

345
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,320
and hath had compassion on thee.

346
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,119
Go and tell.

347
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,239
He told them where to go.

348
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,479
And He told them what to tell them.

349
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,679
Amen?

350
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,559
He had experienced something.

351
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
By the way, I mentioned this morning

352
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
as we referenced a portion of Scripture in Acts 16

353
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
that the message of that girl

354
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,440
that was possessed with a spirit of divination

355
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
that she was giving the right message,

356
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,119
but it was the wrong vessel.

357
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,479
Now we have a man that has been transformed.

358
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,679
He's been born again.

359
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,239
He's been converted.

360
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,880
And now, he is given the responsibility

361
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,839
to go and tell.

362
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,000
Go home to thy friends.

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
There was a responsibility

364
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,039
that was laid upon this individual.

365
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,080
This man that we often refer to

366
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,239
as the maniac of Gadara,

367
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,320
he was given this great responsibility.

368
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,320
and he was given this commission to go home to his friends and he's told to

369
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,560
tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee I wonder this morning this

370
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,480
evening it's not morning anymore I wonder this evening has God done great

371
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:28,880
things for you I've been so good to us the truth of redemption the the miracle

372
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,960
of redemption the fact that I was lost and on my way to a Christless eternity

373
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,520
the book of Ephesians the Apostle Paul he deals with it this way that we have

374
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:52,240
no hope right we're strangers we have no hope but yet receive that message of the

375
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,640
gospel of Jesus Christ and we find that he's done great things for us the

376
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,480
truth of conversion it says and have had compassion on thee we often speak of the

377
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,560
fact that our Lord is compassionate I'm thankful that Jeremiah said his

378
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,960
compassions they fail not I'm thankful that often as you read the gospel

379
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,440
accounts you find that the Lord Jesus Christ is moved with compassion in fact

380
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,140
in the passage of Scripture in Matthew chapter 9 a passage a passage that we

381
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,380
often reference about the harvest being plenteous and the labors being few the

382
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,780
Bible tells us in verse number 36 of that portion of Scripture that when he

383
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,580
Jesus saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them why because they

384
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,860
fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he

385
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,400
unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labors are few pray

386
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,520
therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his

387
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,960
harvest and here in our passage in Mark chapter number five this man has a

388
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,800
desire to depart to be with the Lord and Jesus suffered him not he allowed him

389
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,920
not but he gave him some very important direction the responsibility that is

390
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,760
laid upon this man is responsibility that he gladly accepted we see that

391
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,080
through his actions as is recorded in verse number 20 the Bible says and he

392
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,760
departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had

393
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:44,240
done for him and then the Bible says this and all men did marvel as we look

394
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,920
at the account that is before us this evening and we consider the the

395
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,560
commission that was given to this individual and we understand that Jesus

396
00:22:53,560 --> 00:23:00,160
gave him specific instruction as to where to go and what to tell and how to

397
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,400
communicate these things to those that he would come into contact with it the

398
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,200
man immediately he received the instruction and he obeyed he departed

399
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,800
and began to publish I like the way that the Bible records for us how the man

400
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,560
just simply submitted to the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ okay this is

401
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:31,080
what you're leaving me to do I'll do it and the Bible says that he did exactly

402
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,520
as he was told he departed Jesus said go and he began to publish Jesus said tell

403
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,320
and he published in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him see this

404
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,640
evening God's done some great things for us I've often found not so much in

405
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,680
recent weeks or months but in time before Kovat is there was more

406
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,600
interaction and more opportunity to go out and speak with individuals and even

407
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,600
during this time of Kovat there have been unique opportunities just not as

408
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:16,360
many we find that it's my approach has changed slightly and the fact that as I

409
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,760
begin to speak with individuals I asked him if I can share with them what Jesus

410
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,279
did has done for me can I tell you what he's done for me can I tell you how he

411
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,040
changed my life can I tell you how and all of a sudden it's it's a different

412
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,240
response Joseph you've been door-knocking with me for years Joseph

413
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,720
been my partner and there's other folks that I've gone door-knocking with but

414
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,720
I've taken Joseph door-knocking many many many times and Holly will go with

415
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,720
the girls and they're always asked hey are you guys sisters and Joseph used to

416
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,360
say daddy why doesn't anyone ever think we're brothers I'll leave it alone amen

417
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
he's getting older now so I don't know I mean if he shaves his hair a little

418
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,559
shorter maybe somebody will I don't know in any case there have been times that

419
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:11,520
he's no doubt experienced as he's heard the interactions or the people that hey

420
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,119
my name is so-and-so you know go hey I don't ever introduce myself as pastor I

421
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,480
am Chris this is Joseph for Fellowship Baptist Church I'd like to invite you to

422
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,520
church you know any people accept that that's okay we're good honestly right how

423
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,839
many people we say that to all the time there was one day I can't remember the

424
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,360
exact day I probably have it in a note down in my office but I took a different

425
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,880
approach I said hi my name is Chris my son Joseph can I tell you how God

426
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,200
changed my life I like to share with you what Jesus has done for me you know that

427
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,320
on that day I had opportunity to speak more deeply with more people in one day

428
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:03,160
than I had in weeks combined of door-knocking here's a thought when I

429
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,960
invite somebody to church they already kind of have an idea of what church is

430
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,440
like they've already had in their mind perhaps an experience with church maybe

431
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,520
a bad experience I'm not going to church church is boring churches whatever they

432
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,720
think right whatever their experience has been whatever's led to their

433
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,760
conclusion with regard to church so immediately as I say I'd like to invite

434
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,520
you to church there's a certain something that takes place in them when

435
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:40,240
they hear those words but if I say to them can I tell you how God's changed my

436
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,600
life can I tell you how he's given me hope can I tell you how he's given me a

437
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,839
peace can I tell you all of a sudden there's man people don't have that stuff

438
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,720
people are looking for that and all of a sudden you have an opportunity to be

439
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:04,679
able to start sharing the great things that he God has done for me and the

440
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,480
Bible says all men did marvel I wonder in the last I don't know generation or

441
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,880
two in our churches where we have had so much impact sorry instruction wrong word

442
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,679
so much instruction on how to go so winning quote-unquote and we memorize

443
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,080
our little script as to what we're going to say and we go through our little

444
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,520
verses and I'm not I'm not seeking to be unkind but typically in that memorized

445
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:48,000
kind of sales pitch ish kind of a thing how many people have been turned off

446
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:57,399
Jesus told this man to go and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for

447
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:05,440
thee so I wonder this evening if we take the approach of not so much just trying

448
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,320
to go through some memorized script of how I'm supposed to invite somebody to

449
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,800
come and to visit our church and this that and the other thing is if I begin

450
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,880
to approach it in the manner of can I tell you what he's done for me can I

451
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,960
tell you how he changed my life because here's the amazing thing you have the

452
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,559
testimony of a transformed life this you don't have this guy's testimony amen you

453
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,400
know it's his testimony you don't have my testimony and I don't have your

454
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,720
testimony but you have a testimony I know it's amazing is that you can

455
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,000
speak passionately about what Christ has done for you why cuz it's real amen

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,080
and you're not talking about what he's done for somebody else though we can

457
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,400
maybe use some examples but you're talking about what he's done for you and

458
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,280
when you talk about what he's done for you and they see that it's genuine they

459
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,320
see that it's real have you ever dealt with some salespeople that you're just

460
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,559
like man this guy is just he is a sales guy right I don't want to be that guy

461
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,239
knocking on somebody's door I'm not trying to sell somebody the gospel it's

462
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:25,720
not for sale you can't buy it amen and so I don't want someone to get the

463
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,359
impression that I'm just going through some little you know sales pitch but let

464
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,559
me tell you what he's done for me let me tell you changes my life so I don't know

465
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:43,720
if you can remember when you were lost I can remember when I was lost I can

466
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,919
remember when I didn't have the peace that I have today I can remember when I

467
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,479
didn't have the purpose that I have today I can remember and I know that you

468
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:57,520
can remember as well most many of you and when you can remember those things

469
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,479
begin to share that and you say let me tell you what he's

470
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,239
is done for me,

471
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:08,019
and the impact that that can make on others.

472
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,939
All men did marvel.

473
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,199
I want to share with you,

474
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:22,599
go over to Luke 1 if you will.

475
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,279
It's a slightly different context

476
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,319
as to what is taking place here.

477
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,879
But I want you to read and hear the words,

478
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:33,019
the testimony that is given here.

479
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,679
We begin looking in verse 41.

480
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,219
It came to pass that when Elizabeth

481
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,659
heard the salutation of Mary,

482
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,059
the babe leaped in her womb,

483
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,339
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.

484
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,979
And she spake out with a loud voice and said,

485
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:45,499
Blessed art thou among women,

486
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,939
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

487
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,139
And whence is this to me,

488
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,099
that the mother of my Lord

489
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,859
should come to me?

490
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,579
For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation

491
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,819
sounded in mine ears,

492
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:00,299
the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

493
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,739
And blessed is she that believed,

494
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,099
and there shall be a performance of those things

495
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,099
which were told her from the Lord.

496
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,099
And look at what Mary says.

497
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:11,859
Verse 46,

498
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:15,619
My soul doth magnify the Lord,

499
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,499
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.

500
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:21,739
For He hath regarded the low state of His handmaiden,

501
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,699
for behold, from henceforth all generations

502
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,819
shall call me blessed.

503
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,459
For He that is mighty

504
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,139
hath done to me great things,

505
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:35,099
and holy is His name.

506
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:37,739
I understand contextually what Mary is speaking of

507
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:40,099
is different than what we're dealing with this evening,

508
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,379
but I'd like to adopt the words of verse 49

509
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,099
and apply them to our lives

510
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,219
as far as conversion is concerned.

511
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:50,219
And I'd like to say that He that is mighty

512
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:53,499
hath done to me great things,

513
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:57,179
and holy is His name.

514
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,019
And I have the opportunity, the privilege

515
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:01,179
of being His representative.

516
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:02,339
And the thing that's amazing

517
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,579
is that in this particular account,

518
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,659
in Mark 5 that we're studying this evening,

519
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,179
the reality is that Jesus had not yet gone

520
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,579
to the cross of Calvary.

521
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:16,139
Jesus had not yet been in the tomb for those three days.

522
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:17,699
He'd not yet ascended,

523
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:20,179
raised from the dead and then ascended to heaven.

524
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:24,899
But we find that now as those events

525
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,699
are historically past,

526
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:30,219
that Jesus has paid for the sin of mankind

527
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:32,739
by going to the cross of Calvary.

528
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:33,659
He's been buried.

529
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:34,979
He's risen from the dead.

530
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:36,979
He's conquered sin, death, and the grave.

531
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:38,579
He's ascended into heaven.

532
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,339
And He's done something miraculous

533
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:41,819
in the fact that He's given us

534
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,939
the Holy Spirit of God.

535
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:48,139
And in so doing, He says this

536
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:49,659
when He gives the Great Commission

537
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:51,459
in Matthew 28,

538
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:56,179
in lo, I am with you always.

539
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,739
And so here's the amazing thing

540
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:01,019
is that when we look at this account

541
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,699
in Mark 5,

542
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:07,459
Jesus is still physically upon the earth.

543
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,899
And this man wants to go to be with Jesus.

544
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:13,139
He's getting on the ship.

545
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:14,739
And Jesus suffered him not.

546
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:15,619
He allowed him not.

547
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,099
He said, no, you need to go home to your friends

548
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,699
and you need to tell them,

549
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,219
here's your commission.

550
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:23,259
Here's what you're supposed to do.

551
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:26,579
And we find that the man immediately departs

552
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,419
and he goes and he tells.

553
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:35,339
We have the privilege of Jesus being with us.

554
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:36,339
He's left us here.

555
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,459
Notice in John 17.

556
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:39,339
We'll finish with this passage of Scripture,

557
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:41,499
but I want you to notice what Jesus is saying here

558
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,339
in John 17 as He prays just before

559
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:47,779
He would go to the cross of Calvary.

560
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,019
This really is the Lord's prayer

561
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,259
in John 17.

562
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,139
It's not the one that many refer to

563
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:57,899
as the Lord's prayer.

564
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,979
That would be a model prayer.

565
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,699
We find here in John 17

566
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:05,099
that Jesus is praying.

567
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:05,539
It says,

568
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:08,179
These words spake Jesus and lifted up His eyes to heaven

569
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,579
and said, Father, the hour has come.

570
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,139
Glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.

571
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,059
We don't have time to read the entire prayer.

572
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,059
I want you to skip down to verse 13.

573
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,219
And now come I to Thee

574
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:20,219
and these things I speak in the world

575
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:23,259
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

576
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:25,739
I have given them Thy Word.

577
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,139
The world hath hated them

578
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,579
because they are not of the world

579
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,259
even as I am not of the world.

580
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:32,979
I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world,

581
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:35,699
but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

582
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,619
They are not of the world

583
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:37,899
even as I am not of the world.

584
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,459
Sanctify them through Thy truth.

585
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:40,819
Thy Word is truth.

586
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,179
As Thou hast sent me into the world,

587
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,179
even so have I also sent them into the world.

588
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,139
And for their sakes I sanctify myself

589
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,699
and they also might be sanctified through the truth.

590
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,459
Neither pray I for these alone,

591
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,499
but for them also which shall believe on me

592
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:57,939
through their word,

593
00:34:57,939 --> 00:34:59,939
that they all may be one

594
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:02,619
as Thou, Father, art in me and I in Thee,

595
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:04,499
that they also may be one in us,

596
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:07,619
that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.

597
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,139
It tells us in verse 22,

598
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:11,579
in the glory which Thou gavest me,

599
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,419
I have given them that they may be one

600
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:14,579
even as we are one,

601
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,659
I in them and Thou in me,

602
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,739
that they may be made perfect in one,

603
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,179
that the world may know that Thou hast sent me

604
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:24,659
and hast loved them as Thou hast loved me.

605
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,699
Father, I will that they also

606
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,939
whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,

607
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:32,499
that they may behold my glory which Thou hast given me

608
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,539
for Thou lovest me before the foundation of the world.

609
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,739
Oh, righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee,

610
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:39,659
but I have known Thee

611
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,779
and these have known that Thou hast sent me

612
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:43,539
and I have declared unto them Thy name

613
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:44,819
and will declare it

614
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:47,099
that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me

615
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:51,219
may be in them and I in them.

616
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,619
And we find that here as we would understand,

617
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,779
yes, as we look at the Great Commission in Matthew,

618
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:01,219
specifically as I referenced a moment ago,

619
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:05,499
Jesus gives the commission to us as the people of God

620
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,619
to the same people that we are to go.

621
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,899
He says, all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

622
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,219
Go ye therefore, right?

623
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,219
And we understand the threefold purpose

624
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,219
or aspect of the Great Commission

625
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,139
that we're to win them to Christ,

626
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,979
baptize them and disciple them.

627
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:21,459
That's the fullness of the Great Commission,

628
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:25,699
but we go in the power of Christ.

629
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,619
But you shall receive power

630
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,299
after the Holy Ghost has come upon thee

631
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,819
in Acts chapter number one.

632
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:34,659
And we find that that instruction is given

633
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,259
to the disciples just before the ascension.

634
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:40,379
And he tells them that you're going to receive power,

635
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:42,779
that the Holy Ghost is gonna come upon you.

636
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,459
And he tells them that at that time,

637
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,579
and ye shall be witnesses unto me,

638
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,579
both in Jerusalem, Judea and on Samaria

639
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:56,059
and unto the uttermost part of the earth this evening.

640
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:59,179
Go and tell.

641
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:01,579
Go and tell.

642
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:05,939
I like what Brother Hamilton said on Wednesday evening.

643
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:09,699
I remember as I, a number of years ago,

644
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,139
preached through the book of Philippians

645
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,899
and mentioned this same portion of Scripture

646
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,419
and how that Paul said,

647
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,739
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

648
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,939
And he shares with us that difficult position that he's in

649
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,499
that he has this desire to go and to be with Christ,

650
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:27,779
which is far better.

651
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,379
I mean, listen, it's gonna be wonderful

652
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:32,699
when we get to be with Him, amen?

653
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:35,779
When we see Jesus, I mean, when we see Him face to face,

654
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:38,079
I mean, what a blessed reality

655
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,899
that as the people of God,

656
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:44,339
one day we will meet Him and we will be with Him forever.

657
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,819
But Paul said in Philippians one,

658
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:51,299
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

659
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:56,459
In verse number 24 of Philippians chapter number one.

660
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,419
And Brother Hamilton spoke about that a little bit

661
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:01,299
on Wednesday evening and what a great reminder to us

662
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:04,619
that the Lord has left us here for a purpose.

663
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,179
Just like he left that maniac from Gadara

664
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:12,379
whose life was transformed by the power of Jesus Christ.

665
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:15,259
He said, no, I'm suffering you not.

666
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,699
He didn't allow him to get on the boat.

667
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,379
He said, no, you need to stay.

668
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,979
You need to go and tell your friends.

669
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:25,239
There's some people we need to go and tell, amen?

670
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,339
There's some people we need to go and tell.

671
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:33,799
The reality is that if Jesus didn't have a purpose

672
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:36,459
for us here upon earth, at the moment of salvation,

673
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:39,579
we'd just go ahead and be transported to heaven, amen?

674
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,380
And sometimes maybe in life you say,

675
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,979
man, I wish it was that way, but it's not.

676
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,699
He's got a purpose for us here.

677
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,659
And here's something that Brother Hamilton said,

678
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,619
and I'm gonna say something different, but in like manner.

679
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:59,739
He said this, it was impactful to me as your pastor.

680
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:01,899
It was this.

681
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:05,899
This life is the only life you have to live by faith.

682
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:08,339
That's what he said.

683
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:14,779
Once we get to heaven, we see him, sight, it's not faith.

684
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:16,579
Right?

685
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:22,219
Without faith, it is impossible to please him.

686
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,219
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is

687
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:26,739
and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

688
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,260
Hebrews 11 and verse number six.

689
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Therefore, the just shall live by faith.

690
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm living by faith, but I'm only living by faith now.

691
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:40,859
Amen?

692
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,899
It's the only time we have to live by faith is right now.

693
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,779
If I could say something different, but in like manner,

694
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,179
the only time you have to go and tell somebody

695
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:54,940
the great things that Jesus has done for you is now.

696
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,260
There aren't gonna be any lost people in heaven, right?

697
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,260
If I understand the Bible properly,

698
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,800
If you understand the Bible properly,

699
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,060
the Bible teaches us

700
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,180
that only saved people will go to heaven.

701
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,260
Amen?

702
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,680
So once we take our final breath,

703
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,780
once the trumpet of the Lord sounds,

704
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,460
whichever one happens first for us,

705
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,580
there will be no more opportunity

706
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,860
for us to go and tell somebody about Christ.

707
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,400
Right? You agree with that?

708
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,020
So go home and tell thy friends.

709
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,360
That's what He tells them.

710
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,460
Go home to thy friends and tell them

711
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,280
how great things the Lord hath done for thee

712
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,820
and hath showed compassion on thee.

713
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,680
And this evening,

714
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,460
the only life I have to tell anybody about Jesus

715
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,640
is this life.

716
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Once it's over,

717
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,600
there's nobody for me to tell.

718
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,340
There's no more opportunities.

719
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,720
Oh, I will praise Him forevermore.

720
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,240
And so will you.

721
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
I mean, we'll be in His presence.

722
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,640
And what a wonderful thing that is.

723
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,800
But there's not going to be any more opportunities

724
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,400
to tell anybody about Jesus.

725
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,020
It's just this life

726
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,580
to tell anybody about Jesus.

727
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,240
And so Jesus says to this man,

728
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,860
the people,

729
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,640
they said, we want you to leave.

730
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,100
And Jesus goes to get on the ship.

731
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,440
He said, I want to go with you.

732
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,320
He said, no.

733
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,680
He suffered them not,

734
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,060
but left them.

735
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,260
Left them as a witness,

736
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,320
as a light in that place.

737
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,060
And ye are the light of the world.

738
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,460
Right, and that's what He told us.

739
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,140
Matthew, the light of the world.

740
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,400
In fact, Paul mentions it the same way in Philippians,

741
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,340
that we are lights in this world.

742
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,420
Notice what Paul says,

743
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,260
we'll close with this.

744
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,100
I wasn't going to use this verse.

745
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,440
I said Philippians chapter number,

746
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,280
is it two or three?

747
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,000
Let me look real quick.

748
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,620
Philippians chapter number two.

749
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,380
Verse number 15.

750
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,180
That you may be blameless and harmless,

751
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,020
the sons of God, without rebuke,

752
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,280
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,

753
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,900
among whom you shine as lights in the world.

754
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,340
We're in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation now.

755
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,660
Not in heaven.

756
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,540
Amen?

757
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,700
Now.

758
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,740
I have in the margin of my Bible,

759
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,720
how bright is my light?

760
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,280
Because I am to be,

761
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,760
you are to be,

762
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,000
shining lights in this world.

763
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Jesus said of John the Baptist,

764
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,040
that he was a bright and shining light.

765
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,840
I trust that would be the testimony for each of us

766
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,480
as God's people.

767
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
That we take this message,

768
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,080
go and tell.

769
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,760
Go and tell.

770
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,280
Father, we love you.

771
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,520
We thank you for loving us.

772
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,580
We thank you for this passage of Scripture in Mark 5.

773
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,380
We know that the truth is recorded

774
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,140
by Matthew and Luke as well.

775
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,940
God, we thank You for the way in which

776
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,100
this passage reveals to us

777
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,020
the conversion of this man.

778
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,660
This evening as we focus in upon

779
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,940
the commission for this man,

780
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,260
we make application in our own lives.

781
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,680
Lord, we understand that You've left us here for a purpose.

782
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,840
And that purpose is to go and tell.

783
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,800
I'm thankful that as believers

784
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,680
in what we would refer to as the church age,

785
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,800
that we go in the power

786
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,520
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

787
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,200
The power of the Holy Spirit.

788
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,980
I'm thankful You've given us the privilege

789
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,940
and opportunity to go and tell.

790
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,340
God, I believe that each person

791
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,540
that's here this evening

792
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,140
would readily testify of the great things

793
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,140
that You've done for us.

794
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,700
How You've changed our lives.

795
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,620
The miracle of salvation.

796
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,900
And how precious that is.

797
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,180
And God, I pray that we'd go

798
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,480
in the simplicity of that message

799
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,360
and share that truth with the lost and dying world.

800
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,080
That we'd simply be able to share with them,

801
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,800
can I tell you?

802
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,540
What the Lord's done for me.

803
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,600
Can I tell you how He's changed me?

804
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,559
I pray that You'd use us.

805
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,160
Give us courage and boldness.

806
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,279
Help us, Lord, to be faithful and obedient

807
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:45,400
even as this man,

808
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,860
who upon receiving the commission,

809
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,619
embraced it,

810
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:55,260
departed and published.

811
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,339
All men did marvel.

812
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,100
Help us, Lord.

813
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,180
I pray that You'd have Your will and way

814
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,220
in the time of invitation

815
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,180
that decisions would be made

816
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,020
that would please Thee

817
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,860
and we'll thank You for it.

818
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,339
In Christ's name we pray.

819
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:06,180
Would you stand with me?

820
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,180
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

821
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,580
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

822
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,580
As she does, the altar...
