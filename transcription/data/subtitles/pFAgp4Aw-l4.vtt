00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
Here in Mark chapter number five as we look at this passage of scripture this evening

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.479
I want to deal with the subject matter really the passage that we're looking at will record for us the

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.280
great miracle that took place the maniac Gadara and

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:22.399
This man's conversion and what-have-you and as we look at this passage of scripture

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.280
I want to read verse 19 to you and give you the

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.319
Titling kind of get into the message this evening in Mark 5 in verse number 19

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.439
The Bible says how be it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:42.040
Go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and hath

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.479
had compassion on

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.860
Thee I'm gonna preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled go and tell

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.259
Go and tell now as I was preparing the message and thinking about that title

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:03.860
I was reminded of days in grade school when we had show and tell let me remember show and tell

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.819
Yeah, somebody remember that right and you'd have show and tell and it wasn't very often. I don't remember

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.660
Having show and tell on a regular basis

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.099
in fact

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.620
I

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.620
tried to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
in my mind remember some of the things that some of my

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:22.180
Classmates brought some of the things that I took for show-and-tell and I was coming up with a blank

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.739
And so it seems as if nothing was too, you know that life

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.139
impactful at a show-and-tell

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.900
In my elementary days in grade school

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.379
however

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:38.059
I know that what would happen is we'd go to school and really was kind of an exciting day and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.980
You would go and you would prepare for what is it that I'm gonna take and you'd bring something in and you would show

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:50.459
Your classmates whatever that object was and then you would tell them about it and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.860
No doubt there were times in which you'd try to find something that was unique

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.660
right something that not everybody else in the class would have and be familiar with and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.779
want to take them something that was unique that you could show them and maybe be proud of and what have you and

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:11.059
you'd have the show-and-tell and you'd hear all of the students and what have you as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.580
We think about the times in in grade school of show-and-tell and we think about those funny memories

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.559
I'm thinking this evening about the passage that is before us and the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.339
Instruction that the Lord Jesus Christ gives to this man. He doesn't tell him to show and tell

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.899
In fact in Luke, he tells him to go and show them great things that the Lord has done

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.419
But here as it's recorded in Mark, he says go and tell

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:45.199
As I think about that message that Jesus gives to this man at Gadara

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.139
this maniac that had experienced the power of God a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.899
mindful this evening of the

00:02:53.899 --> 00:03:00.259
Responsibility that has been given to each of us as the people of God the children of God to go and tell

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.539
to go and tell

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.059
The reality this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture were reminded of the power of God

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.460
I'm so thankful that the our God is omnipotent that he has all power

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.039
I'm thankful that he did not simply declare to us that he has all power though

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:23.779
He did we find that he's demonstrated on a number of occasions throughout his word his great power

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.660
In fact as you read through the gospel accounts and you read the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.899
You find how that he's demonstrating his power over various things. He demonstrates his power over nature

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.619
He demonstrates his power over disease. He demonstrates his power

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.820
Such as this passage of Scripture over the demons and I'm so thankful that our God has all power

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.500
And he demonstrated that power we think about the miracles of Christ

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.139
And of course we can think about the miracles of the Bible in its entirety and you can see the power of God demonstrated

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.820
But you think about the impact that those miracles had not only on the ones that were the recipients

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.779
Personally of the the power of God, but those that saw those that were eyewitnesses of what God did

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.419
the power of God

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:15.100
We find in this passage of Scripture. The Bible begins in verse number one and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.660
it says and they

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.540
Came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the Gadarenes now

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.600
It's interesting because Jesus is with his disciples

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.119
And if you read the latter part of chapter number four, you find one of those

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.920
Instances in which the Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated his power over nature

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.920
It was there when they were in the midst of a storm and Jesus was asleep on a pillow and they came to him saying master

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.559
Carest thou not that we perish and we find that it was Jesus in this particular account that he stands and he says peace

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:56.600
Be still the Bible tells us that the wind ceased and there was a great calm

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.760
He then says to them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith they

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.839
Were fearing exceedingly they said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea?

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.519
obey him

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.559
this was a a

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.480
Week in which they had experienced many amazing things much teaching and

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.480
many miracles

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480
We find that we come to

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.160
chapter number five and we know that the chapter divisions are there for us and the Bible says that they came over under the other

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.700
side of the sea

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.679
They were instructed to pass over to the other side in verse number 35 of chapter number four

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.440
It says the same day when the even was come he says unto them

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.959
Let us pass over under the other side. There was a purpose for them crossing the sea

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:52.540
There was a purpose for them going to the the country of the Gatorades and that purpose was to meet this man that the

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.359
passage of Scripture deals with in its entirety and we find that this

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:03.519
Encounter is recorded for us and really in the first 18 verses of the chapter

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:06.040
We find if you were to take notes this evening

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.880
The man was converted and it's a lengthy passage that shares with us all of the interaction and all that takes place

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.160
The Bible tells us that when they got they arrived there to the country of the Gatorades

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.799
It says in verse number two and when he was come out of the ship

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:22.600
Immediately there met him out of the tombs a man

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.799
with an unclean spirit

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.519
And the Bible tells us of this interaction that this man with this unclean spirit

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:37.160
We often would refer to him as the maniac of Gadara that this man

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.920
Immediately upon the Lord Jesus Christ God in flesh

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.720
coming off of that ship this man meets him and the Bible tells us in verse 3 and

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
Following some things about this man some of his characteristics and some of his

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:56.920
Behavior it says who had his dwelling among the tombs

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:01.359
And no man could bind him. No not with chains

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:10.040
Because they had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:11.640
pieces neither

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.640
Could any man?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.760
tame him

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:18.119
And always

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:21.920
Night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.799
crying and cutting himself

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.720
with stones

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:33.399
The picture that is painted of this man's behavior some of his characteristics in verses 3 through 5

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.880
Really would lead us to a place where you say I wouldn't like to meet that fella

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.880
Amen

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.359
Not someone that I would like to meet

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:47.480
Not someone I care to have interaction with we find the Bible says in verse number 6

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.000
But when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.839
And cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus now son of the Most High God I

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:03.600
Adjure thee by God that thou torment me not

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.399
It's interesting. We've often said as you read through the gospel accounts the truth that the demons they understand who Jesus is

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.399
They know that he is God. They know

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:20.399
Who he is. In fact, you find that here they say to torment me not they

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:26.519
Understand the the plan of God they understand listen the devil knows that his time is short

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:33.200
the devil knows that he's gonna be cast in the lake of fire and he's gonna be tormented day and night forever and ever and

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.119
these

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:43.359
Demons here that had indwelled this particular man that possessed this man. They understand who Jesus is

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.000
The Bible tells us and James that the devils believe and

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.080
Tremble they know who Jesus is

00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:01.119
Verse number 8 it says for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he Jesus asked him

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:02.640
What is?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.640
thy name and

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:07.320
He answered saying my name is legion

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:10.239
for we are many

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.280
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.239
There was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils besought him saying send us

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.840
into the swine that we may enter into them and

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.880
forthwith Jesus gave them leave

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.119
The unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.679
there were about

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.679
2,000 and were choked in the sea and

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.440
They that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.799
That was done. Now. I want you to consider put yourself in the place here in Gadara

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:52.320
If you will and understand what is happening as we find that Jesus and his disciples have crossed over

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.479
The sea as it's recorded for us at the end of chapter before and they arrived

00:09:57.159 --> 00:10:00.239
into the country of the Gadarenes and we find

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:02.979
that as they begin to get off of the ship,

00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:04.679
that this man that no doubt

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.099
they knew about this man

00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:07.439
that had an unclean spirit.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.499
The Bible tells us

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:10.339
that neither could any man tame him.

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:12.679
The Bible tells us that he was often

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.899
bound with fetters and chains.

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:16.939
And we understand that this man,

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:22.699
the people of Gadar had some knowledge of this man.

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.379
And they see what's happening

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:25.579
and the Bible tells us

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:27.979
that as the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:31.179
is having interaction with this demon-possessed man,

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:34.559
he's speaking to the demon specifically.

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:36.079
And he says, what is thy name?

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.619
And the answer comes

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.719
and you find that they make a request.

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:40.919
They beseech the Lord

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:43.719
that they would not send them out away into the country.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:50.239
They had this desire to enter into the swine.

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:53.399
And Jesus gave them leave in v. 13.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:55.399
And what that reveals to us is again

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.719
that Jesus has all power.

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:02.699
Again, the demons did not have the choice

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:04.699
as to what they did or where they went

00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:05.859
and how they went.

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:08.139
We find that Jesus gave them leave.

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:10.139
Jesus allowed this to happen.

00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:11.639
He permitted it to happen.

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:12.879
Of course, we'd understand

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.379
with the Jewish culture

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:18.259
and the dietary restrictions

00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:19.479
and all of those things,

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.939
though this particular region

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:24.939
would have been more Gentile than Jewish,

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:26.439
we find that no doubt

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:29.699
there were some things that were taking place

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:32.019
with the raising of these swine and what have you,

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:34.479
and Jesus would allow them, these demons,

00:11:34.479 --> 00:11:38.399
to have the opportunity to go into these swine.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.819
The Bible tells us that they entered into the swine

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:42.499
and notice what happens.

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:47.019
The herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:49.279
But the Bible tells us something interesting

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.579
in v. 14, it says,

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:56.079
and they that fed the swine fled.

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.639
They were holding it in the city, in the country,

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:02.659
and they went out to see what it was that was done.

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:05.779
There's some people that observe what took place.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:09.499
They saw these swine that were over there

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:12.179
and I'm not sure how they were behaving

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:15.519
prior to these demons entering into them,

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.939
but as soon as these demons were cast out of this man

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.379
and entered into those swine,

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:23.339
the Bible tells us that they ran violently

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:25.679
down a steep,

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:28.039
and we find that they were choked in the sea.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:33.439
They died. They ran violently.

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:37.079
They saw it and they went and they told some people.

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:39.779
They let them know what had happened.

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.199
And it's interesting that it says

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:44.459
they went out to see what was that was done.

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:46.919
Whoever it is that these that fed the swine,

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:50.399
whoever they told in the city and in the country,

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:53.799
there was a group of people that came back.

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:55.639
I want you to think about it in your mind's eye.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.179
Put yourself there again

00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:58.599
and understand what's happening

00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.419
as the report had been given.

00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:03.499
It's mindful as you look at various portions of Scripture

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.459
and you see how there are times

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:07.299
in which people would go

00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:10.859
and share truth with others to bring them.

00:13:10.859 --> 00:13:14.059
I think about the situation in John 4

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.259
when Jesus said, I must go through.

00:13:16.259 --> 00:13:18.259
I must pass through Samaria.

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:21.319
And He meets the woman of the well.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:23.399
And you remember that after that interaction,

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.199
she goes back and says,

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:29.079
come, see a man that told me all things ever I've done.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:31.319
And there's a great host of people

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:34.039
that come back to where Jesus is

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.679
in John 4.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.879
The Bible tells us in that passage of Scripture

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:40.239
that there were some that believed

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:42.339
because of the testimony of the woman.

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:44.319
But the Bible tells us that there were

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:45.879
a great number of people,

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.859
many more that believed

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:49.679
because of His own Word.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.599
He spent two days teaching those people

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.259
that came back in John 4.

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:55.999
And here in Mark 5,

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:59.439
we're not told of the size of the crowd that returns,

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:01.799
but we find that as they would return

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.639
to the place in which these

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:07.119
that had fed the swine told them of,

00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:08.579
that they came,

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.979
and notice what it tells us in v. 15,

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.279
and they come to Jesus,

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:14.839
and notice what it says,

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:18.619
and see Him that was possessed

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:22.779
with the devil and had the legion.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.979
What does it tell us?

00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:27.819
They see this man sitting

00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:30.019
and clothed

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:32.440
and in his right mind.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.339
And they were afraid.

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:37.259
There's a great change

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:40.059
in the life of this individual.

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.739
We find there's a great contrast

00:14:41.739 --> 00:14:44.739
in v. 15 to what we read in v. 3-5

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:47.279
with regard to the characteristics of this man

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.359
and his behavior.

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:51.119
And we find now that this man

00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:53.679
who had been in this situation

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.599
where he was dwelling among the tombs,

00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:58.039
where he was not able to be bound,

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:01.759
this man now is sitting at the feet of Jesus.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:05.639
He's clothed in his right mind.

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:09.419
No doubt, the people are perplexed.

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:11.759
No doubt, they've heard from these

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:14.399
that fed the swine what had taken place,

00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:17.720
and they come and they see this scene.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.419
And the Bible says that they were sore afraid.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.799
They were sore afraid.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.440
It says, "...and they that saw it told them

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.479
how it befell to him that was possessed

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:32.000
with the devil and also concerning the swine."

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.919
It's interesting as we begin to see

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:36.119
what's happening here in Mark 5

00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:38.000
in the account that is given to us,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.319
and we begin to see how these people

00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:44.160
are just receiving this information,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.880
but it's sad how they respond

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.559
to the information that they receive.

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.239
This man that had no doubt

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:53.479
had some level of being a nuisance

00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:55.720
and they tried to bind him

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.199
and all of these things,

00:15:57.199 --> 00:15:59.519
and now the man is sitting in cloth

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.799
in his right mind.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.679
And Luke would tell us that he's sitting

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:03.919
at the feet of Jesus.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.720
No doubt, he's being instructed

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.559
and he's receiving the truth

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:08.919
of the Word of God.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.959
And we find here that the people

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.239
receive this message,

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.199
but they respond in this manner

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:16.359
in verse 17.

00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:18.399
"...they began to pray him

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:23.880
to depart out of their coast."

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.639
Really what the Scriptures are telling us

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:28.799
is they wanted Jesus to leave.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:31.599
They wanted Jesus to leave.

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:36.839
That He would depart out of their coast.

00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:38.160
And then the Bible tells us this,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.880
"...and when He was come into the ship,

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.319
that He is Jesus."

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:46.880
It then tells us that He that had been

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.639
possessed with the devil,

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:54.759
prayed Him that He might be with Him.

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.359
Now, as a side note,

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.399
as we would consider even as we looked

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.399
in the book of Hebrews not long ago,

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:02.199
and we dealt with some of those things

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:04.639
that should accompany salvation.

00:17:04.639 --> 00:17:06.720
We speak about some birthmarks of the believer.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.919
The reality is that as we are believers,

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:13.359
as our souls, we get saved

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.559
and we're born again

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.239
and we have that transformation,

00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:20.959
we ought to desire to be with Him.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:23.119
And we find here that this man,

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.440
as Jesus is going to depart,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.519
He's come to Gadara for just a short period of time.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:30.160
He came there for a purpose

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.759
and we find that the people of the city,

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:36.239
they begin to pray Him to depart out of their coast

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:38.479
and Jesus is getting onto the ship

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:40.160
and as He's planning to leave,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.359
this one that was possessed of the devil

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:45.639
prayed Him that He might be with Him.

00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:48.759
Now, I don't blame the guy for wanting to go with Jesus.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.519
Do you?

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.440
If they wanted Jesus to leave

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.679
and this man had experienced the power of Christ

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.199
and he had experienced this transformation,

00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:01.319
he wants to be with Jesus.

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:04.839
I think it's commendable.

00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:08.319
But Jesus tells them no.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.119
Jesus tells them no.

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:13.799
It's not because Jesus didn't want Him to be with them.

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:19.039
It's because Jesus was leaving a witness behind.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:21.880
We find that the Bible says in v. 19,

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.839
how be it Jesus suffered Him not.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:30.160
He didn't allow Him to come.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.399
And then He gives them some instruction.

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:34.200
We see that the man was converted.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:38.559
We now see that the man is commissioned.

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:44.080
I love the direct nature of what Jesus says to this man.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.640
Again, Jesus has been there

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.839
and He's given some instruction.

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:49.559
The man wants to go to be with them.

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:51.640
And Jesus allows him not,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.599
but gives him a commission.

00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:56.080
He says this,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.119
go home to thy friends

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:02.919
and tell them how great things

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:06.520
the Lord hath done for thee

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.320
and hath had compassion on thee.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.119
Go and tell.

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:17.239
He told them where to go.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.479
And He told them what to tell them.

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:20.679
Amen?

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:22.559
He had experienced something.

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.640
By the way, I mentioned this morning

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.679
as we referenced a portion of Scripture in Acts 16

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.080
that the message of that girl

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:33.440
that was possessed with a spirit of divination

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.440
that she was giving the right message,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.119
but it was the wrong vessel.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:40.479
Now we have a man that has been transformed.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.679
He's been born again.

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:43.239
He's been converted.

00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:45.880
And now, he is given the responsibility

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.839
to go and tell.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:50.000
Go home to thy friends.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.760
There was a responsibility

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.039
that was laid upon this individual.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:56.080
This man that we often refer to

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.239
as the maniac of Gadara,

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.320
he was given this great responsibility.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:07.320
and he was given this commission to go home to his friends and he's told to

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.560
tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee I wonder this morning this

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.480
evening it's not morning anymore I wonder this evening has God done great

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:28.880
things for you I've been so good to us the truth of redemption the the miracle

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.960
of redemption the fact that I was lost and on my way to a Christless eternity

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.520
the book of Ephesians the Apostle Paul he deals with it this way that we have

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:52.240
no hope right we're strangers we have no hope but yet receive that message of the

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.640
gospel of Jesus Christ and we find that he's done great things for us the

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:05.480
truth of conversion it says and have had compassion on thee we often speak of the

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.560
fact that our Lord is compassionate I'm thankful that Jeremiah said his

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.960
compassions they fail not I'm thankful that often as you read the gospel

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.440
accounts you find that the Lord Jesus Christ is moved with compassion in fact

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.140
in the passage of Scripture in Matthew chapter 9 a passage a passage that we

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.380
often reference about the harvest being plenteous and the labors being few the

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.780
Bible tells us in verse number 36 of that portion of Scripture that when he

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:43.580
Jesus saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them why because they

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.860
fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.400
unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labors are few pray

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.520
therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.960
harvest and here in our passage in Mark chapter number five this man has a

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.800
desire to depart to be with the Lord and Jesus suffered him not he allowed him

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.920
not but he gave him some very important direction the responsibility that is

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.760
laid upon this man is responsibility that he gladly accepted we see that

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:27.080
through his actions as is recorded in verse number 20 the Bible says and he

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:34.760
departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:44.240
done for him and then the Bible says this and all men did marvel as we look

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.920
at the account that is before us this evening and we consider the the

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.560
commission that was given to this individual and we understand that Jesus

00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:00.160
gave him specific instruction as to where to go and what to tell and how to

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.400
communicate these things to those that he would come into contact with it the

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:12.200
man immediately he received the instruction and he obeyed he departed

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:18.800
and began to publish I like the way that the Bible records for us how the man

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.560
just simply submitted to the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ okay this is

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:31.080
what you're leaving me to do I'll do it and the Bible says that he did exactly

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:38.520
as he was told he departed Jesus said go and he began to publish Jesus said tell

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:46.320
and he published in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him see this

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.640
evening God's done some great things for us I've often found not so much in

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.680
recent weeks or months but in time before Kovat is there was more

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.600
interaction and more opportunity to go out and speak with individuals and even

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.600
during this time of Kovat there have been unique opportunities just not as

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:16.360
many we find that it's my approach has changed slightly and the fact that as I

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.760
begin to speak with individuals I asked him if I can share with them what Jesus

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.279
did has done for me can I tell you what he's done for me can I tell you how he

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:30.040
changed my life can I tell you how and all of a sudden it's it's a different

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.240
response Joseph you've been door-knocking with me for years Joseph

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.720
been my partner and there's other folks that I've gone door-knocking with but

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.720
I've taken Joseph door-knocking many many many times and Holly will go with

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.720
the girls and they're always asked hey are you guys sisters and Joseph used to

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.360
say daddy why doesn't anyone ever think we're brothers I'll leave it alone amen

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.880
he's getting older now so I don't know I mean if he shaves his hair a little

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.559
shorter maybe somebody will I don't know in any case there have been times that

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:11.520
he's no doubt experienced as he's heard the interactions or the people that hey

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.119
my name is so-and-so you know go hey I don't ever introduce myself as pastor I

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:19.480
am Chris this is Joseph for Fellowship Baptist Church I'd like to invite you to

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:27.520
church you know any people accept that that's okay we're good honestly right how

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.839
many people we say that to all the time there was one day I can't remember the

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:38.360
exact day I probably have it in a note down in my office but I took a different

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.880
approach I said hi my name is Chris my son Joseph can I tell you how God

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.200
changed my life I like to share with you what Jesus has done for me you know that

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.320
on that day I had opportunity to speak more deeply with more people in one day

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:03.160
than I had in weeks combined of door-knocking here's a thought when I

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.960
invite somebody to church they already kind of have an idea of what church is

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.440
like they've already had in their mind perhaps an experience with church maybe

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.520
a bad experience I'm not going to church church is boring churches whatever they

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.720
think right whatever their experience has been whatever's led to their

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.760
conclusion with regard to church so immediately as I say I'd like to invite

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.520
you to church there's a certain something that takes place in them when

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.240
they hear those words but if I say to them can I tell you how God's changed my

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.600
life can I tell you how he's given me hope can I tell you how he's given me a

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.839
peace can I tell you all of a sudden there's man people don't have that stuff

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.720
people are looking for that and all of a sudden you have an opportunity to be

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:04.679
able to start sharing the great things that he God has done for me and the

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:11.480
Bible says all men did marvel I wonder in the last I don't know generation or

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:18.880
two in our churches where we have had so much impact sorry instruction wrong word

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:26.679
so much instruction on how to go so winning quote-unquote and we memorize

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:31.080
our little script as to what we're going to say and we go through our little

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:39.520
verses and I'm not I'm not seeking to be unkind but typically in that memorized

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:48.000
kind of sales pitch ish kind of a thing how many people have been turned off

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:57.399
Jesus told this man to go and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for

00:27:57.399 --> 00:28:05.440
thee so I wonder this evening if we take the approach of not so much just trying

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.320
to go through some memorized script of how I'm supposed to invite somebody to

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.800
come and to visit our church and this that and the other thing is if I begin

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.880
to approach it in the manner of can I tell you what he's done for me can I

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:27.960
tell you how he changed my life because here's the amazing thing you have the

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:35.559
testimony of a transformed life this you don't have this guy's testimony amen you

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:39.400
know it's his testimony you don't have my testimony and I don't have your

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.720
testimony but you have a testimony I know it's amazing is that you can

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:51.000
speak passionately about what Christ has done for you why cuz it's real amen

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.080
and you're not talking about what he's done for somebody else though we can

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.400
maybe use some examples but you're talking about what he's done for you and

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.280
when you talk about what he's done for you and they see that it's genuine they

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.320
see that it's real have you ever dealt with some salespeople that you're just

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.559
like man this guy is just he is a sales guy right I don't want to be that guy

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:19.239
knocking on somebody's door I'm not trying to sell somebody the gospel it's

00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:25.720
not for sale you can't buy it amen and so I don't want someone to get the

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:33.359
impression that I'm just going through some little you know sales pitch but let

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:37.559
me tell you what he's done for me let me tell you changes my life so I don't know

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:43.720
if you can remember when you were lost I can remember when I was lost I can

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.919
remember when I didn't have the peace that I have today I can remember when I

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:52.479
didn't have the purpose that I have today I can remember and I know that you

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:57.520
can remember as well most many of you and when you can remember those things

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.479
begin to share that and you say let me tell you what he's

00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:05.239
is done for me,

00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:08.019
and the impact that that can make on others.

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:10.939
All men did marvel.

00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:12.199
I want to share with you,

00:30:12.199 --> 00:30:22.599
go over to Luke 1 if you will.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:24.279
It's a slightly different context

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:26.319
as to what is taking place here.

00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:29.879
But I want you to read and hear the words,

00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:33.019
the testimony that is given here.

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:34.679
We begin looking in verse 41.

00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:36.219
It came to pass that when Elizabeth

00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:37.659
heard the salutation of Mary,

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:39.059
the babe leaped in her womb,

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:41.339
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.979
And she spake out with a loud voice and said,

00:30:43.979 --> 00:30:45.499
Blessed art thou among women,

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:47.939
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:49.139
And whence is this to me,

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:51.099
that the mother of my Lord

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:52.859
should come to me?

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:55.579
For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation

00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:56.819
sounded in mine ears,

00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:00.299
the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:01.739
And blessed is she that believed,

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:04.099
and there shall be a performance of those things

00:31:04.099 --> 00:31:07.099
which were told her from the Lord.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:10.099
And look at what Mary says.

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:11.859
Verse 46,

00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:15.619
My soul doth magnify the Lord,

00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:19.499
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.

00:31:19.499 --> 00:31:21.739
For He hath regarded the low state of His handmaiden,

00:31:21.739 --> 00:31:23.699
for behold, from henceforth all generations

00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:24.819
shall call me blessed.

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:27.459
For He that is mighty

00:31:27.459 --> 00:31:30.139
hath done to me great things,

00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:35.099
and holy is His name.

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:37.739
I understand contextually what Mary is speaking of

00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:40.099
is different than what we're dealing with this evening,

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:43.379
but I'd like to adopt the words of verse 49

00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:45.099
and apply them to our lives

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:47.219
as far as conversion is concerned.

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:50.219
And I'd like to say that He that is mighty

00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:53.499
hath done to me great things,

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:57.179
and holy is His name.

00:31:57.179 --> 00:31:59.019
And I have the opportunity, the privilege

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:01.179
of being His representative.

00:32:01.179 --> 00:32:02.339
And the thing that's amazing

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:04.579
is that in this particular account,

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:07.659
in Mark 5 that we're studying this evening,

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:11.179
the reality is that Jesus had not yet gone

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.579
to the cross of Calvary.

00:32:12.579 --> 00:32:16.139
Jesus had not yet been in the tomb for those three days.

00:32:16.139 --> 00:32:17.699
He'd not yet ascended,

00:32:17.699 --> 00:32:20.179
raised from the dead and then ascended to heaven.

00:32:20.179 --> 00:32:24.899
But we find that now as those events

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.699
are historically past,

00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:30.219
that Jesus has paid for the sin of mankind

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:32.739
by going to the cross of Calvary.

00:32:32.739 --> 00:32:33.659
He's been buried.

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:34.979
He's risen from the dead.

00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:36.979
He's conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:32:36.979 --> 00:32:38.579
He's ascended into heaven.

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.339
And He's done something miraculous

00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:41.819
in the fact that He's given us

00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:44.939
the Holy Spirit of God.

00:32:44.939 --> 00:32:48.139
And in so doing, He says this

00:32:48.139 --> 00:32:49.659
when He gives the Great Commission

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:51.459
in Matthew 28,

00:32:51.499 --> 00:32:56.179
in lo, I am with you always.

00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:58.739
And so here's the amazing thing

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:01.019
is that when we look at this account

00:33:01.019 --> 00:33:02.699
in Mark 5,

00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:07.459
Jesus is still physically upon the earth.

00:33:07.459 --> 00:33:10.899
And this man wants to go to be with Jesus.

00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:13.139
He's getting on the ship.

00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:14.739
And Jesus suffered him not.

00:33:14.739 --> 00:33:15.619
He allowed him not.

00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:18.099
He said, no, you need to go home to your friends

00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:19.699
and you need to tell them,

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:21.219
here's your commission.

00:33:21.219 --> 00:33:23.259
Here's what you're supposed to do.

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:26.579
And we find that the man immediately departs

00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:30.419
and he goes and he tells.

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:35.339
We have the privilege of Jesus being with us.

00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:36.339
He's left us here.

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:37.459
Notice in John 17.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:39.339
We'll finish with this passage of Scripture,

00:33:39.339 --> 00:33:41.499
but I want you to notice what Jesus is saying here

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:44.339
in John 17 as He prays just before

00:33:44.339 --> 00:33:47.779
He would go to the cross of Calvary.

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:51.019
This really is the Lord's prayer

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:54.259
in John 17.

00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:56.139
It's not the one that many refer to

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:57.899
as the Lord's prayer.

00:33:57.899 --> 00:34:00.979
That would be a model prayer.

00:34:00.979 --> 00:34:02.699
We find here in John 17

00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:05.099
that Jesus is praying.

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:05.539
It says,

00:34:05.539 --> 00:34:08.179
These words spake Jesus and lifted up His eyes to heaven

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.579
and said, Father, the hour has come.

00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:13.139
Glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.059
We don't have time to read the entire prayer.

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:17.059
I want you to skip down to verse 13.

00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:18.219
And now come I to Thee

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.219
and these things I speak in the world

00:34:20.259 --> 00:34:23.259
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

00:34:23.259 --> 00:34:25.739
I have given them Thy Word.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.139
The world hath hated them

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.579
because they are not of the world

00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:30.259
even as I am not of the world.

00:34:30.259 --> 00:34:32.979
I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world,

00:34:32.979 --> 00:34:35.699
but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:36.619
They are not of the world

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:37.899
even as I am not of the world.

00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:39.459
Sanctify them through Thy truth.

00:34:39.459 --> 00:34:40.819
Thy Word is truth.

00:34:40.819 --> 00:34:43.179
As Thou hast sent me into the world,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:47.179
even so have I also sent them into the world.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.139
And for their sakes I sanctify myself

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.699
and they also might be sanctified through the truth.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.459
Neither pray I for these alone,

00:34:53.459 --> 00:34:56.499
but for them also which shall believe on me

00:34:56.499 --> 00:34:57.939
through their word,

00:34:57.939 --> 00:34:59.939
that they all may be one

00:34:59.939 --> 00:35:02.619
as Thou, Father, art in me and I in Thee,

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:04.499
that they also may be one in us,

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:07.619
that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:10.139
It tells us in verse 22,

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:11.579
in the glory which Thou gavest me,

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:13.419
I have given them that they may be one

00:35:13.419 --> 00:35:14.579
even as we are one,

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:17.659
I in them and Thou in me,

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.739
that they may be made perfect in one,

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:22.179
that the world may know that Thou hast sent me

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:24.659
and hast loved them as Thou hast loved me.

00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:26.699
Father, I will that they also

00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:29.939
whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,

00:35:29.939 --> 00:35:32.499
that they may behold my glory which Thou hast given me

00:35:32.499 --> 00:35:35.539
for Thou lovest me before the foundation of the world.

00:35:35.539 --> 00:35:38.739
Oh, righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee,

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:39.659
but I have known Thee

00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.779
and these have known that Thou hast sent me

00:35:41.779 --> 00:35:43.539
and I have declared unto them Thy name

00:35:43.539 --> 00:35:44.819
and will declare it

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:47.099
that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me

00:35:47.539 --> 00:35:51.219
may be in them and I in them.

00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:55.619
And we find that here as we would understand,

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:58.779
yes, as we look at the Great Commission in Matthew,

00:35:58.779 --> 00:36:01.219
specifically as I referenced a moment ago,

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:05.499
Jesus gives the commission to us as the people of God

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:07.619
to the same people that we are to go.

00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:09.899
He says, all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:11.219
Go ye therefore, right?

00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:13.219
And we understand the threefold purpose

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:15.219
or aspect of the Great Commission

00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:17.139
that we're to win them to Christ,

00:36:17.139 --> 00:36:18.979
baptize them and disciple them.

00:36:18.979 --> 00:36:21.459
That's the fullness of the Great Commission,

00:36:21.459 --> 00:36:25.699
but we go in the power of Christ.

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:27.619
But you shall receive power

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:30.299
after the Holy Ghost has come upon thee

00:36:30.299 --> 00:36:31.819
in Acts chapter number one.

00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:34.659
And we find that that instruction is given

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.259
to the disciples just before the ascension.

00:36:37.259 --> 00:36:40.379
And he tells them that you're going to receive power,

00:36:40.379 --> 00:36:42.779
that the Holy Ghost is gonna come upon you.

00:36:42.779 --> 00:36:45.459
And he tells them that at that time,

00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:48.579
and ye shall be witnesses unto me,

00:36:48.579 --> 00:36:51.579
both in Jerusalem, Judea and on Samaria

00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:56.059
and unto the uttermost part of the earth this evening.

00:36:57.179 --> 00:36:59.179
Go and tell.

00:37:00.379 --> 00:37:01.579
Go and tell.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:05.939
I like what Brother Hamilton said on Wednesday evening.

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:09.699
I remember as I, a number of years ago,

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:11.139
preached through the book of Philippians

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:14.899
and mentioned this same portion of Scripture

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.419
and how that Paul said,

00:37:17.419 --> 00:37:19.739
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:23.939
And he shares with us that difficult position that he's in

00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:26.499
that he has this desire to go and to be with Christ,

00:37:26.499 --> 00:37:27.779
which is far better.

00:37:28.659 --> 00:37:30.379
I mean, listen, it's gonna be wonderful

00:37:30.379 --> 00:37:32.699
when we get to be with Him, amen?

00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:35.779
When we see Jesus, I mean, when we see Him face to face,

00:37:35.779 --> 00:37:38.079
I mean, what a blessed reality

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.899
that as the people of God,

00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:44.339
one day we will meet Him and we will be with Him forever.

00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:47.819
But Paul said in Philippians one,

00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:51.299
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:56.459
In verse number 24 of Philippians chapter number one.

00:37:56.459 --> 00:37:58.419
And Brother Hamilton spoke about that a little bit

00:37:58.419 --> 00:38:01.299
on Wednesday evening and what a great reminder to us

00:38:01.299 --> 00:38:04.619
that the Lord has left us here for a purpose.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:08.179
Just like he left that maniac from Gadara

00:38:08.179 --> 00:38:12.379
whose life was transformed by the power of Jesus Christ.

00:38:12.379 --> 00:38:15.259
He said, no, I'm suffering you not.

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.699
He didn't allow him to get on the boat.

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:18.379
He said, no, you need to stay.

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:20.979
You need to go and tell your friends.

00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:25.239
There's some people we need to go and tell, amen?

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:27.339
There's some people we need to go and tell.

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:33.799
The reality is that if Jesus didn't have a purpose

00:38:33.799 --> 00:38:36.459
for us here upon earth, at the moment of salvation,

00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:39.579
we'd just go ahead and be transported to heaven, amen?

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:42.380
And sometimes maybe in life you say,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.979
man, I wish it was that way, but it's not.

00:38:46.859 --> 00:38:48.699
He's got a purpose for us here.

00:38:48.699 --> 00:38:50.659
And here's something that Brother Hamilton said,

00:38:50.659 --> 00:38:53.619
and I'm gonna say something different, but in like manner.

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:59.739
He said this, it was impactful to me as your pastor.

00:39:00.419 --> 00:39:01.899
It was this.

00:39:01.899 --> 00:39:05.899
This life is the only life you have to live by faith.

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.339
That's what he said.

00:39:09.779 --> 00:39:14.779
Once we get to heaven, we see him, sight, it's not faith.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:16.579
Right?

00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:22.219
Without faith, it is impossible to please him.

00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:24.219
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is

00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:26.739
and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:29.260
Hebrews 11 and verse number six.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.260
Therefore, the just shall live by faith.

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:38.820
I'm living by faith, but I'm only living by faith now.

00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:40.859
Amen?

00:39:40.859 --> 00:39:43.899
It's the only time we have to live by faith is right now.

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:48.779
If I could say something different, but in like manner,

00:39:48.779 --> 00:39:51.179
the only time you have to go and tell somebody

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:54.940
the great things that Jesus has done for you is now.

00:39:56.179 --> 00:40:00.260
There aren't gonna be any lost people in heaven, right?

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.260
If I understand the Bible properly,

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.800
If you understand the Bible properly,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.060
the Bible teaches us

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.180
that only saved people will go to heaven.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.260
Amen?

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.680
So once we take our final breath,

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.780
once the trumpet of the Lord sounds,

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.460
whichever one happens first for us,

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.580
there will be no more opportunity

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.860
for us to go and tell somebody about Christ.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.400
Right? You agree with that?

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.020
So go home and tell thy friends.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.360
That's what He tells them.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.460
Go home to thy friends and tell them

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.280
how great things the Lord hath done for thee

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.820
and hath showed compassion on thee.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.680
And this evening,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.460
the only life I have to tell anybody about Jesus

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.640
is this life.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.480
Once it's over,

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.600
there's nobody for me to tell.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.340
There's no more opportunities.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.720
Oh, I will praise Him forevermore.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.240
And so will you.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.260
I mean, we'll be in His presence.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.640
And what a wonderful thing that is.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.800
But there's not going to be any more opportunities

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.400
to tell anybody about Jesus.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.020
It's just this life

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.580
to tell anybody about Jesus.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.240
And so Jesus says to this man,

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.860
the people,

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.640
they said, we want you to leave.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.100
And Jesus goes to get on the ship.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.440
He said, I want to go with you.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.320
He said, no.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.680
He suffered them not,

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.060
but left them.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.260
Left them as a witness,

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.320
as a light in that place.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.060
And ye are the light of the world.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.460
Right, and that's what He told us.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.140
Matthew, the light of the world.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.400
In fact, Paul mentions it the same way in Philippians,

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.340
that we are lights in this world.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.420
Notice what Paul says,

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.260
we'll close with this.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.100
I wasn't going to use this verse.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.440
I said Philippians chapter number,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.280
is it two or three?

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.000
Let me look real quick.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.620
Philippians chapter number two.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.380
Verse number 15.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.180
That you may be blameless and harmless,

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.020
the sons of God, without rebuke,

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.280
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.900
among whom you shine as lights in the world.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.340
We're in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation now.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.660
Not in heaven.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.540
Amen?

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.700
Now.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.740
I have in the margin of my Bible,

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.720
how bright is my light?

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.280
Because I am to be,

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.760
you are to be,

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.000
shining lights in this world.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.840
Jesus said of John the Baptist,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.040
that he was a bright and shining light.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.840
I trust that would be the testimony for each of us

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.480
as God's people.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480
That we take this message,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.080
go and tell.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.760
Go and tell.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.280
Father, we love you.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.520
We thank you for loving us.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.580
We thank you for this passage of Scripture in Mark 5.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.380
We know that the truth is recorded

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.140
by Matthew and Luke as well.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.940
God, we thank You for the way in which

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.100
this passage reveals to us

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.020
the conversion of this man.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.660
This evening as we focus in upon

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.940
the commission for this man,

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.260
we make application in our own lives.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.680
Lord, we understand that You've left us here for a purpose.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.840
And that purpose is to go and tell.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.800
I'm thankful that as believers

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.680
in what we would refer to as the church age,

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.800
that we go in the power

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.520
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.200
The power of the Holy Spirit.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.980
I'm thankful You've given us the privilege

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.940
and opportunity to go and tell.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.340
God, I believe that each person

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.540
that's here this evening

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.140
would readily testify of the great things

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.140
that You've done for us.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.700
How You've changed our lives.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.620
The miracle of salvation.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.900
And how precious that is.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.180
And God, I pray that we'd go

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.480
in the simplicity of that message

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.360
and share that truth with the lost and dying world.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.080
That we'd simply be able to share with them,

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.800
can I tell you?

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.540
What the Lord's done for me.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.600
Can I tell you how He's changed me?

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.559
I pray that You'd use us.

00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:40.160
Give us courage and boldness.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.279
Help us, Lord, to be faithful and obedient

00:44:43.279 --> 00:44:45.400
even as this man,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.860
who upon receiving the commission,

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.619
embraced it,

00:44:51.619 --> 00:44:55.260
departed and published.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.339
All men did marvel.

00:44:57.339 --> 00:44:59.100
Help us, Lord.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.180
I pray that You'd have Your will and way

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.220
in the time of invitation

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.180
that decisions would be made

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.020
that would please Thee

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:03.860
and we'll thank You for it.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.339
In Christ's name we pray.

00:45:05.339 --> 00:45:06.180
Would you stand with me?

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.180
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.580
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.580
As she does, the altar...
