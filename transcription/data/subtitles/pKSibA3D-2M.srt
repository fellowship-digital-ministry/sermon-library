1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
there with me, please, to Psalm 122. Not my message, but I'm glad to see you all here

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,720
tonight. Amen. Here we are on a Tuesday night. It's the third day of the revival meetings

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,260
and I'm thankful that you're here tonight. I praise the Lord for that. Thank you for

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,440
coming and being faithful to the house of God and supporting your fall revival meeting.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,639
Psalm 122, it's another one of David's song of degrees. It's a Davidic psalm, certainly

6
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:29,079
put the music, and this is a particular psalm that I love, the first verse there. It says

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,919
David says, I was glad. See that? He said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,360
go into the house of the Lord. Now I'll tell you, there's a, there's a message all of its

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,240
own right there. That'll preach real good. David said, I was glad. That word glad, there's

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,159
a very interesting word. In the Hebrew it's tzolmach and it means this. It means to be

11
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,259
merry, to exult, to be gleesome, to be cheerful, to be joyful, to be excited. Amen. It means

12
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,799
to come to the house of God with great expectation. When we come to church, we should come to

13
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,800
church expecting God to do something. And you know, God wants to show up in a meeting.

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,279
That's why we have prayer before the service. That's why we want to make sure we commit

15
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:19,040
and consecrate everything unto the Lord because we want the Lord to show up. We want the Lord

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,519
to do something. I remember years ago, evangelist Harold Vaughn said, it's good to be in town

17
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:31,059
when God shows up. And there's a lot of truth to that. And I'm glad that we've seen meetings

18
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:35,059
over the years where God has certainly showed up. And I'll tell you, it was a hallelujah

19
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:39,620
time and we thank the Lord for that. But David said, listen, I was glad when they said unto

20
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,980
me, let us go into the house of the Lord. So it's good for us to be here tonight. I've

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,900
already enjoyed the fellowship. We stood at the back door and we greeted people as they

22
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:53,879
came in and we've talked a little bit this evening and we've spent some time together

23
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,139
and just in fellowship. And I've enjoyed that. I don't know what I'd do without the fellowship

24
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:03,599
of God's people. I just say to my wife, I said, I sure am glad that I have you because

25
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,479
as we travel, us being together is a blessing because otherwise you get pretty lonely. And

26
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,880
so I'm glad that we have that companionship, that fellowship and that partnership in ministry.

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:25,000
My family is many miles away from us. They're all up in Alaska and all my daughters up there

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,720
and my son-in-law who pastors a church in Sterling, Alaska is up there. And then our

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,119
five grandchildren and our 14 great-grandchildren. And so we only get to see them maybe once

30
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:39,240
a year, maybe twice. And every once in a while they'll come down to California. They're smart.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,639
Amen. They get out of there in the winter and either come to California or go to Hawaii.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,119
Wowee, mawee. And so we don't get to go up there that much. And so we miss our family

33
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:57,000
and we don't have any family left in California. So it's just us and us too. And so I'm thankful

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,639
for the fellowship of my wife, but what a blessing family is. What a joy it is to be

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,240
able to fellowship with your family, but your family too. We're all part of the family of God.

36
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,720
And so we can gather together in this place and we can enjoy the fellowship one with another.

37
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,960
I've said this many times, I've been in 36 countries in the world in my lifetime.

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,679
And you can't go anywhere where you don't, you find brothers and sisters everywhere you go.

39
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:28,440
You find believers everywhere you go. It's amazing to me, you can find believers in some

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,199
of the most bizarre places. And it's a joy and it's a blessing to know that we have brothers

41
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:38,679
and sisters in Christ around the world that we can fellowship with. I found them in some pretty

42
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:44,119
interesting places. And so praise the Lord for that. Amen. The fellowship of the saints is a joy

43
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:49,479
and it's a blessing. So I'm glad that we're here tonight. I think we should be glad we are able to

44
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,360
come here tonight. I'm thankful for the liberty, the freedom we have in America to gather together

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,279
in this place and to have fellowship one with another. A lot of gallant men paid for our liberty

46
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:04,759
and our freedom with their blood on the battlefields of wars that have been fought

47
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,160
in this country to keep us free. And so we ought to thank God for that. We're a free people.

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,360
Now there's a lot of things going on in America today that people are getting concerned about.

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,119
They wonder how much longer we're going to have our freedom. Well, listen, we have freedom. We

50
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:22,359
are a free country. And as long as we have it, we ought to praise God for it. It's a precious thing.

51
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,640
It's a precious thing. Amen. If you've ever talked to anybody who came from a communist

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,600
country, you'll know when they come here, they realize what a joy it is to live in the United

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,160
States of America. I'm getting a little bit tired of people complaining about this country.

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,399
And by the way, we don't have to make excuses to anybody. We don't need to, listen, friends,

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,399
we don't need to ask the forgiveness of anybody. We've done so much for the world and we've been

56
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,839
so gracious to the world and we've shared our abundance with the world. So we have no apologies

57
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,760
to make. Would you agree with that? It's a wonderful thing to be an American. I thank God

58
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,200
that I was born here. And we have our brother and sister down here that came from countries down in

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,079
Central America and praise the Lord for them. And now they're here in our great country and

60
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,679
they're Americans. Praise the Lord. We're with a bunch of Filipino people in our home church,

61
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:17,239
and they're all Americans now, and they rejoice in that. And they all, hey, listen, let me tell

62
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:22,040
you what, on Veterans Day, all of our Filipino brethren are in their uniforms because 90%

63
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,839
of our men are retired from the United States Navy. So we praise the Lord for that. Amen.

64
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,880
We've got freedom and we have freedom that we ought to rejoice in. All right,

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,239
2 Timothy chapter four in your Bible tonight, that was free by the way, I just thought I'd

66
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:38,519
share that. 2 Timothy chapter four in verse seven, if you didn't already get it, I have a patriot,

67
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,799
I love my country. 2 Timothy chapter four in verse seven. We're going to start there tonight and

68
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:48,920
we're going to move over to the Old Testament in a minute. But 2 Timothy chapter four in verse

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,480
seven, I shared this verse along with one over in Acts chapter 20. Maybe we'll look at that just

70
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,920
in a minute as well, on Saturday with the men's prayer breakfast. But I want you to look at 2

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Timothy four in verse seven. If you will, if you can, please let's stand out of respect for the

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,040
reverence and for the respect and reverence for the reading of God's word tonight. 2 Timothy

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,760
chapter four in verse seven. I'll read the one verse silently, then you can just follow along

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,320
silently, then we'll pray and get into the message God has for us tonight. Now the Apostle Paul

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:25,559
speaking here and says this, he said, I fought a good fight. He said, by the way, I've finished my

76
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:32,920
course and also I've kept the faith. But I want you to look at that word, the operative word there

77
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:41,239
in that particular verse of scripture is finished. Paul finished. And I believe he finished a lot

78
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:47,559
stronger than the way he started, but he finished. He never deviated from his course. He never

79
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:51,559
changed course. Now, perhaps along the way, he had to make some course corrections. And then I

80
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,959
suggest to you tonight that when we start talking about revival, revival really is a course

81
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,559
correction for many people that maybe have gotten off course and gotten going in the wrong direction

82
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,279
and not been heading in a direction that God has established for them in their Christian life.

83
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,679
And they need a course correction and they've gotten back on course. The Spirit of God has

84
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,920
nudged them back on the course again. Now, I don't know about you, but I want to finish strong.

85
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,679
I don't want to, listen, friends, I don't want to finish weak. I want to finish strong.

86
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,839
When my time comes to close my eyes in death and go be with the Lord Jesus, I want to be able to

87
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,519
say, I finished my course. That should be the desire of every Christian. We should want to

88
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,880
finish our course and we should want to finish it well. And I think that's an important thing.

89
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,320
It's a biblical imperative that we do so. Too many people are reversing course or getting

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,920
off course and going in the wrong direction. And we see a lot of that going on today. There's a

91
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:55,559
lot of apostasy going on today in the world, not just in America. And so we want to be good

92
00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:00,040
course keepers. We're going to talk about that tonight by God's grace for just the next few

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,880
minutes. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the reading of that word tonight. We ask God you'd

94
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,720
meet with us now and that you would help us. Help me. I'm a needy preacher. I'm going to need

95
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,160
your help. If I'm going to preach this message tonight, the way you've impressed it upon my

96
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,239
heart. Spirit of God, do that which only you can do. And Lord, use me tonight as a vessel unto

97
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:22,359
honor. God, use me tonight to be your vessel. Lord, speak through me as your conduit. Lord,

98
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:26,519
I pray that you'd fill me with thy spirit and wipe my lips. God, help me not to say anything

99
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,440
tonight, but what it would bring praise and glory and honor to your name. We'll thank you for it

100
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,479
now in Jesus' name and for his sake. And to this I do say, amen and amen. Thank you. May be seated.

101
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,679
A couple of years ago, I began thinking about the big differences that

102
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,719
little things make. Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever thought about the big

103
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:53,960
differences that little things make? And I could probably give you a long list of all the

104
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,679
little things that we allow into our lives that end up being, making big differences. I mean,

105
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,599
it's amazing to me how big a list we could possibly come up with. And like I said, if I

106
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:08,520
really want to finish my course strong for the Lord Jesus Christ, I want to make sure that I

107
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,799
stay on track, to stay on course. I want to read this to you very quickly as I get into my message.

108
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,479
I happened to see this not too awful long ago and I pieced this together and I wrote it down so I

109
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:25,320
wouldn't forget it. And so I want to read this to you. In precision aeronautical navigation,

110
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,080
coursekeeping and maintaining the proper heading is critical if one expects to arrive at their

111
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:39,719
desired destination. Truly direction determines destination. Consider that if an aviator deviates

112
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:45,159
just one degree from the correct heading, he or she can miss the arrival airport by a considerable

113
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:52,280
distance. It is therefore vitally important that one stay exactly on course at all times.

114
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,400
Whether in nautical or aeronautical navigation,

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,719
one must stay the course without deviation if one is to arrive at his or her

116
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,639
exact destination.

117
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,039
Course keeping is vitally important and essential

118
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,319
in all types of navigation.

119
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,539
Getting off course by as little as one degree

120
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:11,079
in long range navigation can mean missing the mark

121
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,959
by hundreds of miles.

122
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,399
It is theorized that this is exactly what happened

123
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,399
to Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan as they attempted

124
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,199
to circumnavigate the world in the late 1930s.

125
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,559
It is thought that faulty navigation placed them

126
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,759
75 miles or more from Howland Island

127
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,279
where they were to land for refueling.

128
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,559
Running out of fuel, they may have simply crashed

129
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,239
into the sea, which is what I personally believe they did.

130
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:40,119
But in precision navigation, there can be absolutely

131
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:43,299
no deviation from the prescribed course.

132
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:46,019
Many a ship has been run aground or been broken up

133
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,319
upon shoals and reefs when navigational charts

134
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,519
were not followed precisely.

135
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,039
By way of illustration, if off course by one degree

136
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,319
after one foot of travel, the target would be missed

137
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,679
by .2 inches.

138
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,599
After 100 yards of travel, the target would be missed

139
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,179
by 5.2 feet.

140
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,119
After one mile of travel, the target would be missed

141
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,039
by 92.2 feet.

142
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,279
If flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles,

143
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,719
the target would be missed by six miles.

144
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:18,179
Flying from San Francisco to Washington, D.C.,

145
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,359
the target would be missed by 42.6 miles,

146
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,999
placing the aircraft on the other side of Baltimore.

147
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,679
If flying around the globe from Washington, D.C. and back,

148
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,399
the target would be missed by 435 miles,

149
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,659
ending up in Boston.

150
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,319
If traveling to the moon, as did the astronauts,

151
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,759
flying the Apollo missions, and you were off course

152
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,199
by only one degree, the target destination would be missed

153
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,719
by 4,169 miles.

154
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,079
If one were able to fly to the nearest star

155
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,759
and there was a mere one degree course deviation,

156
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,719
the target would be missed by 441 billion miles.

157
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,799
One degree can make a phenomenal difference.

158
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,799
Yes, direction does indeed determine destination.

159
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,479
That's pretty amazing, isn't it?

160
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:12,299
All you have to do is get off course by one degree,

161
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,199
one degree of deviation from course,

162
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,379
and it can end you up in the wrong place.

163
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,639
You can end up at the wrong destination.

164
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,779
It can get you in an awful lot of trouble.

165
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,399
When I was taking flying lessons several years ago,

166
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,559
my flight instructor kept telling me all the time,

167
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,119
keep course, man, keep course.

168
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,159
Pay attention to your course.

169
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,399
Don't be deviating from course.

170
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,679
You do your cross countries, you better stay on course,

171
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,119
because it's a three-leg cross country.

172
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:43,599
And you're all by yourself, and you better be sure

173
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,919
that you properly navigate it.

174
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,439
That course that's been set before you,

175
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,779
you're getting up in the wrong place.

176
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,059
So deviation from the course in navigation

177
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,659
is a dangerous thing.

178
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,379
Just one degree can place you off course,

179
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,579
and you'd not arrive at your destination

180
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,899
as you're supposed to arrive to.

181
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,139
Now, that's an amazing thing.

182
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,819
But let me apply that to your Christian life

183
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,619
and my Christian life.

184
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,539
If you get off course by just the slightest little bit,

185
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,899
you're gonna end up in trouble.

186
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,259
You're gonna end up in the wrong place.

187
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,359
You're gonna end up doing the wrong thing.

188
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,959
Amen?

189
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,599
You're gonna end up displeasing God, by the way,

190
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,299
and we certainly don't wanna do that.

191
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,399
And any time we find ourselves drifting off course,

192
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
the most important thing for us to do

193
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,999
is to engage in a course reset.

194
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,919
We need to get back on course again.

195
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,999
Course correction is extremely important.

196
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,599
Over in Acts chapter 20,

197
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,939
and no need to go there in verse 24,

198
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,119
Paul said this, that his greatest desire

199
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:48,079
was that he might finish his course with joy.

200
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,399
And the ministry which I've received of the Lord Jesus

201
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,199
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

202
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,679
He said, I wanna make sure that throughout

203
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,019
my entire ministry that I stay on course.

204
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,399
I don't wanna deviate from the course

205
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,199
that God has set for me,

206
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,679
so that I can finish my course with joy.

207
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,559
And it's not a very joyful thing

208
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,839
when you get yourself off course

209
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,999
and find yourself at the wrong destination.

210
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,239
Sin many times take you farther than you wanna go

211
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,559
and take you in places where you shouldn't be.

212
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,359
And it can cause you a heartache

213
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,279
that you just never thought you'd ever experience

214
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,879
in your life.

215
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,399
So for you and I, I think it's an important principle,

216
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,919
a very simple thing, but a mere one degree of difference

217
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,359
can cause us to have some pretty serious problems.

218
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,359
That's why God has given us

219
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,559
a navigation chart right here, amen?

220
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,059
It's better than any section chart I've ever seen.

221
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,439
Section charts, sometimes they make mistakes

222
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,279
in putting together these Jepson section charts,

223
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,599
but I'm gonna tell you what,

224
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,399
this is the best section chart in the world, man.

225
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,639
If you just follow this section chart right here,

226
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,719
just follow this right here, you'll never get off course.

227
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,239
This is why God has given us this word

228
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,559
as God's instruction manual,

229
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,999
it's God's owner manual for you and me.

230
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,639
Listen, I don't belong to myself.

231
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
When I got saved, I no longer belong to me.

232
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,839
I'm bought with a price, I belong to the Savior.

233
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,399
And he's my navigator.

234
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,559
God ought to be your navigator.

235
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,079
You ever seen people, the bumper stickers on their car

236
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,199
said God is my pilot and I'm the co-pilot?

237
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,599
No, no, listen, he's the navigator.

238
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,159
He's the one that navigates us to make sure that we,

239
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,359
if we would stay on track and stay on course,

240
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,999
we're gonna end up at the right destination.

241
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,819
Now, praise the Lord,

242
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:27,299
when you get saved by the grace of God,

243
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,159
you're going to end up in the right destination.

244
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,559
You're gonna end up in heaven, amen?

245
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,719
If you're saved by the grace of God, you're heaven bound.

246
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,239
But when it comes to the Christian life,

247
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,399
we ought to realize we can end up

248
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,519
heading in the wrong direction

249
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,799
and finish up our lives in a way

250
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,079
which is displeasing to the Lord.

251
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,959
And I don't know about you,

252
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
but when I stand before the Lord Jesus one day

253
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,639
and I have to give an answer

254
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,199
for that which has been done in my body,

255
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,519
that which has been done in the flesh,

256
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,719
whether it be good or bad,

257
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,559
I want to be able to say,

258
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,359
Lord, I did my best to keep course.

259
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,559
And when I got off course,

260
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,399
I tried to make course correction every time I could

261
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,119
and I consulted, I consulted the owner's manual

262
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,279
to make sure that I got back on course properly.

263
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
We need to stay on course.

264
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,939
Get off course by one degree and you've got problems.

265
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,559
Amen?

266
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,119
First Kings chapter 11.

267
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,999
First Kings chapter 11.

268
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,879
There's nothing really profound about this.

269
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,319
It's just really, to me, it's just very, very practical

270
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,759
when you stop and think about getting off course.

271
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,699
First Kings chapter 11, a familiar passage of scripture,

272
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,479
but every time I read through this,

273
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,379
I see here's a brother got off course.

274
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:35,059
I mean, Solomon got way off course.

275
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,319
Now, it's an interesting thing

276
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,719
when you look at Solomon's life.

277
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,759
Remember what Solomon did?

278
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,919
If you look back in chapter three,

279
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,159
which we will go back there a little bit later on.

280
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,239
If you go back to chapter three,

281
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,319
you can see that Solomon asked God for what?

282
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,599
He asked him for wisdom.

283
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,759
Now, God would have given him anything that he asked for,

284
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,439
but he asked for wisdom.

285
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,199
He said, now, I'm just like a little child.

286
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,479
I don't know how to lead this life so great a people.

287
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,399
And Lord, if I'm going to do this,

288
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,639
if I'm going to lead these people, as did David, my father,

289
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,999
I'm going to have to have wisdom.

290
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:07,199
And God, I need your wisdom.

291
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,279
And I think that really pleased the Lord.

292
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,439
That he asked that of himself

293
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,559
rather than asked for riches and wealth

294
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,399
and all the things that a king would,

295
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,519
you would think that a king would be entitled to.

296
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,119
By the way, later on in life, God gave him that too.

297
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,299
God gave him wealth and God provided him with things

298
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,039
that were just absolutely marvelous things,

299
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,879
wonderful things.

300
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,659
I mean, he had amazing wealth.

301
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,719
They say that he may well have been

302
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,819
one of the wealthiest men that ever lived.

303
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:38,739
But somewhere along the line, Solomon got off course.

304
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,739
You know, look at this very quickly.

305
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:44,179
Look at 1 Kings chapter 11,

306
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,739
and I'm going to read down through this pretty quickly,

307
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:47,019
so stick with me.

308
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:48,299
By the way, let me do this.

309
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,219
Let's go over, if you look over,

310
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,459
we don't need to read the whole chapter.

311
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,539
If you look at 1 Kings chapter 10,

312
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,819
we know the queen of Sheba came to visit him

313
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,819
because she said, I've heard about your kingdom.

314
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,859
I've heard about your wealth.

315
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,139
I've heard about all that you have.

316
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:02,499
I've heard about everything associated with your kingdom.

317
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,619
She came to see for herself if it was true.

318
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,179
You remember she came, and what did Solomon do?

319
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,699
Well, he trotted out all of his wealth.

320
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,179
He trotted out all the things that he had,

321
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:12,539
everything that God gave to him.

322
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,519
He trotted all that out.

323
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,419
I think some pride was involved in that.

324
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,779
You can see, as you go down through chapter 10,

325
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,259
you can see how she saw this,

326
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,779
and she was amazed by what she saw.

327
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,679
I would have been amazed, and so would have you been,

328
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,019
to have been able to see all that God had blessed him with.

329
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,739
And by the way, God blessed him with it.

330
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,379
Hey, friends, let me tell you this.

331
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,239
We don't get wealth at our own hand.

332
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,299
Any wealth that we have comes from the hand of God.

333
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,539
And God told the children of Israel that.

334
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,699
He said, don't you think that you earned your own wealth,

335
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,539
and it came from you?

336
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,459
It came from me.

337
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,259
And anytime you get to thinking that it came from you,

338
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,759
you know, these self-made men, they say,

339
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,939
well, I'm a self-made man,

340
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,259
and nobody ever gave me anything.

341
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,679
Everything I have, I earned myself.

342
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,739
Let me tell you what, that is, as far as I'm concerned,

343
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,179
that's an arrogant statement.

344
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:00,419
Because even what the heathen has, God gave to him.

345
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:02,979
He didn't get that on his own.

346
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,939
And so I thank God for that.

347
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,099
God has blessed me.

348
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,299
I don't know how he's, I'm sure he's blessed you as well.

349
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,179
But he sees it, but she saw all this.

350
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,019
But look in 1 Kings 10, verse 24.

351
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,259
After he trots out all this wealth that he has,

352
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,699
and she sees all this, and it says,

353
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:22,979
all the earth sought the psalm,

354
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:26,219
and to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

355
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,059
And they brought every man as present,

356
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,259
vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments,

357
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,939
and armor and spices and horses and mules,

358
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:33,899
arrayed year by year.

359
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,500
So people are just bringing all this wealth to him.

360
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,939
That's amazing.

361
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:40,859
Verse 20, and Solomon gathered together chariots

362
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:45,699
and horsemen, and he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen,

363
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,819
whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots

364
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,819
with the king of Jerusalem.

365
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,500
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem,

366
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,979
as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees

367
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:59,259
that are in the veil for abundance.

368
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:00,099
And Solomon.

369
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,399
had horses brought out of Egypt in linen yarn, and king's

370
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,999
merchants received a linen yarn at a price. And a chariot

371
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,839
came up and went out of Egypt, and six hundred shekels of

372
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:12,239
silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so all

373
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,379
the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did

374
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,819
they bring him out by their means." All right, now I'm

375
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,079
going to jump into chapter 11. We may come back and look at

376
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,899
this again. But, now I want you to see that word, but.

377
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,859
Anytime I see that word, but, in the Bible I say, well here

378
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:36,259
it comes, but. I look this word up, it appears many times

379
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,159
in the Bible. You see it throughout the Word of God,

380
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:44,199
this word, B-U-T, but. But, but, but, King Solomon, look

381
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:50,739
at this, loved many strange women. Now that word, stranger,

382
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,879
is an interesting word. If you look it up in the Hebrew it

383
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,879
means alien, it means heathen, it means pagan, also it means

384
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:02,279
harlot, it could mean harlot as well. So, he loved many

385
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,279
strange women. These were women who were pagan women, they

386
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,279
were heathen women, they weren't godly women, they

387
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,519
weren't Jews, these were women from alien countries, from

388
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,519
other nations. And so notice it says, and King Solomon loved.

389
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,559
Now the word love there is Ahab, or Ahab, and it's the

390
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,739
same basic word as Eros in the New Testament, it's a sexual

391
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,899
affection, or it's lust is what it is. So the love that he had

392
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,759
for these women wasn't agape love, it was lust. So he lusted

393
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,559
after these women. So he had a real woman problem. And he

394
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,599
wasn't the only one in the Old Testament that had a woman

395
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:41,479
problem. So, King Solomon loved many, he didn't say just a

396
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,039
few, it says many strange women. Look at this, watch now,

397
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,239
I want you to note this, we're going to go back and look at

398
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,239
this, many strange women together with the daughter of

399
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,879
Pharaoh. Oh, now you've got to mark that because we're going

400
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,799
to go back and take a look at that in a few minutes. Along

401
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,779
with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, the

402
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,139
Ammonites, the Edomites, the Zidonians, and the Hittites.

403
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,579
Watch now, of the nations concerning which the Lord said

404
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:13,759
unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in unto them,

405
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,019
neither shall they come unto you, for surely they will turn

406
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,859
away your heart. And of course we see in Exodus 34, 16 what

407
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,279
God has to say about that. God said, listen you don't want to

408
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,919
be marrying these pagan women, these heathen women from these

409
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:31,559
alien countries because what they're going to do when you

410
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,759
get involved with these women is, is they're going to turn

411
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,459
your heart away from the God of Heaven. So don't do it, He

412
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:43,199
said, don't do it. God said, don't do it. Now you can see

413
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:47,339
He's going off course, can you not? Now let me say this,

414
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,159
going off course has its consequences. It has serious

415
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:57,099
consequences. Every sin that you and I commit, every

416
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:00,599
deviation from the Word of God, every time we get off

417
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:03,239
course, I guarantee you there are going to be

418
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:10,379
consequences. Let me tell you Solomon is going to experience

419
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:17,219
some consequences. So verse 2 again, and let me, I want to

420
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,999
go back to verse 1, I want to read the two together,

421
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,339
But King Solomon loved many strange women, together with

422
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,839
the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,

423
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,779
Idonians, Edomites, Idonians, and Hittites, of the nations

424
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:30,619
concerning which the Lord sent unto the children of Israel.

425
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,619
Ye shall not go into them, neither shall they come in

426
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,019
unto you. For surely they will turn away your heart after

427
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:41,759
their gods, little g, but Solomon claimed unto these in

428
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,539
love. So in other words he claimed unto them as a result

429
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,319
of his lust, the lust of his flesh, the lust of his flesh.

430
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,699
But I tell you what that's a dangerous thing. Amen. I've

431
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,499
told my wife I don't know how many times when we've been

432
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,739
counseling with people, especially with folks with

433
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,939
marital problems and perhaps there is infidelity going on.

434
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:08,379
And maybe there is, we've got young men that maybe have

435
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:11,379
gotten themselves involved with an ungodly young woman, or

436
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,819
vice versa. And I've said, listen, I've said to my wife

437
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,639
many times, boy this thing of the female flesh is a

438
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,879
powerful thing. It's a powerful thing. I wrote this down in

439
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,179
my Bible so I wouldn't forget it. For me I wrote it down.

440
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:27,419
Satan will exploit a man's weaknesses and employ devices

441
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,319
to turn his heart from God. And he'll do it every time he

442
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,559
gets an opportunity. So Satan has devised a multitude of

443
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,059
evils to turn the hearts of God's people away from him. He

444
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:43,099
wants to get you off course. The devil wants to get you off

445
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,319
course. And that's exactly what was happening with

446
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,919
Solomon here. Verse 4, For it came to pass, when Solomon

447
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:54,299
was old, that his wives, well let me go back, I missed verse

448
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:57,699
3. And he had seven, now if I had missed this we'd have been

449
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:01,199
in trouble. And he had 700 wives, princesses, and 300

450
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:05,039
concubines, and his wives turned away his heart. And this

451
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:09,419
brother, what was this brother thinking? This guy's got 1,000

452
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:16,179
women. What is he thinking? I'll tell you what, he had to

453
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:19,679
just, he had to be out of his mind. He's got himself 1,000

454
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,519
wives. Someone said, well he had a lot of trophy wives. Well, I

455
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,919
guess so. But he had 1,000 wives. That's a lot of

456
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,059
hosiery over the shower curtain, amen? I'm telling you

457
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:33,559
man, 1,000 wives. Hey, listen you've got more than one woman

458
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,399
in the house. You've got two women in the kitchen, you've

459
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:41,719
got a problem. I happened to be watching, we were in a hotel

460
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,959
and I turned the TV on, sometimes you wish you didn't

461
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,859
do that. But I turned the TV on and I got this thing on there

462
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:49,699
called, Sister Wives. I don't know if you've ever seen that.

463
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:52,799
But it's this guy, it's supposed to be a Reformed

464
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,839
Mormon that's practicing polygamy, because he said

465
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:00,319
Joseph Smith said it's ok. So, he's practicing polygamy and

466
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:02,719
he's got I think seven or eight wives, or whatever it is. And

467
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,879
they try to get on there and tell you that, oh, we never

468
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:07,159
have any issues with each other. We are not jealous of

469
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,399
one another. We all get along with each other. Well, they're

470
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:15,399
all lying. Amen. I've got an amen out of this crowd. Praise

471
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:18,139
the Lord, that's right brother, amen. I want to tell you

472
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,379
what, seven women in one household like that. I'm

473
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,879
talking about wives. These women are all wives, they're

474
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,219
supposed to be wives. Well, God never prescribed that. God

475
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:31,659
never authorized that. You go back to Genesis chapter 2 and

476
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:34,059
it's right there, one man for one woman for one lifetime.

477
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,639
God never authorized polygamy. He never did, but they did it

478
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,279
anyway in spite of what God said. And now you've got, this

479
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,719
guy's got seven wives in one house and he's sitting there

480
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,579
smiling, these women are all fighting over him. And I look

481
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:50,019
at this guy and I said, man I haven't got any idea why

482
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:57,459
anybody would fight over this dude. Amen. Man, he's one ugly

483
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:04,979
fellow. I mean I don't understand that. And these

484
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,039
gals are all fighting over this guy. And they say, oh, we've

485
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,039
got peace here. And I said, I don't believe that. I remember

486
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:14,179
my grandmother, bless her heart, she was an old Irish woman

487
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:17,779
and I was adopted, so I'm not Irish, I'm Scottish and French,

488
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,859
but what a combination that is. But my grandmother, my

489
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,159
mother's mother was Irish, her father was from County Cork,

490
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,639
Ireland, and my grandmother was jealous of her kitchen. And I

491
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:32,239
tell you what, you better not go in her kitchen when she was

492
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,479
cooking. And the women in the family knew better than going

493
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,739
there when she was cooking. And they would have Thanksgiving or

494
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,839
Christmas or whatever it was and she'd be in there putting

495
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:44,019
the feast together, take her two or three days to do it and

496
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,659
get all the fixings done and everything else. And if

497
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,979
anybody had a tendency to venture into the kitchen while

498
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,219
she's cooking she'd say, I can still hear her say, scat,

499
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,519
scat, scat, scat, get out of my kitchen, she'd say. You know,

500
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,819
and the men don't dare even go anywhere near that kitchen. I

501
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,959
tell you that right now. You wouldn't even think about going

502
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,439
in there and stealing something to eat. And I mean, that's just

503
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:07,199
the way it was. And so can you imagine having a thousand women

504
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:12,679
in one household? Now, he's collecting women. Now, I

505
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:16,419
collect high-end airplane models. I like airplane models,

506
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:19,519
amen. I collect die-cast cars and stuff like that. I'm just

507
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,059
still got a little of the, you know, the boy left in me. So, I

508
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,819
collect that stuff, but I guarantee I'm not collecting

509
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,199
women. One woman is enough, amen. Now, I'm not saying that

510
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:34,059
in a deleterious manner or in a negative manner. I thank God for

511
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:37,159
my wife. She's all I need. I don't need any other women

512
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:41,099
around. Praise the Lord, amen. She don't want any other women

513
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,839
around either, I'll tell you that right now. So, he had 700

514
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,239
wives, princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives, all

515
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,279
these women, turned away his heart. For it came to pass,

516
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,739
when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart

517
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,979
after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with the Lord,

518
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:04,479
his God, as was the heart of David his father. Boy, there's

519
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,179
an indictment right there. You know the Bible says that David

520
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:12,099
was a man after God's own heart. Now, in 1 Kings chapter 3 the

521
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,399
Bible says that Solomon loved the Lord, but he didn't love

522
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,199
God as much as his father did. I think David loved God much

523
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:22,259
more deeply, much more personally, much more

524
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,440
intimately. I don't think Solomon had that same

525
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,799
relationship with God that his father had. I think his

526
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,399
relationship was very different. And so, now he's been

527
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,339
turned aside by all these women, and by all this lust and

528
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,019
everything else. And the basic fact is, is now he's not only

529
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,259
just off one degree, now he's off course by a whole bunch.

530
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:49,119
Now, getting back on course again is difficult. You get,

531
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:51,819
friends, if you and I get too far off course sometimes to get

532
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,159
that course adjustment to get us back to where we need to be

533
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:59,199
can be very, very difficult, very difficult. And so, he's

534
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:02,599
now, he's not just off course, he's off course by a whole

535
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:06,199
bunch. He's off course by a whole bunch. And so, he's not

536
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:09,440
just off course by a whole bunch, he's off course by a

537
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,440
distracted. The devil has got his foot in the door. Satan

538
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,980
has done his dirty, dastardly work. He's employed devices

539
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,480
which turned away Solomon's heart from God. And now he's

540
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,320
way off course. Now let me say this, there is no way that

541
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,000
God is pleased with him in this situation. No way.

542
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,400
Someone said, well don't you think God winked at this? God

543
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,860
does not wink at sin. Well don't you think God was

544
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,400
exorcising His permissive will here? Listen, God doesn't

545
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,340
have a permissive will when it comes to sin. Sin is sin in

546
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,040
the sight of God and God hates sin. And we need to

547
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,880
recognize how much He does hate it. And so now he's way

548
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,080
off course and he's now had his heart turned away by

549
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,760
these women. Verse 5, For Solomon, now this is a sad,

550
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,020
sad statement here in Scripture. For Solomon went

551
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,060
after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and after

552
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,160
Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites. Now see that God

553
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,900
calls this false god of theirs an abomination. So

554
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,200
therefore it means to worship this god you had to engage in

555
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,880
abominable acts. Now I'm not going to describe to you what

556
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,840
they were because some of them are pretty terrible. But they

557
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,639
had to engage in abominable acts because this was an

558
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,279
abominable, abominable god, this false god. Now verse 6

559
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:33,940
look at this, this is sad. This man whom God gave all

560
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,819
this wisdom to and all this wealth to, look at this in

561
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,560
verse 6, And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and

562
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,220
went not fully after the LORD as did David his father. See

563
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,459
that backs up the statement I made to you a minute ago that

564
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,000
Solomon did not love God as deeply as did David. David

565
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,500
loved the Lord with all of his heart. Now did David sin? Did

566
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,500
he get off track? Did he get off course? Yes. But praise

567
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,400
the Lord David was known to make course corrections. I can

568
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,000
see it in Psalm 51 after that thing that he did with

569
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,600
Bathsheba and God broke him and he got right with the

570
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,700
Lord, amen. When he confessed that sin, when he repented of

571
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,139
that sin, when he turned away from that sin, when he

572
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,940
forsook that sin God restored him again to fellowship. He

573
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,839
made a course correction that he knew he needed to make in

574
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,680
order to get back to where he needed to be. Had he not done

575
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,680
that, that lack of being on course would have run him

576
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,339
smack into a wall somewhere and he'd end up crashed and

577
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,540
burned. So praise the Lord for that testimony. And by the

578
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,240
way, the man of God said to him, it's a good thing that

579
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,479
you made that course correction because if you had not

580
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,779
repented of your sin and got right with God you'd have been

581
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,020
a dead man because he said, now that you've repented surely

582
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,800
thou shalt not die. So that tells me that God had signed

583
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,260
His death warrant, and he wouldn't have lived past 50.

584
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:56,279
It was around the time that he did this thing with

585
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,119
Bathsheba. Now did it affect his life? Yes, things were

586
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,320
never the same again because there are consequences for

587
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,300
sin, and you have to live with those consequences. You've

588
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,100
got to live with them once you make that decision. Verse 7,

589
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:14,600
Then did Solomon, this is amazing to me as well, then

590
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,800
did Solomon build in high place for Chemosh the

591
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,860
abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jerusalem,

592
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,260
and for Molech. Now it's an amazing thing, Molech they

593
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,760
used to do child sacrifice to Molech and they would burn

594
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,699
their children in the fire. Not only that but the Moabite

595
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,380
God, their greatest God of all was Dagon the fish god.

596
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,839
There were so many other gods that they worshipped, false

597
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,040
gods and all the rest that goes along with it that it's

598
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,160
amazing to me that Solomon got so far off course that he was

599
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:51,199
willing to worship these false gods. And by the way put not

600
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,300
on himself but the kingdom in jeopardy. Now hear this, if

601
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:59,339
you get nothing else let's get this. Listen I said this the

602
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,380
other day, your choices and my choices when we decide that

603
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,839
we are going to sin against God it doesn't just affect us

604
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,020
it affects others. In this case it affected his home, it

605
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,240
affected his offspring, it affected the nation, the whole

606
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:16,240
nation was affected by this and it brought consequences upon

607
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:23,380
them. Bad choices. Verse 8, And likewise did he for all his

608
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:27,179
strange wives. He did all this for these women which burnt

609
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,059
incense and sacrificed unto their gods. Let me say this he

610
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,559
did this for these women, he wanted to please these women

611
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:43,580
rather than please God. Isn't that something? I don't know

612
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,679
how many times I've seen young people get hooked up with the

613
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,320
wrong individual, the wrong mate. I've told young people

614
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,820
this for years in counseling this way for years. I've said

615
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,700
listen don't be out getting on this Christian mingle thing

616
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,299
and all these websites, all these chat rooms or whatever

617
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:03,000
it is they do, this internet stuff and do this internet

618
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,140
dating thing. Don't be out shopping for a spouse. You let

619
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:09,640
God bring His choice in a spouse to you. And make sure you

620
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,179
marry right and make sure you marry in the Lord or don't get

621
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,519
married. I had a young woman say to me she said, what's the

622
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,200
secret of your long marriage? You folks have been married a

623
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,160
long time. She was getting ready to get married. I said,

624
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,660
it's work. You work at it. And you determine in your heart

625
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,899
that once you get married you stay married. And if you don't

626
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:38,339
plan on staying married don't get married. Am I right? I

627
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:45,080
think so. So now look, verse 8, And likewise did he for all his

628
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,720
strings wise which burnt incense, and sacrificed unto

629
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,720
their gods. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, well do you

630
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,920
think? Because his heart was turned from the Lord God of

631
00:35:55,959 --> 00:36:00,799
Israel, which He had appeared unto him twice, and commanded

632
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,260
him. By the way let me tell you this, God had given Solomon

633
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:07,000
more than enough revelation to know what was right. And had

634
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,480
commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go

635
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,779
after other gods, but he kept not that which the Lord

636
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,220
commanded. Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch

637
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,459
as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant

638
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,720
and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely

639
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,619
rend, that word rend in the Hebrew, ohabit means to tear

640
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,519
away or divide, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee,

641
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,880
and will give it to thy servant. I wish I had time to

642
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,660
just preach on that for a while. Notwithstanding in thy

643
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,619
days, I will not take it for David thy father's sake, but I

644
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,860
will rend it out of the hand of thy son. Howbeit I will not

645
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,860
rend away all the kingdoms, but will give one tribe to thy

646
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:47,839
son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's

647
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,299
sake, which I have chosen. This is all leading up to the

648
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,000
divided kingdom. And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto

649
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,580
Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, and he was the king of the

650
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,299
seed of Edom. Now I want to read something to you here very

651
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,940
quickly, and then I'm going to look at 1 Kings chapter 3.

652
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,839
Just listen to this, When thou art come unto the land which

653
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,380
the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it,

654
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,559
speaking to the children of Israel, and shalt dwell therein

655
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,119
and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the

656
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,000
nations that are about me. Thou shalt in any wise set him

657
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:21,700
king over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall choose. One from

658
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,760
among the brethren shalt thou set king over thee, thou mayest

659
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,119
not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother. But

660
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,920
he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people

661
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,559
to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply

662
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,600
horses. Forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ye shall

663
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,399
henceforth return no more that way. Listen, neither shall he

664
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,700
multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn him not away,

665
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,540
neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and

666
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,839
gold. Do you hear that? God said, listen, neither shall the

667
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:57,959
king multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away.

668
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,480
Oh, that's in Deuteronomy chapter 17. So, Solomon knew

669
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,040
this. Solomon couldn't cop out and say, I didn't know this,

670
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,920
God never told me this, I didn't know this was wrong. Come

671
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,179
on now, he knew it was wrong. He knew it was wrong when he

672
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,160
started doing it. He intentionally got off course.

673
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,720
It's like flying, you're flying the heading that's assigned to

674
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,220
you, or whatever heading you're supposed to be flying. And all

675
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,220
of a sudden you just decide, nope, not flying that way

676
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,860
anymore, I think I'll fly this way, or I think I'll fly this

677
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:36,760
way. And you get off the prescribed course, guess what?

678
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,200
You're not going to end up at your destination, and also too

679
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,299
you're liable to have a mid-air collision, or something else

680
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,780
is going to happen, or you're going to fly into weather.

681
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,340
There's all kinds of things you can do when you get off

682
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,460
course. Solomon knew what he was doing when he did it. And he

683
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,059
did it consciously, he did it intentionally, he did it

684
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:01,599
volitionally. It breaks my heart when I think about it.

685
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,739
Now, Solomon said, well I wouldn't do that, excuse me. Now

686
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,479
you might not gather yourself, sir you might not gather a

687
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,119
thousand wives and concubines. I don't know how you could ever

688
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,619
possibly do that in this day and age. I mean it would just,

689
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,340
well I guess some people might try to do that. But I mean

690
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,140
there is no way that most of us are ever going to even think

691
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:24,539
about that, but there are so many other areas where we get

692
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:31,220
off course. Listen to this, 1 Kings chapter 3 and verse 1,

693
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,220
someone asked me not too long ago, well, Brother Meshon where

694
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,159
did he get off course? Where did it start? When did he get

695
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
one degree off course, and get it in such a horrible

696
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,820
situation? 1 Kings chapter 3, verse 1, And Solomon made

697
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:55,419
affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's

698
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,700
daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he

699
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,159
had made an end of building his own house, and the house of

700
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,200
the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. Do you

701
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:08,979
see that? Before he had even asked for a

702
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:17,579
wisdom from the Lord, before he even got to that step, before it ever really got started,

703
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:25,139
right from the very get-go, he made affinity with Egypt. He became an ally to them, and

704
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:32,599
oh, and he took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David. He violated the

705
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,299
Word of God right there. He disobeyed God right there. He disobeyed what was stated

706
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:44,339
in Deuteronomy and other places of Scripture, not necessarily that text I wrote to you.

707
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,059
They weren't supposed to marry into these foreign women and take strange wives unto

708
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:54,519
themselves. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing. So that's where really

709
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,659
I think he got off course by just one degree, and he continued to go in that direction off

710
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:03,099
and on throughout his life, even though he had exercised great wisdom, and God blessed

711
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:11,259
him in so many ways, but yet in the end, what did he do? Not only did he disobey God,

712
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:17,579
but he ended up his life worshiping these false gods of these women that he gathered

713
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:27,499
unto himself and brought into his household. Man, he was way off course. Way off course.

714
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:32,099
We need to be good course keepers, friends. We need to make sure that we stay on course

715
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:37,419
because you get off course by just one degree, just one degree, and I guarantee you, you

716
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:42,459
are going to end up at the wrong destination. You're going to end up where God doesn't want

717
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:47,299
you to be. Remember what I said last night? The place to be is in the center of God's

718
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:57,819
perfect will. God's perfect will. I guess what I've done now, and really it should be

719
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,339
all of our prayer, I think, every day, my greatest desire when I lift my voice up in

720
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:09,099
God's prayer is this, Lord, please help me to stay in the very center of thy perfect

721
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:17,539
will. I never want to get out of God's will for me and for my life. Can you imagine how

722
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:30,419
it would affect not only your life and your ministry but your family? You know? You get

723
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:40,539
off into the wrong stuff, man, it can affect a lot of people. One sinner can do great harm

724
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:48,539
in a home, a family, a church. We need to stay on course. And there's so many of God's

725
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:54,699
people today that are off course, it's just egregious to me that people have gotten so

726
00:42:54,699 --> 00:43:02,499
far off course. What has happened to the thinking of God's people today where they've gotten

727
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:06,899
themselves turned upside down and right side, they're not right side up anymore, they're

728
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:12,059
upside down. They see good as evil and evil as good or they support sometimes things they

729
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:15,179
shouldn't support or get involved in things they ought not get involved in and they don't

730
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,579
even think twice, how does this affect my relationship with God? How does it affect

731
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:24,019
my walk with God? How does it affect my prayer life? How does it affect my devotional life?

732
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:32,019
How does it affect my church life? How does it affect my family life? And sometimes people

733
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:36,619
just don't think the way they ought to think and they don't use biblical reason, they don't

734
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:43,219
use the course that God has set for them in the Word of God and they exercise human logic

735
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:46,859
and they somehow figure out and think that I think this is alright, I don't think this

736
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,299
is a problem. Oh, God won't mind if I do this. Remember what I said about me robbing God

737
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:55,779
of tithes when I first got saved? I had exercised human logic thinking that God understands.

738
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:00,819
No, God does not understand sin. When God says that we're supposed to be doing something

739
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,099
and He says this is the course that you are to get on and keep then that's what we ought

740
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:09,539
to do. And God sees anything less than that as sin. There's no gray area, it's black and

741
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,459
white. Someone said to me one time when I was in the military, I had one of my men say

742
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:19,659
to me, you know what your problem is? Your problem is you're just too black and white.

743
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:24,019
I said, in the business we're in my friend, you better believe everything is black and

744
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:28,459
white because the ordinance manual is written in blood and when we're handling explosives,

745
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:33,779
I'm going to tell you what friends, there's absolutely no room for error whatsoever, ever,

746
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:40,539
ever, ever. Well listen friends, we're talking about things of eternity, of eternal value.

747
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:45,419
We're talking about things that are related to our walk with God and our service for God

748
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:49,899
and how it affects and influences everybody else and we get so selfish and self-centered

749
00:44:49,899 --> 00:44:54,539
sometimes that we don't realize and understand the choices we make affect other people and

750
00:44:54,539 --> 00:45:02,539
we get off course by just a degree. It can lead us to all sorts of dangerous conclusions.

751
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:12,139
Don't, don't, listen, don't stay off course. Get back on course. You remember that old

752
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:17,019
adage my mother used to say it to me all the time, son, you need to straighten up and fly

753
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:33,619
right. Right? Straighten up and fly right or suffer the consequences. And you knew it was

754
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:44,019
coming. Amen? And I used to tell my daughter all the time, listen, if you don't straighten up,

755
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:48,579
fly right, we're going to get academic. I'm going to apply the Board of Education to the seat of

756
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:57,979
understanding and we'll, we'll correct the issue and the attitude. And God's, He's trying to

757
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:02,459
correct us. I mean, when He sees when we get off just one degree, He tries to get us back on

758
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:10,059
course. You know how He does that? How can you read the Word of God and not be corrected? How

759
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,739
can you come to church like this and hear the preaching and not be corrected? I want your pastor

760
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:20,099
on live stream. I know what he's preaching. Amen? You can't, there's no way you get away from it.

761
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:27,819
God is providing you with everything you need to know in order to stay on course. So you don't

762
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:37,819
want to straighten up and fly right. That's your problem. I got to quit. I had a guy come to me one

763
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:41,899
night at my church when I was pastoring. He said, you know what, pastor, I'm just not getting fed

764
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:47,859
here. I said, is that right? He goes, yeah, I'm not getting fed here. I said, well, you know what

765
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:56,139
the problem is? You're just not eating. So I'm not going to spoon feed you. You should be past

766
00:46:56,139 --> 00:47:02,019
the pablum stage. And I said that to him graciously. I mean, as kindly as I could. But I said, brother,

767
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:05,939
listen, I've heard that all these years I've been in the ministry, I've heard that. That's just an

768
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:12,339
excuse. The truth of matter is, is you've got all course and you don't like it when the Word of God

769
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:16,899
points it out to you when something gets preached you don't like. He said, the truth of matter is,

770
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:23,059
I preached something today you didn't like. And you got your toe stepped on. Well, that's the

771
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:29,299
grace of God. God is doing everything He can to help us stay on course. And sometimes we reject

772
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:40,579
it. So you know what he did? He went someplace else to eat. And I can guarantee you he didn't

773
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:44,779
like what he got over there either. What do they think this is? They think there's a happy diner

774
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,859
here or something? No, we're preaching the Word of God. We're trying to help people to get on

775
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:52,499
course and stay there. All right, here's my question. We're going to stand a minute. Are you

776
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:57,299
on course? Or have you gotten off course? If there's any sin in your life that you're just

777
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:02,219
allowing to fester and you're letting the devil draw you off course, you need to get back on

778
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:08,699
course again. That's your responsibility. God says, if you will, I will. I mean, we just need

779
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:13,219
to make that course adjustment. Solomon would have been a whole lot better off had he done that. I

780
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:22,259
don't see that he did make a major course adjustment. Certainly not the way he should

781
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:30,459
have. And you can find men in the Bible that did. David was one, and there were others as well. Get

782
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:34,339
on course, amen? Let's straighten up and fly right. Let's all stand tonight with our heads

783
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:39,059
bowed, eyes closed. Let's stand as our sister comes to play the instrument for imitation season. I

784
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:45,820
don't know how God spoke in your heart tonight, but He sure has spoken to mine. I sure want to be
